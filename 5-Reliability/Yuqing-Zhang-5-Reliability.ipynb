    "Up until this week, we have assumed that the corpus you have used for analysis assignments represented a *meaningful* assemblage of texts from which reasonable inferences could be drawn about the social game, social world and social actors that produced it. This week, we ask you to articulate what your sample represents in context of your final project, and draw upon methods we have developed over the last three weeks to draw reasonable and representative samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "This week we also pivot from our recent work on unsupervized machine learning approaches to explore how we can get *human* readings of content at scale. We want to gather and utilize human responses for several reasons. First, we may want to use crowdsourced human scores as the primary method of coding, extracting or organizing content (as it was in the two of the assigned readings). Second, we may want to validate or tune a computational algorithm we may have developed in terms of how it is associated with human meanings or experience. Finally, we may want to use human coding on a sample of data as the basis for training a model or algorithm to then extrapolate *human-like* annotations to the entire population. Here intelligent sampling is critical to maximize effective maching training. \n",

This study will build on three previous studies on restaurant failure rates that have debunked the myth that nine out of ten restaurants fail in the first year. Building on the previous findings, instead of adopting traditional approaches, such as interpersonal interviews or surveys administrations, in my study, I will take on a different method to study why restaurants close by performing a detailed content analysis on Yelp reviews.

    "Good food and unique dining experiences have been playing import roles in human's life. The National Restaurant Association showed that in 2005, the average household expenditure for restaurant food was 1,054 dollars per person. These numbers make owning a restaurant a good business opportunity for aspiring food-service entrepreneurs, even during economic slowdowns and when consumer prices are rising. entrepreneurs, even during economic slowdowns and when consumer prices are rising. On the other hand, the restaurant industry has always been among the most competitive and challenging ones to navigate through, and failures are nothing new. However, the struggles have left some wondering what is behind the phenomena of restaurant closing. Nonetheless, there have been many articles talking about the determining factors of businesses' success, though not much has been done on researching why businesses fail. Therefore the result of this paper, can be studied by many restaurants in how to prevent their business from closing. "

    "In my project, I will use the Yelp's dataset that contains text reviews for restaurants in America. The first step is filtering the raw reviews from Yelp so that we only analyze reviews within our matter of interest. Secondly, I will use topic modeling to identify features of the reviews that customers have expressed their opinions on. Thirdly, once I figure out several important topics, I will collect those review texts that relate to these topics.  Fourthly, for all sentences under one feature, I will calculate a sentiment score. NLTK has some built-in utilities for doing sentiment analysis. For this task, I intend to use their sentiment analyzer function to calculate the score.  Last but not least, I will produce a summary using the discovered information, then I intend fit a Generalized Linear Model (a logistic regression) to my outputted scores, with features discovered by step 2 as explanatory variables and whether the restaurant close or not (open = 1, close = 0) as the response variables.

First of all it is because Yelp is originated from America and therefore american restaurants have the highest weight in terms of number in Yelp. Second of all, culture is such a big thing when doing text analysis. Without enough information and knowledge to take culture into account, I will just use this sub dataset for the ease of my research. In the future, however, after more tools regarding cultural effects are generated, I will definately scale up my sample by including restaurants from all around the world, in order to do a more thorough analysis on restaurant closing.

And once I figure out several important topics, I will collect those review texts that only relate to these topics, and have them create subsamples of my corpus.In addition, as I tested from last few weeks, since there are many sub or nested topics within my text reviews, I will use hierarchical clustering, intead of flat clustering to break the corpus into discrete document chunks.

This data is the result of a content analytic / content extraction study in which Andrey Rzhetsky and colleagues from the National Library of Medicine, published [here](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000391) in [PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/), gave eight annotators 10,000 sentence chunks from biomedical text in biomedical abstracts and articles, then asked them, in a loop design schematically illustrated below that provided 3 independent codings for each document. The sampling strategy pursued diversity by drawing from PubMed abstracts (1000) and full-text articles (9000: 20% from abstracts, 10% from introductions, 20% from methods, 25% from results, and 25% from discussions.) The dataset extract here involves respondents codes for sentences in terms of their *Evidence*: {0, 1, 2, 3, -1} where 0 is the complete lack of evidence, 3 is direct evidence present within the sentence, and -1 is didn't respond. (They also crowdsourced and analyzed *polarity*, *certainty*, and *number*). For example, consider the following two abutting sentence chunks: *\"Because null mutations in toxR and toxT abolish CT and TcpA expression in the El Tor biotype and also attenuate virulence...\"* [i.e., average certainty = 0], *\"...it is likely that the ToxR regulon has functional similarities between the two biotypes despite the clear differences in the inducing parameters observed in vitro\"* [i.e., average certainty = 1].\""
