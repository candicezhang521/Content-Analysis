--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	Good quality Chinese food.  Decor is nice for a Chinese restaurant.  The BBQ pork is probably the best in the city.  Served hot, it's very flavorful and moist.  The other dishes do not disappoint either.  The stirfries are all good with a good "wok hay".  Food is always hot and fresh and service is good.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	If you're a true Chinese food enthusiast, you'll need to visit this restaurant.  It's not your typical $5/plate restaurants. Plate averages $15+, but the quality and variety they offer are excellent (ie. bitter melon with dried scallop scrambled egg....nom...).  \n\nThe service on the other hand will need much improvement.  So usually I just come for take out to avoid the grumpy faces :)
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	Six dollars combo include free soup and one main course. Wesley and Brian's dish look better than mine.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	The BBQ meats here are the only items I find excellent. Served hot, the meat was succulent, especially my favourite BBQ pork. The BBQ pork is a perfect balance of sweet and savoury. The soybeans underneath were an extra treat. They were sweet and so flavourful that I could have had them on their own.\n\nThe items on the main menu are fairly pricey. While the food is certainly satisfying, I wouldn't consider the price point proportional to the taste. They do have a special menu (all in Chinese) with smaller dishes that are all $7.99 that my family usually orders from. It allows us to have a variety of dishes without breaking the bank. Beef with bitter melon is a simple dish, but one of our favourites here. The size of the dishes are smaller of course, but the quality doesn't differ too much from the main menu. \n\nWhat really detracts from this establishment is the service. Having eaten at more than my fair share of Chinese restaurants, I do not expect extremely attentive service (nor do I really desire it), but the service during my previous visit was borderline rude. One of the servers walked away when she saw us come in, and brusquely commanded a co-worker to seat us. When we ordered our food, the server asked condescendingly if all the dishes we ordered were from the special menu. The complimentary desserts (yes, I know it's complimentary but still) were put onto our table while we were still a considerable ways from finishing dinner. \n\nPerhaps I'm being a bit dramatic, but considering the fact that this is not your average Chinese restaurant, I did hold a slightly higher standard. They are also capable of exceptional service, as evidenced by my first visit, when I was with a larger party and ordering more expensive dishes. The difference in service was also noticeable during my last visit, when there was one party holding a feast in the adjacent room. It's understandable that close friends or VIPs are treated extra special, but that's no excuse for being ill-mannered to the average patron.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	If you want a quick fix for a scrumptious char siu or chinese pork bbq, this is theeee place.  Hot and fresh, nicely charred and crunchy on the outside, and loaded with flavor.  The soy-ed & sweet beans in which it bathes its tender juicy meat gives this dish the best taste everyone will keep talking about and crave for - I know because we do!  ;-)\n\nThey offer other great dishes too and its delicious!  2 setbacks though: more pricey for the same items we can find elsewhere, and the serving size a disappointment.  Another unfashionable thing is the Cash Only.  \n\nIt has never been too busy in all the lunch hours we went there but their take-outs are quite busy.  This is also a very family friendly restaurant so we gladly bring our little ones along.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	The bbq pork is very juicy and I only come here for that. The price is a tad bit on the higher end and portion is small. Everything else is average...servers are consist of two chubby sister whom I believe are also owners, a grandmother standing near the kitchen to pass on the food and two older men server. I personally don't like the owners that much. They seem rude and greedy at times. They seem to favor big crowds which equals to more $$$ and ignore the smaller group.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	My family has been taking me to this restaurant once in a while over the last 15 years and we saw the growth from one tiny restaurant to expanding it by buying the adjacent store and joining them to expand the floor area.\n\nTheir lunch menu is $7.50 per dish. We had the stir-fried rice noodle with beef and it was delicious. This restaurant prides itself in serving quality dishes and it didn't disappoint me. The award-winning char-siu is cooked when ordered. While it will take time for the dish to be served, this guaranteed its freshness
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	This restaurant is famous for their BBQ dishes and they are actually very good. It also has a variety of other non-BBQ dishes. Compare to other places that sell BBQ dishes, this restaurant is a bit pricey but their dishes are pretty good.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	Johns Chinese BBQ ruined Char Siu Pork for me.. Forever. I cannot eat it at dim sum, or a Chinese food court, or anywhere for that matter, without thinking about John's Char Siu.\n\nI discovered this place through Nick Liu of DaiLO. He took his team here for staff meal, and he claimed the Char Siu Pork was the best in the GTA. I took his word for it and made the HWY 7 trek out to Richmond Hill on a snowy day\n\n$8.50 gets you a decent portion of char siu bbq porn sliced on top of rice and topped with the light gravy. The pork is smoky, sweet, moist, cooked perfectly, and succulent.\n\nThere is not much left to say either than come here and try the pork.\n\n**Minus one start for unfriendly service, as noted by other Yelp reviewers. The lady at the cash knows she has the real deal char siu, and she DGAF about anybody.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	The incredibly rude woman behind the cashier whom I assume owns the restaurant (since she does not wear a uniform) left a bad taste in my mouth. Her demeaning attitude spoiled the taste of their food afterwards for me and I can't help but think it's because of my race due to the different way in which she treated other customers.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	Best tasting BBQ pork in the region! I started coming here 10 years ago after my colleagues recommended it.  We still pick up pork here for my family even though I've converted to a meat free diet 4 years ago.  But my family members always say this place is still their top choice
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	Wow, what a jerk! I don't write terrible reviews but this one is a piece of work. I ordered takeout from them and they skipped the soup because I am not a regular. I asked my friend later and apparently they only give you soup when you ask them after you realize you got ripped off. They are gambling on the idea that you will forget. How cheap can they get? They already charge me 9 bucks for just a small  dish. Never going there again. Will not recommend to friends. Terrible way to do business and very disappointed.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	In the ultra competitive Chinese restaurant industry of Richmond Hill, what can you do to make your restaurant stand out?  Decor/interior is one thing for sure.  But a more obvious thing is to offer some value in the food you serve.\n\nBy 'value' I am talking about bang-for-your-buck.  How delicious is it for the amount of money you pay?  How much food is served for the amount of money you pay?  If you are served a truly flavourful and succulent dish that is enough to share between 3-4 adults at a price that remains competitive, that is true value.\n\nJohn's Chinese BBQ Restaurant is nicely renovated since the old school days.  However, the rest is downhill from there.\n\n1.  Food - aside from the noodles in soup, everything else is ultra ultra expensive - so expensive, in fact, that one can't help be insulted at the audacity of the owners to set such a high price for what is being served and "how" it's being served.\n\nExample:  snow pea leaves with garlic = $16 + taxes.  What the...are we in Hong Kong?  $16 for snow pea leaves!?  Lobster = $20 + taxes for 1 small lobster;  Beef with 2 kinds of mushrooms = $15; Fried Grouper with pepper and salt = $12.\n\n2.  Service - terrible.  For the prices this place charges, you'd expect exceptional, Chinese wedding banquet level service.  Expect the same unhappy faces serving you that you get from a joint like Richmond Court.  The owners/management were too busy stuffing their own faces to fetch our tea - even when asked.  And when we got up to leave, that was the ONLY time one of the owners/management ran over to "check" our payment.  Yup, Chinese service at best.  Unbelievable.\n\nIn summary:  this place does not serve food better than any other place for any of the dishes they have on the menu.\nAnd considering the prices set for what you get, it's blatant robbery at best.  DO NOT GO HERE.  How this place managed to stay in business is beyond me.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	Went there yesterday at around 5. Me and a friend ordered two combos of chicken with BBQ pork. While we waited for the meat to be cut up the owner lady yelled at us demanding we pay up... ok there's your $18.10. Me and the friend the decided we want to eat our food there instead of taking out so we proceeded to sit down. And the wham! The unexpected happens. The owner  "invited" us  to leave saying we can't eat there because we ordered take out. Wow the place was pretty dead at the time other than two employees staring at each other. What a shitass experience. And turns out their take out combo portion was the smallest I have ever seen. For 18 bucks we got 2 small pieces of chicken together not even bigger than a regular sized thigh from Popeyes. And the two fried egg sized BBQ pork were soo dry and tasteless. Never going back again
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	Chinese name of this place, Canto pronounciation, Dsui Heung Yuen Hoi Seen Siu Lap Dsou Ga.\n\nTraditional characters can be seen on this e-businesscard link\n\nhttp://www.wjbusiness.com/wjb_Toronto/24135570.htm\n\nToo bad they picked a lackluster English name, but don't let that fool you one bit, this place is SUPERBLY AUTHENTIC and assuming quality has not changed since 2003, they will always be a classy 5 star meat joint (attitude wise) operating in a simple scaled down interior, where the food really shines and speaks for itself, while dishing out the absolute best of the best of Cantonese style roast beasts and BBQ you will ever sink your jaws into.\n\nI'm biased because this place is grandma's favorite, who used to live right across the street, and came here a lot with family (local and visiting) to the point they know her by name and automatically serve up the complementary slow fire cooked soup of the day (and at times even giving containers of soup for her to last a few days when she's by herself).\n\nAnd to top it off, when we touched down in Toronto August 2003, an hour after getting out of the airport was when the whole NE grid of North America suffered a provincial wide power outtage, Radiohead was forced to cancel their 8/15/03 original date at the Molson Amphitheater (and I had a ticket to it and couldn't make the rescheduled Air Canada Center date in October), John's came to the rescue by setting aside portions of dinner and the finest roast beasts JUST FOR US to go, including soup, while they reduced kitchen operations to portable gas stoves and take out, so we wouldn't be savoring instant noodles or canned goods during the outtage. Now THAT is class.\n\nOne of the key reasons for their five star award, is for John's nailing down and doing the DEFINITIVE preparation of what is translated to be "princess chicken", sometimes casually translated to "yellow fur chicken", or Gwai Fei Gai. Old schoolers also know this to be Bak Cheet Gai. Basically a steamed or poached chicken that if done right, is superbly fragrant on its own from the marination and prep, surpassing the best Singaporean style Hainan Chicken even (yes, and please don't gasp in horror that I said that) and then all you need is some shizzletastic sauce called ginger & scallion oil to dip in, a bowl of rice, and suddenly you be da King eating out the Princess (chicken that is, sorry that sounded royally rawng). \n\nEvery table at John's has a sheet describing in painful detail (in Chinese) how each Princess Chicken is made, and the amount of seasoning, Chinese herbs, and the whole process itself, is a legend and probably deserves its own Yelp review. You would be amazed to learn how extremely laborious in nature it is to make a Princess from scratch, and yet it is so affordable and luxurious in taste. Sadly I misplaced that sheet of paper, and my AZN character typing skills aren't up to par, so we will have to revisit the gorey details some other time.\n\nBut trust me, this is the bestest, sexiest Princess you will ever have in your life, tender suckalicious breasts and juiciest thighs. Most of the time the breasts end up being too dry, but John knows how to prep her to make you weep. The last time I had princess this good was at an old restaurant in Wanchai Hong Kong (Tso's) that is no longer around, back in the 80s.\n\nRoast duck here is also sexcellent and I'll bet they have roast goose as well (where it is not illegal unlike south of the border). Of course one cannot miss the cha shiu here as it is pure porkgasm.\n\nI can't wait to come back to John's again, and literally be a King at the table of roast beasts and princesses.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	This place is a favourite lunch spot for my family for years and years. We usually get combo a or b; which comes with a fried rice/noodle; a dish of old water tofu( this is one of my favourite places for this dish); roast duck congee and two kind of BBQ meat combo. This usually comes out to about $30 total for 4 people - and there is more than enough food. \n\nDinner is ok too - although if you can't read Chinese - you are pretty much limited to what is printed on their bi-lingual menu and you do miss out on quite a lot of their other dishes - and they have well over 30 different dishes to try - one of my favourites is their scrambled egg and shrimp dish - their eggs are just fluffy enough and done just right.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	Roasted pork is one of my favorite things... And we pay a premium for the meat around the ribs and the belly area because of the wonderful marbling...  beautiful layer after layer of alternating meat and fat.  My wife bought some from John's today... paid a premium for this "cut" and when I opened up the box it was all meaty pieces without marbling... Very disappointed.  The flavour was decent but not the cut we paid for.  Probably best to keep going to the BBQ place at Valleymede and HWY 7 (north side) in the plaza with McDees.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	We, party of 4, were very sceptical coming in here for lunch. There are so many good Chinese restaurants on Highway 7, what makes this one so special?  Well...this place has,in my opinion, the best roast pork and bbq pork on Highway 7. The skin is very crispy and there isn't a lot of fat. The beans around it just compliments the dish. The bbq pork is also very tasty and their awards on the wall is no lie. Vegetables we order is very tender and the curry beef dish is delicious!!!!  The servers here are polite, attentive and very helpful.\n\nIn retrospect, we will definitely come back for more roast pork and bbq pork. Next time will try their dinner service.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	I find myself here time and time again with the family. They're well known for the bbq pork, which sells out quite fast! Best thing to do is to call ahead and order it first, then when you come in for your meal, you'll know you got it.\n\nI love their soup of the day. They come in the same size bowl no matter how large your party is, so if you're just 2 people, you'll get plenty. On the flip side, if you come in with 6 people, don't be afraid to ask for more.\n\nMy favourite dishes are the bbq pork, the scrambled eggs with shrimp, and the minced pork pancake. These dishes make me chow down on rice like nothing else, and makes for good nommy times. \n\nI personally find nothing lacking in the service - I don't expect a shining example of stellar service at the typical Chinese restaurant, but perhaps the fact that my family is here every week helps?
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	The char siu is pretty tasty here, but was lacking the fattiness and moisture that I've come to enjoy about good Chinese BBQ pork. The roast duck was excellent with crispy skin and lots of tender meat. The duck was definitely the star of the show in my experience. Somewhere I'd definitely return to for some good Chinese BBQ.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	Decent food for decent price.  \nThis is a standard Chinese BBQ restaurant. Nothing great but nothing bad about the place. It's a good standard if you're in the area. I do notice that I'm overly thirsty when eating their food so it tells me they don't use as much MSG as other places which is good in my books.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	Great selection of authentic Chinese dishes. The made-to-order goo lo yuk (sweet and sour pork) was well worth the wait.  The honey deep fried oysters and bbq pork were excellent too.  Will visit again for sure!
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	John's Chinese BBQ Restaurant is one of those restaurants that you will feel so out of place if you come as a couple or don't even think about it alone! \n\nWhy so?? There are no small tables... the smallest one is the one that you can sit 4 people comfortably.... I guess when it is busy, singles are expect to share tables with others?\n\nLunch specials does have a separate menu that is under $10 that includes 1 entrees that you can choose for, a soup and a rice.. not too bad.\n\nSui Kow Noodles (Shrimp Dumplings with Noodle Soup) $5.00\n- The dumplings according to the waiter was freshly prepared... better be since I wait and wait and wait for 15 minutes for my order to come and I am the only person in the restaurant\n- shrimp dumplings really small... has 2 small shrimps inside and some pork... not bad.. but disappointing small\n- Store bought noodle is A-OK.. not overcooked so not soggy.. and have a chew on it\n- Suggestion: need to have some chives or green onion as garnish... look at my boring yellowish photos... everything are yellowish...even the soup itself... little garnish not only improve presentation but also the taste!\n\nAdvice:\n- don't come to dine in if you are alone.. take out a BBQ lunch box will be your best bet...\n- don't come even for lunch if there is an important Chinese holiday like First Day of Winter... the staffs will be so busy taking phones reservations and prep for the busy dinning hours then taking care of you.. and you will find you eating in the middle of a war zone (staffs yelling at each other, tables moves around... ) and you will not have a nice and peaceful lunch even if the place is empty!\n\nCash Only!
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	i like humble-pie.\nbut the owner walks around with a blown-up, laminated newspaper  article proclaiming his famous bbq pork - like the proud mother of chess playing Wav-A-Lee in Joy Luck Club.\nhad he not, perhaps i might have thought, 'hey, this is different. check out the beans beneath. almost caramelized. sweet, but appropriate under the savoury-sweet pork. almost unique.'\nexcept! it just so happens that i've had similar while dining with my dad (who really, really knows his BBQ pork) and he wouldn't let me touch the stuff due to the "marbling" clumps of fat. call it father-daughter love, but i trust him and what I see. there's a very good reason to serve this stuff warm, lest one chew into a white congealed glob of white lard. \ncheap pork fat = fine. \nexpensive skill = fine.\ni dislike pricey pork fat and those who brag about it.\n\nif it's possible (i'm really not sure) ask for a lean cut. if it's available, i promise it won't be as tender and tasty, but your heart will thank you!\n\ntip: before reheating a chilled doggy-bag, peer inside to witness the white stuff sticking to your veins. to bring to temp, try steaming or spraying with a bit of water if nuking.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	Expensive...?\n\nI've never been to a place where the average dish for dinner is $8. That's right: 8 DOLLARS. Okay fine, the portions are smaller than usual, but still, 8 dollars?!\n\nThe specialty, of course, is their BBQ Pork. Unfortunately, two people in my household can not eat pork, so we had to skip on that. I did hear it's great though, and will probably try some other time.\n\nWhat did not cost 8 dollars, and probably should have, was their shark fin rice mixed with some sort of soup, which cost $19. There was certainly a lot of rice and soup, but the shark fin lacked extremely.\n\nAlthough since the bill came out to $72 for a table of 5 with the rice (so $53 without), I can't really complain...except maybe the shoddy service we got.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	I come here with my gf and her family often and they never disappoint.  The food is always served fresh and with typical Chinese restaurants the service is sub par unless you are a regular customer.  The decor itself is your usual Chinese bbq house/restaurant and is nothing to go crazy over, but it's the food that keeps us coming back here.\n\nThe dishes we usually order and are their top of the line choices include their steamed fresh fish, minced pork meat pie, bitter melon and meat, steamed chicken and assorted styles of cooked vegetables with shrimp paste.  The food is served fresh and hot and always comes out quickly.  \n\nThe take out and bbq to order is also very delicious and you'll have to get there early if you want the famous bbq pork or duck.  Make sure to call in advance if you want to book a table on a busy day or are looking for a special dish!
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	They have the best Chinese BBQ Pork (Char Siu) in town, and they called it Char Siu Wong (King of Chinese BBQ Pork).  Hmm... It's pretty true!  I've to pre-order this dish every single time, cuz it's always sold out.\n\nOther dishes are very good too, like Roast Pork, Fried Glutinous Rice, Steamed Fish, etc.\n\nI can't stop myself for coming back when I'm craving for Siu Mei
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	Of the 6 Cantonese BBQ places I have tried in GTA, this one is by far the best of all.  If one wants to get a comparison since Cantonese BBQ has different styles, I would point to Big Wong BBQ off Mott Street in NY during the 90's (it's different now compared to back then).\n\nMy favorite:  their crispy skin pork and char siu (red roast pork).  The crispy skin is not just crispy, it breaks up in a crunch fluffy kind of way, with the layer of fat soften to the point of near melting point but still there, and the meat is moistened perfectly.  Now bear in mind:  you need to make sure you get there earlier vs later (after 2 pm) when the meat is very fresh to achieve this desirable effect on the taste buds.  And always try and get the part of pig near the kidney area for the most tender juicy flavors.\n\nAbout some of the other Yelpers complain on service and higher price:  seems kind of trivial to me personally.  The slightly higher price simply reflects the higher quality (which naturally takes more labor to produce right?) of the BBQ offerings.  More labor, more time means more money/costs.  As for service:  I was polite and the lady cashier was very polite.  I would guess the younglings on Yelp were less than courteous, and in response and fairness, received the same type of indifference from the cashier.  Old saying:  Don't do unto others you wouldn't want done to you.....
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	I came here late for dinner with my family, and they just ran out of the roast pork that we wanted to order (also the main reason we wanted to go to this place). We decided to come back the next day for dinner instead, and we were able to reserve an order of roast pork and a whole roast duck to make sure the same thing wouldn't happen to us again. This required a $50 payment in advance.\n\nThe roast pork was amazing. The meat was tender with just the right amount of fat, but certain pieces of the meat were a little too burnt. The bbq honey sauce they used on the pork was really good.. It had the perfect consistency and flavor. There was also a small layer of beans hiding under the meat.. I was a little surprised to see this, but it actually worked. The roast duck was excellent as well. The skin was crispy, and the meat was very juicy. I didn't eat too much of the steamed fish, but it was pretty good from what I tried. The veggies we ordered were about as good as I expected them to be.\n\nThey clearly use high quality ingredients here, but the prices still seem too high overall. If I lived in the area, I would only come here once in a while because of that. Still, even with the high prices, I think that everyone should try this restaurant at least once because of their delicious roast pork.. It is honestly among the best I've ever had.
--6MefnULPED_I942VcFNA	I came here to order a roast duck over rice to go because there isn't a whole lot of restaurants to choose from that is within walking distance from where I was staying. Plus it was just for myself so no need to be all fancy with a sit-down meal. It costed me over $9! I was taken aback considering it was not only overpriced, but it does not come with a side of veggies nor complimentary soup like I am used to at pretty much every other Chinese BBQ places I've been to. It does come with a ton of rice that can feed a village and the roast duck itself was pretty good. Either way, I wouldn't come back.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Last week, I attended an event that I'll never forget!! Primal hosted their weekly Thursday night run, but with some subtle additions. They had an event hosted by Saucony & Black Men Run. It was epic. From the new beers, to the new buddies it was a great night. And I managed to rock the trails faster than anyone else there. Needless to say, my return to this event can't come soon enough
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	I'll be honest, I don't get a chance to venture out to Huntersville very often. I had a baby shower up this way on Saturday, so a bunch of us decided to meet the daddy to be and some friends here post pregnancy party.\n\nPrimal kinds of feels like being inside a house. I think someone else nailed it by using the word ski lodge. There's a little bar area, a fireplaces, couches... it's pretty cozy. A nice little brewery in the 'burbs.\n\nThe six of us scoped out the chalkboard menu and claimed a little high top table as our home base. I am by no means a beer expert, snob, or connoisseur. I tried a couple different beers and liked them both. One was a ginger something and the other lemon haze. While trying to look up the beer names on Facebook, I saw on their page how they just did a soup kitchen takeover and fed over 200 people in need. Very cool! \n\nNon-beer drinkers, they do have wine and little bottles of champagne. Check their pages for updates on live music, food trucks, and other events. If you don't live up in this area, I would recommend making a day of it and hit all these breweries up here (Primal, Ass Clown, D9, Bayne). Just make sure to have safe ride!
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Love this place.  Second time there, and loved it even more!  I always ask, "what beers are new, and what's the most popular." The bar tender was excited that her Primal Fest (fall seasonal) beer is back.   She even gave us a sample. Needless to say I loved it and got a glass of it. \n\nThe Primal Fest is so good.  Had a nice Amber color, and all the flavors were great.  The initial taste all the way to the after taste was spot on. Not one part of the tasting process did I not enjoy. I definitely want to get a growler full!\n\nThe decor of the place is so chill, they have a bar, high top chairs and tables, and leather lounge chairs for a more relaxing setting. \n\nAlso I love it when breweries have "activities". They have corn hole, life size Jenga, and shut the box!  Which is very addicting and your friends will love it! \nWe never heard of it before, but heard it's a popular southern game. I see why! Something small like having games or activities will help keep people engaged, and that means more beer sales since they are staying at the brewery.\n\nWe spent about 30 minutes at Crafty Beer Guys, had one beer and then went to Primal. Where we spent nearly 2 hours because we played games, which kept us buying more beer. Also unlike Crafty Beer Guys (2 miles up the road), Primal sells flights, which is a great start to try new beers before you pick a random one. \n\nI also love when breweries have stickers.  Something small, but the extra added touch is great. And it's great marketing for them.  Especially for us since we put the stickers on our cooler that we take to tailgate. \n\nIn conclusion, I will TOTALLY be back.  Love this place. A good tip is to try the Harry Porter beer. A nice spin on Harry Potter, but it tastes good! Can't wait to go back!
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Wanted to sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather but music was so loud we had to leave. We could not talk to each other. Very unpleasant experience.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	My husband and I took our friend here and we had the best time. The bartender was very friendly and knowledgeable about the beers they had on tap.\n\nThey offer 4,5 or 6 flights which is helpful since they have a lot of beer to try! We loved the primal fest and they also have a very good red ale'\n\nThere are plenty of seats, indoors and outside with both games for any section you sit in! Life size jenga, shut the box and corn hole.\n\nIt was a rainy day when we went and what I loved about this visit was that there was a local farmer that set up a stand inside to sell his produce!\n\nWe got a fresh eggplant and 3 tomatoes! I asked him if he is always there on Sunday's ( yes primal is open on Sunday's!!) and he was there that day due to the crazy rain. It was nice to see this local brewery support a local farmer!!
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Visited for their Lake Street Dive concert - beers were OK, the lemon in particular was good.  Won't be returning - didn't think a 10 ounce pour should be $5 at the brewery. Additionally, $10 for parking was excessive.  Felt like they were price gouging the customers at every opportunity.  For a better experience, check music calendar at Pisgah Brewery in Black Mountain - where a $5 pour is a full pint glass of much better beer.  Oh, and free parking there too.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	I like the atmosphere at this brewery a lot.  The staff is always very nice and helpful with beer choices.  It is very cozy in the fall and winter, as they have a delightful fireplace and sitting area.  It's always clean and tidy.  The beers on tap constantly rotate and many of them are pretty good.  In the summer, it can get really crowded and hot inside! They offer a patio in case you would like to step out for some air.  There are often a few food trucks present, which is a nice added touch.  There is also a large private parking lot which is easy to come in and out of, huge plus!
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	I've been meaning to write a review for this place for a while but now seems fitting. We have been to Primal about 5 times now. We find the atmosphere great and the staff open to talk about their brewery and beers. There beer is good quality and a nice variety for the handful they'll have on tap. I like the Sweet Lou, be sure to ask a brewer about it.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Great place to visit when North of Charlotte.  Beautiful outside seating with, of course, cornhole. Inside, decent bar seating, nooks with couches and a fire place for those cold days.  \n\nBrews are artfully displayed above the taps.  Jay was great and engaged all customers, young and old.  He made sure all were taken care of and answered questions about beer.  \n\nFor larger groups, they are allowed to serve two flights of six....see pic.  Which is epic to behold.  This way all beers can be sampled and a pint of your favorite ordered next.  None of the beers really stuck out to me or the hubby; however, they are decent beers with a large variety, which is nice.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	This is an awesome brewery. The inside is very nicely done and is a great place to relax, and the beer has been fantastic. I highly recommend to anyone.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Primal promoted a concert by Lake Street Dive (only band named and promoted) today with gates opening at 2pm and show starting at 4pm. I get forwarded an email late yesterday that Lake Street Dive isn't really playing until 8:30pm. That is deceptive marketing.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Primal Brewing is a bit of a drive but well worth the trip, especially if you combine it with a trip to some of the breweries in Cornelius. When you pull up, the lot looks very small, but the gravel lot directly to the right is for overflow. Out front there are several shaded picnic tables.\n\nThe Brewery and Taproom itself are on the small side, but this is a nano brewery. There's fairly limited seating other than the bar, but what there is, is comfortable; lounge chairs and sofas.\n\nNow the important part, the beer.\n\nI was pretty impressed with the new kid on the block. The Grim Creeper Imperial IPA was well balanced and smooth for a high ABV beer. My next favorites were a tie between Devil's Gas Pumpernickel Rye IPA (robust and malty with lots of depth) and Not So Harry Porter (no trying to be fancy, just an easy drinking well rounded porter). Hazelnut Stout gets an honorable mention.\n\nNice job lads and ladies!!!
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	I dropped into this cool little brewery after a late-day meeting in Huntersville, and was instantly impressed by the ambiance, the service, and the modest selection of munchies (pretzels, popcorn and OMG, COLD CUTS!). Oh, and the beer's pretty good, too. At least, the Centennial IPA I tried was.\n\nWith ample indoor and outdoor seating, a firepit and indoor fireplace, this feels like combination Man Cave and Brewpub. A few more TVs would help, but the lack of ESPN screaming at you in the background means you can sit quietly by the fire and contemplate your beer. And when the beer's this good, that's a pretty smart call.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Finally a neighborhood joint I can get excited about,  If and when you pass by Primal do not be afraid, pull in and grab a pint! I really like the Ethel red ale and the Lemon Haze. I recommend trying the sampler so you can then decide which one you like then buy several! The wait to buy is a little long which says a lot of its popularity. \nThey have outdoor seating but it was way too hot to be outside.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	I stopped by Primal Brewery to grab a growler of fresh brew for the weekend. I believe it was only the second day they were open, so some of the negative impressions I got may be corrected soon enough.\n\nThe space itself is really nice. It has the feel of a cozy ski lodge with lots of exposed wood, a fireplace, and several small tables and chairs throughout. \n\nThe service was friendly and fast with some understandable hiccups given that it was the second day in business. For example, they ran out of two of the five beers, and no one seemed to know how much to charge for a growler fill. In the end, though, I was given a full growler for a fair price.\n\nSadly, however, the beer I purchased was not so good. I'm not connoisseur, but this pale ale just didn't satisfy, and was even sort of a challenge to get through. But it was beer, after all, so I finished it.\n\nI'll definitely give them another shot, but I'm hoping the next couple of beer styles I try there are much better than the first. It would be a shame if the closest brewery to my house turns out to be a dud...
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Extremely mediocre at best. Visited Primal Brewery (PB) during the week thanks to a work-sponsored happy hour. When I pulled upon the PB sign, I drove into an unmarked gravel parking lot. However, I turned around and saw the PB parking lot sign so I drove around and parked in their own graveled lot.\n\nWhen I entered, I was struck by the cabin-in-the-woods feel. There's wood everywhere. Also, they don't seem to have a fully functioning A/C. This was a hot, July evening and the inside was stuffy, to say the least. \n\nI wasn't in the mood for beer, so I was very appreciative that they had a wine list. I ordered a glass of Riesling which ended up being just as clear as tap water poured in a wine glass. Thanks to my coworkers, I was able to sample everyone's beer selection. The peach flavored beer (I forget the actual name) was not a favorite, the saison was good, and the lemon flavored beer was a little bit of a letdown as well.\n\nThey have a food truck on site, Lake Norman Grill, that serves a limited menu of hamburgers, hot dogs, fried pickles, fried mac & cheese bites, pretzels, etc. I ordered fried pickles and was given a buzzer to wait for my food. Once my buzzer beeped, I picked up my food and brought in to share with my table. Completely underwhelming.\n\nAlso, while at PB, I went to the bathroom. HUGE negative that they have only ONE stall/toilet for ladies. Why is this a thing?! \n\nI'm very thankful for the fact that my job paid for the beverages because I cannot see myself going back to PB to pay for a drink.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Great beer, great place, excellent service from the women.....but especially the bearded guy!
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Honestly, I don't really go out to breweries that often. i'm not crazy into the craft beers and all the cool things the kids are into. BUT. I love Primal! We've been wanting to stop by and see what it's like and I'm so glad we did. The inside looks so much like a home, and you just want to stay there all night and drink.\n\nThere's cute couches inside with board games around the room. The bar area is cute but also spacious. Of course, there's corn hole outside, along with plenty of picnic bench seating. It's dog friendly. The beers are fantastic. The service is good. There's a popcorn machine inside and they have small snacks if you get the munchies.\n\nThere's really not too much else to say about Primal Brewery. I'm into it. We have a new thing going, and I like it.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	I'm from Beer City USA, so kind of picky. The beer was wonderful, the food truck had great food, the atmosphere really pulled it all together.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	On a recent tour of Lake Norman area breweries, Primal was our first (and favorite) stop along I-77. I liked the tap room -- it felt like hanging out in someone's swanky mountain house living room. As for beers, I enjoyed my Lucille Red Ale and Not so Harry Porter. The names made me chuckle. They were in a line up with the likes of Devils Gas, Grim Creeper and Cravens Elixir. Someone has a sense of humor! \n\nWhile I really liked my beers, for the sake of full disclosure, Ted wasn't crazy about the IPAs he tried. I think he'd probably give them 3 or 4 stars. But, since I'm the one assigning stars, I'm giving 5. ;) \n\nI hate we're not in Cornelius more often. If Primal was a little closer to home, I think we'd be regulars. I'll just settle for hunting them down at beer fests and stopping before/after lake days!
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Meh- it's ok I guess. Huge outdoor seating- fireplace indoors- popcorn available- also serving wine and mimosas. Nice layout but minimal beer to offer. There was no food truck when we were there but it was raining.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Beyond excellent beer. Jay,  working the bar, was one of the few bartenders (who after only serving me 1 drink)  was able to know what my next beer was (as I was already deciding mentally), before I even ordered.  I  had a sample of the exact beer I was contemplating ordering,  before I had finished my first. I've never had a more perceptive bartender. The bar was pretty packed for what I'd expect from a Sunday evening (only two seats empty at the bar,  and quite a few occupied tables). I plan on returning on any future trips to this area.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	I'm a tad reluctant to write a review as I run the risk of spoiling one of the things I love about the place, it has just the right amount of 'busy'.  Staff are awesome, and care that you have a great experience.  Outside patio is a wonderful.  It's the dogs bollocks.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	I recently made the road trip to this area to visit the breweries. I've been to D9 and Ass Clown just down the road, but never made it to Primal. Boy, that was a mistake. Primal had great beer, they had freshly popped Popcorn, and they serve wine. The inside Tap room is laid out well with plenty of seating, some open room, and several nooks for more private areas. The outside area is large, but is right next to the road, which can be a little noisy. But as usual, my brewery experience revolves around the beer. They had a wide selection with multiple IPA's. I only tried 1, which was really good. Another great brewery to add to the list, and if you in this area, I would rank it first, though Ass Clown and D9 are also very good.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	The beer is horrible and dave doesn't know the difference between a cat and a dog.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	It's been a while since I was a beer snob (also coffee and whisky variously) so I don't get excited much about 'dark water' but the establishments that serve it are sometimes noteworthy. Primal has the perfect location, right about the time I've had my fill of sitting still in traffic there's the option of sitting at a bar. Primal has been comfortable during my few visits, patrons and servers alike, the main room has the feel of a hill-country lodge, out front there's a few umbrella-ed tables and a slew of full-sun seats over by the food truck/corn hole arena if you're so inclined.\nI wouldn't try to offer a meaningful comment about weekend, lunch, or evening experience but others will have covered all that. The day time help Lauren is a good kid, knows what's on tap and can help you make wise choices if you're willing to help, otherwise you can work your way down the handles: saison, lawn boy, raspberry something... Word of caution though: seems there's some sort of rotation with the offerings on tap so unless you are pretty regular you may miss one or double up.\nBTW: Best thing about running a tab during a tornado warning; if the really bad thing happens your beer was free...
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Primal Brewery is a quaint and small place up in Huntersville/Cornelius. It is one of my personal favorites in the area along with Ass Clown. It's also conveniently located not far up the same road from Crafty Beer Guys where you can find some of Primal's and other local breweries on tap.\n\nBack at Primal you can find a well varied selection of staple brews and the occasional small batch. Prices are about as to be expected from breweries in the area. Lawn Boy is about as close to basic American beer as they come - but with far more character. The hazelnutty goodness of Mother of Human Kindness is a stout made for the cold months. And my personal favorite would have to be the Lucille red ale. (I took a half-growler of it home on my last visit.)\n\nThe folks working here are fairly friendly and easygoing, as is the crowd. It also doesn't get too crowded. Nowadays they have the almost requisite food truck parked outside. But if you're just wanting a small bite they have hot pretzels and a steady flow of endless, buttery popcorn for a small fee inside. Whenever I find myself back up this way, Primal is one of the first places to come to mind.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	12 or so taps. Funky place. Bottomless popcorn for cheap. IPAs that aren't overly bitter and the majority will enjoy. You'll enjoy so much you may want a keg....we did. The pojo was what we liked and felt enough others would like to make it keg worthy. The craven was pretty similar with a different end bite, but also nearly keg worthy. Pojo took the prize tho, so all the others were very decent yet didn't make the cut. Games outside for afternoons and a good space inside to hang. Small, but homey. I'd come again for sure.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	I've been to Primal twice now. It's one of the newer breweries in the Charlotte area.\n\nThe bar is to the left as you walk in.  There are pub tables in the middle and then comfortable sofas and chairs in the two rooms off to the right. In the 2nd room on the right, there is a large fireplace. Out front there are picnic tables and there is cornhole on the left side of the building.\n\nThe beer is good here. I especially enjoy the hazelnut stout and their pale ales. \n\nWhile i enjoyed the beer and appreciate what they do, the fact that it was hot inside and loud as hell where I couldn't even hear the people I was sitting with killed it for me where I had such an odd feeling here.  The place needs more softer textures to eat the noise. \n\nSo for this review I'll leave the following ratings:\n\nStaff:  3\nAtmosphere:  2\nBeer:  4\n\nAverage:  3 stars
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Nice small place and the bartender was super friendly. Liked the decor as well. We had a flight and liked trying the different beer types. All in all a nice experience
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	The fella and I stopped by with some friends on a Saturday afternoon to check it out before dinner. I agree with the other reviewer who said it feels like a cozy ski lodge. There are maybe 8-10 seats at the bar, two 4-top tables, and the rest of the seating is comfy-looking leather chairs scattered around in conversation set-ups with some around a fireplace.\n\nWhen we got there around 3:45 pm, the clientele was significantly older and loud. By the time we left around 6:15, it was pretty much full of college kids. The acoustics were a little crummy, and coupled with a full house, made it difficult to hear the people standing right next to me.\n\nService was decent, but the fella and his friend placed a couple of orders for one beer and got a different one - made it difficult to adequately review them. I'm not a beer drinker (but they had wine, too - hooray!), but the fella said their beers were decent. He got a flight of 5, and one was pretty good, three were decent, and one was pretty crummy.\n\nOnce they get a rhythm down, I think (hope?) they'll get even better.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Great selection of beer and extremely friendly service!  There is ample seating and a cool selection of games.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Great beer selection and very friendly crew. Nice atmosphere that seems to attract happy people. I'll be back for sure!!
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Definitely can't wait to return once the weather warms up a bit because there's a great outdoor patio...Great spot off of Old Statesville. I had the pale ale which was pretty good. The inside is very clean and modern, not like some of the more rustic breweries in southend. I liked it though. Some nice sitting couches and tables, and a great bar area. We were in on a Friday night, with a pretty good crowd. There was even a food truck outside. The combo of food trucks and craft beer is such a genius one, and I respect any establishment that coordinates this!
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Great beer!   Nice selection. Relaxing atmosphere with a fire place!  We will be coming back!
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Great neighborhood brewery! Hubby and I had a Cravens IPA and their Imperial IPA ... Can't remember it's name. The imperial was our fav. We lucked up and were there on a night that they had a Food Truck...New Wrap Order. Tons of seating inside.. Tables, couches. Picnic tables, cornhole, and huge jinga game outside. Can't wait to go back!
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	This review is for Lauren!! Not only is she an awesome bartender at primal but we felt right at home upon meeting her! I personally think she's exactly what any local brewery needs! I can't fairly review the beer here as my husband is the beer drinker and my go to is wine! The wine selection is awesome for any of you who don't do beer either! Ryan (my husband) doesn't seem to LOVE the beers but did enjoy the centennial IPA!!also, amazing cozy atmosphere!! Perfect spot for a chill Saturday or weeknight drink!
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Primal Brewery is a nice place for a group that wants to hang out.  The interior has a nice appeal, where you can just kick back and relax.  FYI - no TV's for sporting events.   I have been several times when the staff have had a chili cook-off contest, which I loved!\n\nThe summer is pretty awesome as there is a large picnic area seating out front.  On weekends, one of Charlotte's food trucks is usually stationed out  front too.\n\nGood times, good beer --- life is good.....
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Great place to hang out and have a really good micro brew.  Nice selection of 12 beers with clear definition of flavor, aroma and purpose.  The staff is great, very friendly.  Both the indoor and outdoor areas are comfortable. Live Music on Saturdays is always good.  No TVs, so you will have to make friends with the people in the place, which is very easy to do.  I highly recommend Primal for a local micro brewery.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Strong beers still developing; this is a great space. Brewers are hands on and provide inside access to how they brew. Love the 60/40 split of nitrous to CO2, makes the beer smooth and easy to drink. Looking forward to seeing this space grow.
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Visited Primal for the first time on a rainy Saturday evening. Walking in there was a great cozy and intimate ambience. The inside area is somewhat small with 4-5 tables, bar seating and some areas with couches. This is a great brewery to settle in with an old friend and catch up over a few beers. There are no Tvs, games etc. so be prepared to entertain yourselves and your friends with good conversation. I loved the fresh popped popcorn that was available to curb my beer infused munchies. The popcorn and the soft pretzels offered are the extent of the food served here however food trucks have been known to frequent the parking lot. After sampling 2 beers ( I had 2 of the 3 IPAs served -- my fav ) we came to the conclusion the beer is pretty good ! One strange drawback I found was there is no printed menu; they have drawings of each of the beers above the bar but the lamps made it difficult to read and for those without great eyesight nearly impossible . Suggestion to primal - print a small menu with descriptions of the beers to make available to your guests, it would do wonders !!\nI'll definitely go back but just not on football Sunday :).
--7zmmkVg-IMGaXbuVd0SQ	Last stop for the day. I love that you have a 4, 5 or 6 flight option here. Of course I went with the 6 flight option! This flight included: MOHK, Obsidian Lager, Grim Creeper, Lemon Haze Pale Ale, Porter and Lucille Red Ale. Boyfriend and I really enjoyed the MOHK, a hazelnut stout, and Porter. My personal favorite out of the beers that we tried was the Grim Creeper but since it was so high in alcohol I went with a pint of the runner-up Lucille Red Ale. \n\nThe atmosphere was inviting, people were so friendly minus one overserved gentleman who told me he needed to go wiz then laughed about it and said I did not need to know that.. why yes, you are correct. I also really liked the fireplace and outdoor seating area.
--8LPVSo5i0Oo61X01sV9A	Dr.LaCognata did my knee replacement surgery and did a wonderful job. I would recommend him to anyone.  He did so good you could barely see my scar. He has the best bedside manner of any doctor I have  ever met. I love Dr. LaCognata.
--8LPVSo5i0Oo61X01sV9A	Dr. LaCognata is great.  He is a great listener and very down to earth for a doctor, in my experience.  I appreciated his conservative approach vs. going right to surgery.  When he does surgery, the recovery time is excellent.  I know a lot of Orthopedic Surgeons, because I work in physical therapy, and I would recommend him to my friends and family.
--8LPVSo5i0Oo61X01sV9A	Dr. Purcell is good and thorough. Their office staff is extremely questionable. They do not return calls. They do not listen to voice mails. They tell you they will "find out" but won't call you back. Their office hours are very limiting so it is difficult to re-contact them again. Do not leave a voice mail or send them a fax because they won't "receive it" or they will tell you they "are having problems with their fax machine and voice mail". Worst customer service ever! I would switch my family member to another specialist but am stuck because of the insurance issue, and they probably know that, or they just don't care about their patients and are only working for their paychecks. We are happy with the physician, but the unprofessional staff is exasperating. How difficult is it to return a phone call?
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, somewhere I know I can go and get a great steak and have a great atmosphere to share with friends or family.  I have been going to Delmonico since about four year ago and I have never been disappointed once.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this place is every time I have made a reservation I have always got seated almost exactly on time.  This place is not cheap nor is it too overpriced compared to other steakhouses in Las Vegas that don't even come close to this one.\n\nOne of my favorite things is they have an great selection of scotches and bourbon, the have a separate menu for it and if you like either please make sure and check it out.\n\nGive this place a try and know that I recommend it to everyone.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Was excited to go here since it was Emerille's Steakhouse.  We had reservations for 8PM and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. The waiter was really nice and friendly.  They brought us bread which they placed individually on our plates. I started with the spinach and arugula salad, which was super good. I was glad to have had that in my stomach, since it took a while to get our steaks.\n\nI ordered the filet, medium and a side of asparagus.  The steak was seared a little too much and tasted a little burnt.  They also topped it off with a pad of butter.  By no means was it a bad steak, but for the price, I guess I expected more.  The asparagus was good but also very buttery.  Good food, but I have definitely had better.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2012 Fall Restaurant Week Lunch #2. \n\nWhether you're visiting Delmonico on a regular night, special occasion, or during Restaurant Week as I did, from the amazing lunch I had with extraordinary service and exceptional food, I'd recommend it to anyone. 4.5 stars at least.\n\nWe seem to be the first party seated for lunch. Our two servers worked well together, being knowledgeable, catering, and attentive from beginning to end. Even as more customers started to come in and they had more to attend to, they still did an amazing job making sure we were taken care of.\n\nWhat we put in our tummies:\n(pictures posted)\n\n1st Course\nTraditional New Orleans\nChicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo\n\n2nd Course\nButternut Squash Ravioli\nPrime Cheeseburger w/ Bacon\n\n3rd Course\nEmeril's Banana Cream Pie\nPecan Pie\n\nI'm no expert on gumbo, but I found it very tasty. Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful.\n\nThe highlight of the food was unquestionably the desserts. I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie." I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting.\n\nI was beginning to wonder if the Restaurant Week event and menus were affecting my experiences at these places I've been eagerly wanting to try. I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause. \n\nPersonally, I'm very happy to say Delmonico made me want to become a repeat customer, again and again. It's so hard not to give 5 stars, but I would want to experience dining here on a non-Restaurant Week to confidently say it was as amazing as I remembered this lunch. \n\nI'm very much looking forward to coming back. And soon!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My client took me here after the MAGIC Show and it was phenomenal! The steak danced in my mouth. Well not really but you get the picture. The salads and sides (asparagus, potatoes) were excellent. They also have a fine wine selection. This place takes steak on another level! Highly recommended!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Man.. I'm drooling just thinking about the wonderful birthday meal I had here (courtesy of dearest Hubby).\n\nI loved how the theme of the restaurant was very New Orleans/Cajun inspired.\n\nBefore we even ordered, we got to try these ox tail thingies, compliments of the chef. Pretty good.\n\nWe started with the BBQ shrimp. Delish.\n\nI had the filet, and Hubby had the bone-in filet. According to him, it was extremely good, and he liked it better than the bone-in at Fleming's. I absolutely loved my filet. It had a cajun spice flavor, and it was so good that I didn't even want to dip it in Emeril's version of A1 sauce (yeah.. it's an Emeril restaurant.. didn't know that till I looked at the menu, and I admit initially I was a little turned off by that).\n\nWe shared asparagus and mushrooms as sides, and their mushrooms were superb. They didn't use the button mushrooms that most steakhouses use. Instead, I think they were shiitake mushrooms, or some sort of mushrooms that tasted similar/looked similar to shiitake mushrooms. Either way, very good.\n\nWe ended the meal with a complimentary sorbet that was yum, and we also ordered their dessert of the night, which was a blackberry cheesecake that was yum as well.\n\nLastly, according to Hubby, they had a great wine selection.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Ordered the seafood tower at $130 came with oysters on the half shell, 2 lobster tails split in half which were slightly overlooked and rubbery. A handful of shrimp which tasted farm raised and lacked a good wild shrimp taste. Tuna tartare was great and the crab legs were great.\n\nWarm wilted spinach salad ($15) came out with a deep fried soft boiled egg and bacon with candy pecans baked on it. There was spinach in there but a 2000 calorie salad isn't really that much of a salad. Still it was good.\n\nAdded to that the bone in 45 day aged ribeye ($50). That was magnificent. Huge, flavorful and all around award winning.  Had the creamed spinach ($10), creamed corn ($10) and steak fries ($10). The creamed corn want good. It was just bland. The rest were good.\n\nService is exceptional. Had a few Tito vodka Martina's with blue cheese olives as well Jacob were expertly made. For 5 of us the total bill was close to $1000. Be prepared to spend $$$.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Nestled back in the row of restaurants in the Venetian Hotel and Casino, Delmonico Steakhouse owned and operated by Chef Emeril Lagasse.  Offering up Orleans-style eats in a comfortable setting.  High back armless leather chairs and white linen set tables are scattered amongst white walls with pillars and great sloping arches.  A uniquely curved ceiling provided an interesting twist on the events of the night, as I was able to clearly listen in on several conversations from other tables as if they were seated next to me.  I only wonder if they were listening in on us?\n\nOn the way to our table we passed by a wall of wine encased in glass.  It was impressive to say the least and perusing their wine list hinted to the fact that it wasn't the only wall of wine in the establishment.  After calling for a nice bottle of champagne we ordered off of the menu and enjoyed an amuse buche.  A sort of pre-appetizer, a bite or two of something tasty, like something you might get at a cocktail party.\n\nThe wait staff was at our side at all times to make sure we had ample amounts of liquids and dinner breads.  We made a little joke how I was not able to finish my meal because the waitress kept calling for my bread dish to be refilled..."Would you like some more bread sir?"  If she had asked how I was feeling I would have responded "Better!"  I would had surely thrown in an extra hundred on the gratuity if she followed through with the Python joke or offered a thin wafer mint.\n\nI could go through all the parts of the meal but we know from previous reviews that the food is above board in the field of taste.  My only comment in regard to anything on the menu would be to the quality of the beef.  I am by no means a steak snob but I know quality beef when I taste it.  Having tasted beef from different locations around the world from Kansas to Kobe, Delmonico Steakhouse has much room to improve their quality of steak.  No matter how well seasoned or prepared the order was, if you start out with average prime beef you will be eating average prime beef and for that they lose one star.\n\nIf you do happen to stop by and eat at Delmonico, I suggest the sorbet desert, the multitude of tasty wines and the special... whatever it is.\n\nBe prepared for the price, because this place is proud of their food.  Four guests, champagne dinner with desert was well over $100 per person.  Will we be back?  But of course!  Las Vegas is the place for over indulgences.  What happens in Vegas... along with your money, stays in Vegas so enjoy it while you are there.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I came here with some girlfriends during my Bachelorette weekend in Vegas. We had a reservation for 7 girls, and were very promptly sat at our reservation hour.\n\nThe service here is spectacular, and the food is equally enjoyable. My girls and I shared our entrees and side dishes, so that we could each have a taste of a little bit of everything.\n\nEntrees:\n- FILET MIGNON - 9 oz, and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth yummy. This cut was like BUTTER.\n- EMERIL'S BBQ SALMON - Also melted like butter with every bite. It was amazing how tender, yet well-cooked the fish was. The hash side dish that came with the meal was very complimentary!\n- GRILLED MARINATED ORGANIC CHICKEN BREAST - Mostly juicy (a teeny bit dry), but great flavors. The fingerling potatoes were pretty standard, and the wild mushrooms weren't very tasty to me.\n- BONE IN RIBEYE - 20 oz, and great for sharing! Our waiter even cut the steak for our girls so that each could have medium rare/well.\n- AMERICAN RED SNAPPER - the sides didn't seem as appealing at first for my friend who had this dish, but she ended up enjoying them!\n\nSides:\n- CREAMED CORN GRATINÉE - delicious. A great combination of that sweet and salty flavor. Texture was right on point!\n- BUTTERED FRESH ASPARAGUS - fabulous crunch, and not so much flavor added to cover up the natural enjoyable flavor of the veggie\n\nAll in all, a great experience. We weren't too full at the end of the meal, and didn't have to worry about wasting any food or taking back any leftovers.\n\nHighly recommended!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The steak melts in your mouth. This restaurant is superb. The food is wonderful. The service is fantastic. You should make a reservation.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	So I was in town again and felt like having steak since we ate at Tao the previous night. My friend suggested that I dine here. I liked the mood and settings of the restaurant. We got a quiet cozy corner. Order a few glasses of read wine to go with the filet I ordered. Overall, it was a good experience. Nothing spectacularly special. Food was above average.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Date: July 8, 2005\nLocation: The Venetian Resort Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas\nCorkage: $25/bottle\nCost: $450 - party of four (including tax, tip & corkage)\nReservation: 702.414.3737\nWebsite: www.emerils.com\n\nTo my surprise, got a last minute reservation through opentable.com just a couple of days before the trip to Vegas. So instead of Fleming's, Capital Grille, or BOA, the three other places I had thought about to kick off my friend's bachelor party weekend, this is where we end up for dinner on the Friday night.\n\nThe four of us arrived about 15 minutes early and were promptly seated, busy but not completely packed.\n\nThe service was above average, but not warm, mechanical is the best word to describe. I asked for the three bottles of wine I brought to be decanted, which was no problem at all. No Riedels, but nice enough stemware to pass.\n\nWe ordered an antipasto for the table to get started. I had the Classic Steak Tartare as the appetizer and had the dry-aged Bone In Rib Steak as the entree.\n\nThe Classic Steak Tartare is the best presentation of such I've seen. Tartare in the center with individual garnishes fanned out, completed with baguette toast points. Flavor was good, but missing the bam element I expected.\n\nThe Rib Steak I ordered was suppose to be medium-rare, but was closer to a medium, which was fine by me, as I tend to like it somewhere in between the two. Word of caution here, all four steaks we had at our table, the temperature were missed by close to one notch, rare = medium rare, medium-rare = medium...etc.\nGood piece of raw material, but the kitchen failed to make it stand-out. Again, seasoning was lacking, salt and pepper can definitely be used more liberally.\n\nOrdered three desserts to pass around the table to finish the dinner, nothing interesting here to write home about.\n\nThe total including tax, tip and corkage came out to be $450 for the four of us, not a bad price tag especially considering we are in Vegas.\n\nWith this outing, I think I am completely done with top name destination Vegas restaurants. Aureole, Bradley Ogden, \nPicasso and now this, none has given me a desire to visit for a second time.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Food quality disappointing. Not the best steak in Vegas.\n\nThree of us enjoyed two ribeyes ($52) and one filet ($46). Waiter told us their ribeye is the best steak in Vegas, but don't believe it. They were cooked correctly. The rub was rather bland and the crusting on the filet was hard. On a scale of one to ten, my ribeye overall was a 7. I've had 10's before in Vegas, so the competition is tough! But just claiming you have the best steak doesn't make it so.\n\nThe sides ($9 each) were disappointing. We ordered four. Creamed spinach, always a favorite of mine and recommended by the waiter, was just odd and bland - didn't taste interesting or flavorful at all. The best side was the asparagus, but honestly, how hard is it to steam asparagus?\n\nDesert, as it often is at these kind of places where desert is an afterthought, was disappointing and ended the overall experience on a "blah" note.\n\nWine list was excellent.\n\nWith so many great places in Vegas, you can do much better. Everything else was top notch, but the food is the core of the experience and Delmonicos is just average, unfortunately.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Everything we had was amazing here. \nGreat service, great atmosphere and best of all... great food.\nTruffle Potato Chips... highly recommend.  When I first saw it... was a little skeptical. But.. they are amazing.\nVine rippen tomato salad, really good.  cheese was super fresh and the tomatos were very sweet and rip.  \nRib Eye - was perfectly cook, medium rare.  perfect crust and was just so good.  \nI can see why my friends made it a tradition to come here.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is probably my favorite steakhouse.i ordered the filet mignon and it was great. Very nice staff, great, professional, high quality service! Only downside is that the dining room feels a little cramped, tables are close and pretty noisy.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The Bone-in ribeye was excellent.   The apps and the wine were great, and the service was prompt and friendly.    I will recommend this as a great place to go for a steak in Vegas!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	First impressions......Unfortunately, Delmonico Steakhouse made a huge mistake when they seated my party of three at the table right in front of the kitchen door with a restaurant that was less than half full.  Offensive and unacceptable.  The hostess ran in one direction and a staff member told us we would have to make our way back up to the front to deal with this issue when we told them that this would not work for us.  After a word with someone who claimed to be the manager at the front, we were reseated and promptly given complimentary truffle chips (that can solve any bad first impression).  The truffle chips are not to be missed.  \n\nService-  Our server eventually warmed up and was pleasant.   He was so caught up in his speeches about different parts of the menu and recommendations, that it took some time to see his true personality.  He was also rushed, which was odd, as we had some menu questions.  \n\nFood-  The filet was magical.  This is the primary reason that the restaurant got 4 stars.  The creole seasoning and dab of BUTTER on the steak were an amazing and sinful treat.  Really delicious.\n\nThe cheese grits were delicious.  I was a bit less impressed with the creamed spinach.  The waiter said that it was better than CUT's version.  NO WAY!  Underwhelming.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great Steakhouse. I was delighted to come and try this place. I haven't heard too much about what the steak was like hear but I heard all good things about it. \n\nAs we sat down we were great by two men who were going to be our servers and our waiters for the day. I ended up ordering a Bone In rib Steak. I think it was the most expensive steak on the menu. I wasn't too sure about the size but my friends that came before said that it was a good size and that some of them couldn't finish it. \n\nWhen I finally got the steak. It had a little piece of butter on the top and it looked good. I usually have my steak medium and it was perfect. I loved it. We also ordered some sides of grits, spinach and mushrooms. Those were ok to me. I loved the steak though. I wasn't able to eat the last 3 oz or so. I think it was well over 16 oz steak with the bone. I think everyone finished theirs except for me. I did notice that my friend said the my steak looked bigger. I couldn't complain at all. All in all we spend about $80 for dinner. I didn't order anything besides the steak and splitting the appetizers. \n\nIt was well worth it. I have spent more at other places and not even felt like I was eating enough. This takes the cake. \n\nI liked how the servers were prompt with filling up my water and attentive to our needs. They would even fold your dinner napkin if you left the table. Awesome. I felt somewhat cramped on our circular table, but what do you expect from a large group of 9 guys.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is probably one of my favorite places for steak, bread pudding, or when I wanna eat at the bar alone. Here is a summary of one of my experiences that I shared with one of my foodie friends when we ate here. \n\nWe ordered the Caesar Salad which was spectacularly prepared fresh able side by the maitre 'd. It was like $30 but probably THE best salad of my life! Next was the bone in rib eye which was so perfectly seasoned and cooked! I'm a huge fan of sides so I got the creamed spinach, a Idaho baked potato, creamed corn, and asparagus. YES, there were amazing left overs!\n\nFor dessert of course it was the White Chocolate Macadamia nut Bread Pudding! If anyone knows Emril's shows or books you know this is like his signature item. I have also had the Duck Egg Creme Brulee which is heavenly as well. But my go to is the bread pudding!\n\nThis is a place you probably wouldn't wanna eat at daily, but it is a place to take special friends who enjoy good food at it's best or for an awesome night of self spoiling! :)\n\n*Lobster bique, the butternut squash ravioli and the fried chicken are killer too!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	It is with a heavy heart, a disappointed palate, and an empty stomach that I write this review. At around 8:40pm on a Wednesday like any other, an amazing 20 ounce bone-in ribeye was murdered by the cooks at Delmonico Steakhouse in Las Vegas, Nevada. A senseless, tragic loss really. \n\nThe LD: Husband and I went for dinner. Were seated immediately; had reservations. Place was crowded; however, several tables were empty. Servers (yes, plural; they employ a multi-function staff system) were friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nV&S for myself, beer for hub. Both ordered the highly recommended in-house aged big ass ribeye; cooked med-rare please? Add a side of asparagus. \n\nDrinks were delivered, as was a meh amuse bouche (didn't do much to invoke my appetite). While waiting on main course, we sat with empty drink glasses for approximately 15 minutes. "Yes, please, another round" after flagging someone down.  \n\nThe highly anticipated steaks arrived. Had SO looked forward to dining (have been to Delmonico in N'Oleans and LOVED it) - salivating for the meat like Pavlov's dog.\n\nHusband cut into his steak first and I awed at the perfection. Beautifully cooked (I know my steak temps well and am quite skilled on the grill if I may say so; #humblebrag, but I do live in Texas after all). I could immediately tell when my plate was sat down in front of me my steak was overcooked. I even whispered it to my spouse. Sure enough, borderline well-done on the edges. I optimistically had hoped it would be less done toward the thicker center and toward the bone. Nope.   \n\nWhen a waiter came to follow-up and ask how the steak was, I informed him mine...well, was not good. He did offer to refire; however, given the speed that my husband eats, and the amount of time it took the food to be delivered in the first place, I [foolishly] declined and stated that it was "fine."\n\nManagement comped one of the two Tito's I ordered as an apology; however, this did little to suppress my internal sadness and the most amount of disappointment I'd had since losing my ars at the blackjack tables the night before. \n\nIn all fairness, the staff at D's did try their best to accommodate. I probably should have allowed them a second chance to present a well-prepared piece of beef. It wasn't until I got home and found the $164 (w/out tip) receipt from the night in my wallet that I began to feel what can only be described as selfish-remorse (aka, sometimes referred to as "buyer's remorse").\n\nSo after a few days of ruminating (as females are sometimes known to do), I called the restaurant and told them I regretted my decisions and to thank them for at least attempting to "satisfy the customer." Without any provocation, the manager offered to send me a gift card for $50 to cover a steak during my next visit. I, of course, did not expect the offer, but happily provided my mailing address. \n\nI have found that an unfortunate outcome of many "celebrity" chef restaurants opening in LV is that the quality of both service and food suffer. It's the nature of Sin City and the abundance of tourism - people from all over the world with very different palates - some more or less discerning than others. :'(  \n\nSo, now I have a GC that I can redeem at any of Emeril's establishments. I doubt I'll be using it at Delmonico in Vegas baby, because frankly I've left the building and think I'll stick to D's in the Big Easy. Sin City killed the beefy magic for me. Cheers!\n\n[151 in 2015]
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Started off with a Chimay Blue beer and Gumbo and progressed to a perfectly cooked ribeye steak and garlic sautéed mushrooms. Very delicious.  Especially with the Oscar style asparagus a must.  Highly recommend it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Disappointing. The positives: top notch staff and service. They were knowledgeable, prompt and friendly. From the bartender who gave me a great suggestion for my Cabernet to our waiter who was very attentive.  Downside: completely bland decor. I'm used to steakhouses having a great classic feel that welcomes you in. This place was drab, and nothing special. As for our steaks, they were just ok; we expected much more. The heirloom tomatoes and burrata were a nice starter. But our overall experience was of a place we'd not return to. When you pay over $40 for a steak, it should be delicious.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great steaks, awesome service and comfortable settings.  This is a steakhouse, don't expect too much other then steakhouse classics and wonderful desserts.  Food is good, not amazing, would return for sure.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Just got back from Vegas and our second visit to Delmonico. We had the Filet Medallions($48) and they were Heavenly ! They had a carmelized onion,Mushroom mixture with a Parmesan crust that absolutely sent them into Orbit !!!!! Not to mention the Prime Dry Aged Filet that was literally "Cake" tender and had a deep beef flavor. We also had the Jumbo Australian Lobster tail that was sweet and cooked to perfection in a white wine reduction with aromatic veggies/herbs($95).May I also suggest the Bone In Ribeye($55) which is the house specialty....it's to die for !!!!  In regards to attire it seems like a dressy place but folks were showing up with Tommy Bahama Shirts,Shorts and flip flops and were seated without question and some were "dudded up". My wife and I ate for about $200 but it was worth every penny !This a must stop for a special dinner if your a steak lover !!!!   Oh....our table as well as everyone else's had four servers and a host !!!! Exemplary Service
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We couldn't help but take a photo with our favorite server, Michael Jackson. We are fortunate to have experienced Michael Jackson's tailored hospitality, authentic personality, and genuine interest in our dining. Of course the food is excellent, but we come here because our service is impeccable.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Been wanting to go here for a long time so when a media contact/vendor asked me to lunch here I didn't hesitate!  The ambiance was lovely, low light, tasteful decorations, great big leather chairs.  We had water, bbq shrimp, lobster sliders, steak medallions with side of garlic mashed, chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  \n\nBBQ shrimp was delicious!  Had a homemade bbq sauce that was just tangy, sweet and rich enough.  Large shrimp came with about five I think very yummy.  \n\nMy entree was the something something steak medallions - (sorry it's not on the lunch menu online and I can't remember exactly what it was called) it was EXTRAORDINARY.  I think after looking through the photos they were the Filet Mignon Medallions - I am a red meat junkie and before this Carnevino was the best steak I ever had - this one ranks right up there.  Perfectly medium rare, flavorful with delicious meaty mushrooms, and as tender as a steak could be.  Just delicious.  Be warned it doesn't come with ANYTHING - just the meat so be sure and order a side dish or two.  I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes which come in this cool metal pan/dish thing.  They are a very large portion so that was good.  The mashed potatoes were soooooooooooooo creamy.  Very very good.  \n\nWe ordered the chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  This is why I gave only four stars - the cake a'ight.  Nothing special.  It was enormous though so you'll get the bang for your buck.  My sister is a pastry chef so I might be a little extra picky on my dessert but there you have it.  \n\nFor what we ordered plus my vendor ordered an additional 3-scoop bowl of coconut ice cream on the side it came to $91.  It's pricey - so be sure to eat the warm bread they give you at the beginning so you can be full, lol.  But the portion sizes were generous, the service was INCREDIBLE and the food delish.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico's is an institution - but it's by no means a "5-Star" steakhouse.  Historically, it was one of the first really credible celebrity chef steakhouses in Vegas - despite the fact that Emeril Lagasse really wasn't the founder of the original Delmonico's of New Orleans.\n\nBAD NEWS:  NOT UP TO PAR WITH THE NEW ORLEANS ORIGINAL\nPatterned after the original which resides in New Orleans, Delmonico's serves delicious, beefy steaks with services & class befitting a Louisiana.  For those of you who've been to the New Orleans steakhouse, let me assure you that like the Vega rendition of "Commander's Palace", you will NOT get the same quality at the Vegas "Delmonico's".    And that's a shame because to this day, one of the top 3 steaks I've ever eaten was at the New Orleans' Delmonico's... not the Vegas location.\n\nGOOD NEWS:  IT'S STILL A GOOD PLACE FOR STEAKS\nBut I don't think you'll leave terribly disappointed.  Everything from the cigars to the baked potato to the crab legs and lobster tails to the steaks themselves - it's all still pretty good.  (More on the beef later.)  Items are always served hot, and plates are served in synchronicity to all guests with multiple waiters.  The wine list is the size of Godzilla and their humidor has a colossal assortment of cigars that would make Bill Clinton giddy.\n\nAND WHAT ABOUT THE STEAKS, SERVICE, ETC.?\nHere's the thing:  They prepare it correctly every time and their service is their hallmark.  However when it comes to different categories (Flavor, service, décor) it kinda varies on how they rank:\n1) FLAVOR\nI have to hand it to Envy the Steakhouse over Delmonico's and I think Charlie Palmer's outdoes it as well in most aspects.  Michael Mina's StripSteak probably outdoes it for at least flavor.  Meanwhile Craftsteak has consistently softer, more buttery servings of the same cuts.  It's probably a close tie with PRIME Steakhouse at the Bellagio.  \n...but it beats going to CUT, Carnevino, N9NE Steakhouse, & Circus Circus Steakhouse in my experience.  \n2) SERVICE\nIf you're looking for prompt service with an attention to detail, it's hard to beat Delmonico's.  That's something they have down really well.  Only Envy & Charlie Palmer's probably rival it and Envy only gets the nod because there's rarely many people there so service is often 1 to 1.  Everyone else kinda pales in comparison - especially CUT & StripSteak where I've consistently gotten sketchy service.  I strongly suspect that my service would have been 3x better had I had my host make the reservation instead of calling it in myself.\n3) DÉCOR\nIt's darker, candlelit ambiance is romantic but not very illustrious compared to the views of PRIME or the décor of Carnevino.  Most steakhouses I've noticed are pretty bland and non-descript in general (N9NE is utterly weird - what with all the white walls and junk) though so I'm not sure this is really a big point.  \n\nCONCLUSION:\nDelmonico's, while it's lost some luster compared to some of the other big name talents in the Vegas steak industry, still holds its own amongst the heavyweights.  Kind of a reasonably reliable, middle of the pack, horse that you can depend on for a decent - but pricey - meal.\n\n3 1/2-stars... rounded up, as a tip of the hat to tradition.\n\n-----------------\nINSIDER'S TIP:  GETTING INTO DELMONICO'S WITHOUT A RESERVATION\nVery simple:  $50 to the maitre d' will quietly grease your way from having a cocktail at the bar to a table with immediate service usually within 60 seconds - no questions asked.  You'll either need to reach over registration to pass the bill to him/her or call him/her around to shake his hand and simply mention that you appreciate their hard work getting you a table.  \n...In general, tips really work at Delmonico's in all aspects of the restaurant.  From the wait staff to the bartender to the resident sommelier.  I've pulled this more than a dozen times without fail with the maitre d' during booked solid conventions from CES recently to going back to the COMDEX days.  \n...This may seem obvious to some, but the key is that the tip angle on 'immediate seating' only works in places where tables are reserved for hotel VIPs.  (For example, Nobu's really has no such seating other than "next table available")
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonicos is a great restaurant, there is no doubt about that. I ordered a Bone in Rib eye medium rare.  The steak was cooked to perfection.  I felt it lack the salt and pepper seasoning on the crust.  I ended up having to get some finishing salt to give it a little more flavor.  \n\nI will go there again if I stay at the Palazzo, but I still have a preference to a couple other steaks houses.  service was great, food was great. just thought the steak could have been a little better seasoned.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place was very nice nd the service was great. The food was good and because of the setting and the service i did not mind the prices. i will be back
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The fact that we were able to change our reservation for 8 people, three different times on a very crowded Mothers Day weekend should've been my first clue that this wasn't going to be a great meal. The steaks had absolutely NO flavor, the options weren't good and the ahi salad with a whopping 3 small pieces of tuna was far from worth the cost. I come to the Venetian very often as an invited guest and have never had such a sub-par dining experience. With so many other great options don't bother with this one....
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Bone in Ribeye Filet - 5 Star\nGreen Bean Almodine - 5 Star\nWine pairing - 5 Star\nPecan pie - 5 Star\n\n5 Star place with 5 Star food and staff. I had the special bone-in Ribeye filet with wine pairing. The food and service fabulous. After dinner the chef even came out to talk to me. \n\nThis was the best food and restaurant experience I have ever had.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	i have to admit, i had a bad experience at this steakhouse from the service being so-so to the food being o.k. the biggest disappointment is that my girlfriends steak and my steak were both cooked incorrectly. i ordered my steak medium rare, my gal medium well. at first i thought the waiter got us mixed up regarding how we wanted our steaks cooked because mines was well done and my girl friends was on the rare side. so when our waiter came back and asked us how everything was, i asked him, "how did i order my steak?" he replied, medium rare. i got my steak knife and cut right down the middle of my steak and showed it to the waiter and he glanced at it and replied, looks like it was over cooked slightly. my girlfriend and i both noticed that our waiter was not exactly polite after we pointed out our steaks were cooked incorrectly and didn't offer to bring us new steaks knowingly that the cook blew it by a long shot with the beef. my steak was honestly cooked all the way through. no red and not even any pink. not the end of the world. though this was our saturday night dinner in vegas and we have heard sooo many good things about this restaurant. so we were quite disappointed when we had a somewhat rude waiter and food which was cooked incorrectly. we are going to try this place one more time and give them another shot. i think we just got unlucky. irregardless i have to give the rating in which they provided. sorry delmonico, maybe next time.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	After our poor dining experience at Valentino, we decided to try Emeril's restaurant, the Delmonico.  What a night and day difference.  While we'd had to put up with snobby staff at Valentino, the wait staff at Delmonico was informed, helpful, friendly, and a lot of fun to interact with.  And THE FOOD !!!  Oh my word, our ribeye steak was so fabulous we couldn't wait to try it again and went back the very next day for more of the same.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The steak was cooked perfectly and was worth the price. In addition, we ordered the truffle potato chips and devoured them in minutes. I also got a lychee drink which was pretty good but probably too expensive for me to ever order again. But if we're ever back in Vegas, we'll be sure to drop by this restaurant again for the steak!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went for my wife's Birthday and was very unimpressed with the food and service. Went to a show before so I dropped a wonderful bottle of wine before and felt insulted when the man at the front desk said "you know there is a $25 fee for corkage". If he would have bothered to look at the bottle he would have noticed that it was a very high end bottle of Napa Cab. Anyhow, we were seated and our waiter was trying to tell us how smart and connected he was with all the wineries and  then mispronounced the name of our wine. He never offered to decant it, that was unacceptable. So I ordered the Bone in Rib Eye and it was the toughest piece of steak I have had in a long time. My wife had he filet and loved it. We had creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms for our side, They were average at best. After mentioning the steak issue the waiter said he would "let somebody know". He never came back during service so I never had the chance to send it back. The waiter came back and said that corkage was $ 30 and he got someone to waive it. Funnt the guy up front said it was $ 25. Bottom line was Delmonico did not produce 5 Star food or service. Will not go back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Fabulous dining experience.\n\nLoved everything about Delmonico from the service, ambiance and most importantly the food. \n\nI had the Traditional New Orleans Gumbo and Lamb. I dont even know why I got the gumbo because it was very filling which I loved. But I wanted to save my tummy for the Lamb which was cook medium rare and the meat just fell off the bone. YUMMY!\n\nI will definitely come back here again.\n\nThis is a great place for groups before a crazy night in Vegas. :)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We spent our 24th wedding anniversery in Vegas and had to make a return to Delmonico since we had not been there sice 2008. It was great then and just as great this time.\n\nThe service and the food were over the top.Worth every penny spent. \nOh and the drinks were great as well.\n\nGET THE BREAD PUDDING ! :)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Juicy ribeye and tuna salmon tartare \n\nThe service was very good here. I really loved the ribeye, tuna salmon tartare, and their complimentary bread. The price is decent for an upscale dining restaurant. \n\nI tried other dishes my friends got and they weren't as good. My friends didn't really enjoy their filet mignon. I tried the pork chop and I thought the sauce was very salty. The bacon appetizer was good but tasted a bit salty as well. The creamed corn was very good but I didn't really like the bread crumbs on top of it. The creamed spinach was just ok. The potato side dish was just ok too. \n\nIf you have an occasion you are celebrating they give you a sorbet. They also gave us a small mousse type dish for being there for the first time so that was nice. The decor is simple and had a nice ambiance. It's a nice place to try in Venetian regardless.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The chicken andouille gumbo is perhaps the best I have ever had and the salt and pepper crust on the filets never disappoints.  I make sure to eat here every trip to Vegas - the food and the service are impeccable.  Also love the Abita products these folks offer (both beer and root beer).
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Best experience out of all the restaurants in Vegas. The service was 5 star. We felt like royalty. The Salmon and Filet Mignon were amazing. Most impressive dessert I've had, banana pudding with a delicious twist. \n\nBest broccoli wish I knew how they prepared it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Second favorite steakhouse in LV.  \n\nBest service and coolest staff all around.  Very attentive and accommodating.  Tuan the GM is the best!  This is why I have eaten here for 10+ years.  The best experience here was in the kitchen table a few years ago.  A must do at least once if you want to feel like a rockstar!  \n\nAll the steaks here excellent here along with the sides and truffle chips.  Too bad they stopped serving the chocolate souffle.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Came here per a friend's recommendation. My friend and I had the bbq shrimp appetizer which was tasty. We ordered the bone in rib eye with a side of mushrooms and spinach.  The steaks are HUGE and topped with butter. Butter makes everything taste better. We both couldn't finish our steaks but it was pretty darn good.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Overall, I thought Delmonico was unimpressive given its rep and price point. I would suggest SW Steakhouse or Gordon Ramsay instead. \n\nHere's the salient-\n\nService\nThe Staff was friendly enough but nothing special. There was a LOUD diner (really loud as I'm from NYC and used to noisy restaurants) and, despite my request, my server did not ask the guy to take it down a notch. \n\nFood\n- The popovers, to start, were good but I was disappointed that no other bread was offered, which is usually the case with steakhouses.\n- The word that comes to mind when describing the quality of the filet is mediocre. It looked like it had been pulverized with a meat mallet. Pretty bland and not juicy at all.\n- My friend did enjoy his pork chop and it looked much better than my steak. \n- The twice baked potato was a big disappointment given that the bottom of it felt rock hard and the whipped potato on top was bland.\n- The fried apple pies were adequate. My friend really liked the pecan pie.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I'm struggling to figure out why I am rating this four stars instead of five. I guess that five stars is perfection and nothing is perfect, right? \n\nWe (me, wife, and my parents) at here on Sunday, August 2, at 7:00. We reserved via OpenTable and were promptly seated in a very nice location. Even though the restaurant was busy the tables on either side of us were kept empty until we were leaving, which was a very nice touch. My wife and I, and my parents, were celebrating our wedding anniversaries, and I noted this with OpenTable. This was communicated to the restaurant and they treated us very nice. \n\nThe service was extremely good. Each table is assigned three people: a head waiter, an assistant waiter, and a buser. All were very polite and professional. The buser was a bit green but that is OK; her mistakes were very minor. The head waiter was exceptional - I don't remember his name and I feel bad for not being able to call him out and recognize him here. The second waiter was also very good; again, I forget her name. \n\nVery good bread was brought to the table and a complimentary appetizer was served to us that consisted of a very yummy chicken salad. My wife and I ordered the table-side Caesar salad and it was worth the $30. The table-side preparation is neat to watch, and she did a great job with it. The entire salad is made from scratch at the table. This Caesar goes right to the top of my list as my very favorite Caesar and almost makes up for the beat-down I got at the Palazzo's craps table right before dinner. My dad ordered a shrimp cocktail that looked excellent. \n\nMy dad and I both had the boneless rib eye and my mom and wife split the filet. It was all good; in fact, I could have used a smaller steak. The waiter said it was 14-16 ounces but this was definitely bigger. For sides we ordered the asparagus, which I don't eat, and the small potatoes with garlic, which were very good. \n\nI had a root beer float for dessert - I liked the fact that there were some old favorites on the dessert menu, including peach cobbler. \n\nWith two bottles of wine (at $65/bottle) we spent over $400 (before tip) on dinner but all agreed that it was money well spent. \n\nAbout the only negative is the couple who brought a very small child (6 months?) into the restaurant with them. The baby wasn't doing well and cried somewhat - shame on the parents.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Honestly, I wanted to like this place. This was not our first time there but it will be our last. The Cesar salad was the highlight of the meal and still one of the best I've ever had. The steak was just OK. The sides were quite good but it is a steakhouse so I was expecting something much better. The deserts were not bad just not mind blowing. For the price, unfortunately it was not worth it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	What can I say.. Wowzers! Probably one of the best steak houses I've been too. Service was absolutely flawless and dinner was excellent . Ordered seafood tower, wedge, wagyu filet, chateaubriand, bacon grits and sautéed  mushrooms Will definitely be back!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place is a good place to go with your significant other but the seats are really close so it's difficult to have an intimate conversation....\n\nReally good food but the service is just OK.\n\nThe only thing that I would go here for is Gumbo and Chocolate Souffle.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had the filet and wife had the porterhouse, the steak was good but not worth the steep price tag.  My filet was actually chewy.  The chocolate cake dessert was fantastic fyi. And the atmosphere was lack luster and the crowds we were near ruined it.  Drunk and loud.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The steaks here are perfectly cooked! \n\nI topped by bone-in ribeye with a serving of seared foie gras. The meal was rich, decadent, and as everything I imagined it to be! I even split the steak and left very, very full. The foie gras reminded me of when I ate my way through eastern Europe 4 years ago. I've had a really tough time finding comparable seared foie gras State-side until I came here.\n\nAll of the sides were delicious. I think I had the creamed corn, spinach, and mushrooms.\n\nSkip the BBQ shrimp. It was a big disappointment coming from a man who prides himself in creole/cajun cooking.\n\nThe restaurant itself is really intimate. The ceilings are low and vaulted, so it's like you're in an underground church or something. My one gripe is that it's a little noisy because of the set up. \n\nOf course, the service was wonderful, as expected. We were a group of 12 or so girls, there for a bachelorette party, and they handled us efficiently and graciously.\n\nIt's a great place to go if you're up on poker and want to splurge on a big slice of meat!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Soo pricey but what a delicious meal.  My filet was a perfect medium rare and the spices they had for the charring made it one of the best steaks i've had in my life
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We visited this past week and were disappointed in the food. Given the restaurant's high rating and prices, my steak was lacking. The steak had a thick salty crust, which I did not care for. The chips and service were very good though!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	It wasnt the best ive had but it was good. I like my steak medium but it was alittle on the burnt side. I didnt want to complain since it was still good and edible. \n\nThe service was great.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I came here for work - I am not a big steak eater so if that is the kind of review you are looking for skip it.  Everyone knows the real reason to go to steak houses is for the side dishes and they do have good side dishes.  Our server was also very friendly about our changing party size and I had no problems with the reservations.  I am giving it 4 instead of 5 bc of ambiance- they could have done a little better here.  It is a little boring and white-walled, plus the bar area feels too open to the casino for me.  Plus side though it is right around the corner from the new Barneys so you can buy bags or shoes before/after.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Service was Horrible, Food was Cold, Drinks were Hot!  Just plain Lousy.\nVery Disappointing!  Go to Prime Steak House instead @ the Bellagio
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is my go to spot when I have a steak craving and money to burn. My last birthday was spent here and it was worth. My son and I went, he's 11, and there wasn't any down grade to the service despite it being only 2 of us. I have had this happen in other high end places where they see a kid and think small check. This was some of the best carpaccio around, the drinks were awesome and the steaks cooked perfect;y.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico Steakhouse was pretty good, but definitely not the best I've had nor without flaws.\n\nThe food and drink choices seem to be where they really excel, as there were a number of options that my girlfriend and I found to be mouth-watering, from the bone-in ribeye, the fillet, the chicken, salmon, etc.  They had my favorite beer (Chimay Blue) and she enjoyed her wine (she had the Chardonnay and Riesling).  What we wanted when going here was a nice, fancy dinner as a tribute to our vacation together.  It wasn't a special occasion or anything but we like to have a quality dinner from time to time.  I'd say the food part of Emeril's more or less did the trick with regards to that.\n\nThe service was OK.  While they were relatively prompt the matre'd was the person who seemed to be serving us and he was just a little too over-the-top for me, not to mention he seemed a little condescending and careless.  Perhaps I just read into it wrong, but I didn't feel as comfortable as I have at other restaurants.  Our waiters made sure the waters and bread kept coming, which I appreciated.  The matre'd didn't really do anything rude per-say, but I did notice that at one point when he came by to check on everything he spoke with the tables on our left and right but not with us.  \n\nThe smaller tables are a little too big IMO, my girlfriend and I felt a mile away from each other and eventually I just moved my place settings next to her and sat with her so we could talk easier.  This is probably not an issue if you have a big group, but for a romantic evening it wasn't fantastic.  Speaking of romance, there were no candles, the lightning was bright, and the restaurant was devoid of decor. \n\nI don't mean to rip Delmonico's so much but I just want to stress that this restaurant really doesn't deserve 5 stars despite the food being pretty tasty.  Our stakes came out medium rare as requested, they were juicy and delicious, and the side "double-baked potato" + "Asparagus" was fantastic.\n\nI realized going here and glancing at the menu online that the prices were going to be steep but I guess my wallet received a shock even so.  I had initially been hoping that our bill would come to about $115-130, but in the end it was $200 because you have to buy sides for your meal separately and the wine / beer was very expensive.  The problem with this is that in Vegas there is a lot of competition and I've had food that was on par with this for under half the price of what I paid.  For instance Mon Ami Gabi (outside of Paris, Paris) and Trevi (Ceasar's Palace Forum Shops) both run in the $60-100 range (for two) and are just as tasty IMO.\n\nLastly, there were a nat or two flying around toward the end of our meal, something which is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber.  \n\nI enjoyed the overall experience but I would not dine here again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	if you're looking for a fancy steakhouse in vegas, delmonico is your go to place. not being a huge fan of emeril lagasse's, my prenotions and opinions were turned 180 degrees after one dining experience in this magnificent establishment.\n\nnothing here is shy of a stellar review. the food is PERFECTLY executed, the service is above and beyond, and no detail is left unfinished.\n\nthe steaks can be requested with an extra char on the outside, but the center is still a warm medium rare, perfectly juicy and exploding with flavor in every bite. the sides we ordered were also high acheivers and could be main courses in their own right. \n\nthe desserts were phenomenal! i've had emeril's banana cream pie from another one of his restaurants at MGM before, but the warm chocolate brioche bread pudding is like your birthday, christmas, new year, all the holidays, the birth of your first child, happiest day of your life in every spoonful. it was so good, i wanted to cry.\n\nif you are ever in vegas and want to have a flawless steak dinner, now you know where to go.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This was by far the worst meal I have ever had.  Not steak,   Meal!  I went with a group of 4, only 1 steak was cooked correctly and it was super fatty. I had a filet ordered medium to medium well black, it showed up well done with no char whatsoever.  My friend ordered hers blue and it showed up rare. My husband's was fine but like I said super fatty. The other friends was over cooked as well along with the snottiest looking disgusting foie gras I have ever seen. Bottom line_ you go to Vegas to have a great meal and it sucked.  All of it sucked. Go somewhere else for $100pp.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Hands down, the best steak I've had.\nWe were staying at Palazzo, and decided to eat at the hotel on our first night.\nThe restaurant had plenty of seats and we were seated right away as we walked in.\nWe shared a salad and a side of sauteed mushrooms, I had their filet mignon, and boyfriend had the ribeye. EVERYTHING including the mushrooms were memorable, and we weren't even that hungry when we walked in. I wish Emeril would open one in San Francisco, so we can go back on our special occasions more conveniently.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Really a top-flight dining experience, and my favorite Vegas steakhouse. The food is terrific, the room is dignified and the service is what really takes it over the top. The staff here are true professionals and it shows. Very impressive. \n\nNo, it isn't cheap but then again, is any good Vegas restaurant? Sometimes you get what you pay for, and at Delmonico you get a terrific, classy dining experience. \n\nThe only disappointment: they no longer offer their New Orleans version of Oysters Rockefeller, which was one of my favorite appetizers anywhere. Our waiter told me they could make it happen next time if I call ahead and ask. I just might do that, and I'll definitely be back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My fiance and I went back to Delmonico during our most recent Vegas trip. Everything was still wonderful; I could literally bathe in that gumbo.\n\nI wanted to say our service this time was great. Drew and Miesha really took care of us and should be given extra accolades for being so attentive and providing honestly, one of the best fine dining service experiences I ever had.\n\nThank you guys! And yes, and please bring back the warm soft rolls you served during Winter '13, those were amazing! I miss those rolls!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Amazing...best steak ever.  Had the bone in ribeye and was outstanding.  Service was excellent, food was pricey but worth it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This popular dining spot deserves its reputation as the best steakhouse in Vegas. The ribeye steak was as good as it gets. The house special bacon-wrapped quail was cooked to perfection. But the banana cream pie was horrible. It almost seemed like we were served a slice that was two weeks old - Very dry and not very creamy.\nToo bad the meal ended with luke warm coffee and no refills to wash down the pie. I have to say the service was uneven, like we were an afterthought once dessert was served.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Best Steak I ever eaten - Delmonico Rib Eye. It's pricey but worth it. You will not be disappointed.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	It's hard for me to only give four stars but....  I ate at CUT WHICH IS a two minute walk from Delmonicos two nights ago.   The service was great the food was good but CUT is a masterpiece the Mona Lisa.  I ordered the spinach salad which was very good fresh and delicious.  For my main course I ordered the bone in rib eye "house specialty"  it was great but it did not compare to the magic of my CUT ribeye.  This is an excellent restaurant the only flaw is its two minutes away from CUT!  It's like playing basketball next to Jordan baseball next to Ruth.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Beautiful restaurant, thoughtful staff. Some of the best food I have ever had plus kick ass cocktails. My only complaint is not their fault. We are only in vegas for 2 nights and i see a food coma in my future.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Best filet mignon of my life...cooked to perfection with cajun spices. The wine list blew my socks off...and I am a viticulture/enology geek (in normal English...I am a wine snob). This, was in fact, the most impressive part of my meal here. I couldn't stop turning the pages of the wine list (evidently the largest wine list on the West Coast). The sides are unbelievable and complementary to the steak. I highly recommend the carrot cake for dessert. Emeril sure outdid himself here.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My Husband took me here for our anniversary dinner. We arrived early at five because we had theatre tickets and had made dinner reservations accordingly.  The restaurant is beautiful with cream walls, rock wood and glass throughout with romantic lighting the evening was looking good. We ordered starters Crab Cakes for my husband nice crispy well seasoned crab I love a crab cake that is more crab then filler and this one was that. I ordered the steak tartar because I've never had it and wanted to be daring. I have to say I was scared lol but it was so worth it. Wonderful crisp toasted baguettes with rich beef capers oil and seasoning and spicy mustard sauce  this has got to be one of the best dishes I've ever eaten and a must try. We then followed this with Lobster bisque  rich warm and creamy with plenty of lobster one of my favorite lobsters bisques definitely.  I had the petite iceberg lettuce wedges a nice take on the classic salad with Wisconsin blue cheese buttermilk dressing homemade apple wood bacon and just the right amount of red onion really tangy. For our entrée we had chosen to go with the  Chateaubriand for two. They carve it tableside and serve it with asparagus and garlic potatoes The sides were actually very good but the meat was just ok nothing special and more red then I care for We had also ordered a side of sautéed garlic wild mushrooms which were also just ok I've had better versions of both these dishes. On to dessert we were bad and ordered two. The Chocolate root beer float which was not that great I guess we just didn't care for the ginger and chocolate flavors together so we didn't finish this one but the banana cream pie was like biting into heaven little shavings of chocolate rich sweet whipped cream bananas and sweet rich caramel sauce make up this dish and it's worth every calorie that's probably packed into it. So splurge and have it it's amazing. The wait staff was amazing making sure you never wanted for anything and that everything went smoothly and the wine selection and service was top notch. Definitely worth the splurge
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My husband and I went there for lunch on a Saturday. We had a physically exhausting week so we decided to treat ourselves. But it hasn't always been easy for our allergy whenever we ate out. So we called Delmonico ahead to see if they can accommodate our special needs. The lady who answered our call was very courteous and we felt comfortable to try after having some answers from her.\nAs we arrived, the restaurant has a comfortable ambience. I wouldn't say it is grand or special but just comfortable. When it was time to order, the server was courteous regarding our allergy too and I believe the one who took care of us was a manager. He even checked with the chef to make sure the complimentary popover was okay for us to consume. We told them we are allergic to soy, corn, peanut, tomato and pork products, and some other stuff, and he had been very mindful and advised accordingly as we ordered, he did it so graciously that we didn't feel being put in a spot. Some other semi high end restaurants had given us a startled face or even an uncomfortable face when we mentioned our allergy, but this manager was super professional that he didn't make us feel crappy about our differences from others. So he made a potential stressful situation easy for us, very impressive.\nTheir steak was aged in house by the restaurant and we think their aging was done fabulously as there was no rotten smell or taste in it. The manager even double checked with us and informed us that the beef was sourced from corn fed cows and asked if we would be able to tolerate that. And we made our decision to say yes and went ahead with the steak. Their steaks were very delicious. We actually asked for medium well with no seasoning and the steak still came out super delicious and juicy. So the good quality is in the steak itself and didn't need to depend on seasoning or being served bloodily. Again, very impressive.\nAnyway, it was a delicious meal and we were well taken care of so we didn't get sick from any event of undisclosed allergens. We are very happy with this meal. We would go back when we have another time wanting to treat ourselves again. Hopefully the manager will be there again the next time we visit.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We hosted our wedding night dinner at Delmonicos. They took great care of all 11 of us. Great wine suggestions, the accomodated the kids and anticipated their needs by putting the sauce on the side in case the kids didn't like it.\n\nThe level of service is pretty spectacular but when you add the quality and flavor of the food... wow! From the appetizers to dessert it was perfect. I was expecting small food portions but we all had leftovers!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	OMG, was the first thing I said when I bit into the juicy, delicious, tender bone in ribeye. Yes very pricey but HUGE serving. All the sides were delicious as well; au gratin, broccoli, medley of mushrooms, popovers, asparagus. Really delicious. My friend had the lamb chops. This meal was so fulfilling, definitely bigger portions than expected so  next time sharing may be perfect. But absolutely delicious and great service and I just have to say, our buss boy was hot!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Wide whiskey selection, excellent bartenders. I'm assuming the food was good, but even though I came four days in a row I never made it past the bar.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Not too fond of the atmosphere but the food and service was great.  I have to say that the bone in rib eye I had here years ago reigned for many years as champion, the very best steak I've ever had in my entire life until last year when that title was taken from Emeril Legasi by Tom Colicchio at his restaurant Craft Steakhouse.  So Delmonico is one of my all time favorite steak joints.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place was delicious and the staff was very friendly and helpful.  My favorite favorite thing was the Lobster Bisque.  It had a empanada like thing in the soup packed with lobster. \n\nIf only I could find that here....
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Truffle chips were so delicious.  Caesar isn't really worth it.  Steak was ok, needed more flavor in my opinion.  So happy to see foie gras on their menu but it was just ok - I've had better.  The scalloped potatoes were under cooked so we had to send it back - boo boo.  Everything else was ok.  Great service.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've walked by Delmonico and stopped to look at the menu many times as I've gone through restaurant row on my way to/from the parking garage at the Palazzo.  With a show later, I made an early reservation for Delmonico.  I was promptly greeted and seated.\n\nI knew the steaks were large unless I got a petit filet (not my favorite cut of steak) so I ordered a bone in ribeye, a side of cheesy grits with bacon, and then bread pudding for dessert. I had a trio of servers who took good care of service.  \n\nI ordered the steak cooked blue and it was close to that but a bit beyond.  The steak was quite average.  The steak was pre-seasoned and it was OK.  The star of dinner was the cheesy grits with bacon.  They were very good!\n\nThe bread pudding was white chocolate macadamia nut with creme Anglaise.  It was OK, too.\n\nThe dinner never had any wow factor to merit the prices charged.  Things were average except the grits.  I thought the dried branches on the poinsettia on the wall by my table reflected the lack of attention to detail one would expect of a high end restaurant like Delmonico.  \n\nService was very good and the servers were friendly but I left feeling somewhat disappointed.  Well, at least there'll be no need to stop and peruse the menu anymore.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Dined their this past Friday, great experience. Service was terrific, food was \nSuperb.  Started with the signature barbecue shrimp which were tasty.   Good wedge salad. Streaks were outstanding.  My wife's came out a little rare and they immediately corrected. \n\nOn the must eat list for Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Really enjoyed this meal, after having a bad meal and service at a restaurant the night before (am doing that review next).  The service was amazing.  Our waiter never said no to ANY request.  He was phenomenal. I sure wish I could remember his name so he could get his proper kudos. The night was June 24 and party was in Gignac's name.  The steaks were cooked perfectly, his recommendations were right on point. I had the ribeye, without bone.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The service was wonderful. Lobster bisque was wonderfully creamy and the dinner role melted in my mouth.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We had drinks in the bar followed by dinner. The drinks were fine but the bar atmosphere is stark. The chairs are not comfortable and it just isn't very inviting. Our meal was excellent! We had bone-in NY and bone-in ribeye. The truffle potato chips are a must. Our wait staff was very good too..professional and helpful. Again, not impressed with the atmosphere. It has a big dining hall feel. Emeril often makes gluten free modifications but there aren't any here.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	After three years of waiting, I finally found myself back to Delmonico Steakhouse. Why did I come here out of all the other excellent steak houses on the Las Vegas strip?\n\n1 reason: Truffle Parmesan potato chips. they are like crack, you simply can't stop eating them :)\n\nI ordered the Certified Piedmontese steak, NY Strip steak ($60), grilled in olive oil, sea salt, roasted garlic and rosemary. At 16 ounces, each tender bite was worth every dollar.\n\nGirlfriend ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup and said it was very good.\n\nService is impeccable with a three person staff dedicated to your table and they make your experience worth the high price tag that is at Delmoncio!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Outstanding.  The bone-in ribeye was cooked perfectly and totally delicious. The bar has the best whiskey selection I've seen.  Service was prompt, and we had an amazing time.  Awesome meal, exactly as it should be.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I had the seared halibut with peas. It was very good and not dry.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Very proper waiting on you, we were one of the first to arrive. \n\nFood was excellent, most steak houses of this caliber are--if you're looking for a typical wine and dine situation this is the place. \n\nAmbiance was nice but nothing memorable.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We decided to pay Delmonico another visit after how successful our first experience was.  This time we only had a party of 4 (last time we had a party of at least 20).  The service of course was still great.\n\nWe started with the tuna/salmon tar tare - wasn't mediocre but still good\n\nThe men ordered the bone-in rib eyes and the ladies ordered the petite rib eye special - that came with a marrow/wine sauce over the steaks in place of butter.  My husband and I both ordered ours medium-rare, the other pair ordered theirs medium.  When we received our steaks, they ended up giving everyone the wrong steaks.  The other couple seemed to have enjoyed our medium-rare steaks though!\n\nWe ended our dinner sharing 2 desserts, the banana creme pie and creme brulee - both were yummy.\n\nOutside of our mixed up orders, we will definitely be back.  Their steaks melt like butta!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	To be honest it really quit aweful. First the host was uninviting. Sure not rude however I felt like I just walked into Denny's at 2:30 am for some pancakes. The wait staff was prompt however I would have rather been served by Denny's. They not nice and unattentive. They made us feel like it was best if we just hurried finished our meal. Of course we occommidated them becuase once started eating the food was certainly good quality but way over salted. It was very pasty. Odds are unless someone else insists I wont be visting again. Why when there are so many other great choices. One more thing. The restaurant really had no theme.  White walls coupled with the staff it felt like an expensive hospital cafeteria.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I really wanted to love this - I had very high expectations going in...unfortunatly, well, maybe I caught them on an off night..\n\nLet's start with the wine list - the night in question they were out of the slightly over $100 (inexpensive for the restaurant) bottle of Cab that I selected,  Not really a problem - found one that cost just a little more.  However, later in the meal one of the waiters informed me of another Cab (not on the list) that cost about the same as the one I originally selected but was much better than the one I ended up with. Why not inform me of this BEFORE I selected another bottle?  Strike one.\n\nIt was a Sunday night and I was informed that they were out of the special of the day - some sort of fish. Again not a problem as we came in for BEEF.  Just thought I would mention it...\n\nThe wedge salad - the bacon bits served with it were cold, greasy, and very tough.  Not good. The salad itself was fine - good blue cheese and nice and crisp- but for what you are paying the bacon should have been as well. Strike two.\n\nNow on to the steak.- the "signature" bone in rib eye. It was good. Very good in fact. - a huge cut cook just as I orded. But...it was kind of bland. Not totally lacking in flavor but still kind of bland.  Not bad, but not the best steak I had ever eaten.  My friend's filet was also very good - an excellent cut cooked as ordered but still a bit - shall we say?- unseasoned?  Call this half a strike.\n\nNow on to the pecan pie and ice cream thingy - yummy. Best part of the meal!\n\nAll in all, Emeril's Delmonico is not bad.  Just that I was expecting more...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had the ribeye bone-in with foie gras on top. The best steak of my life.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My family and business associates have visited Delmonico over the past eight years and in the past were delighted with the food (although we did notice some service slippage over the last couple years). However, the last visit in 2010 was a big disappointment. The food was just average and the service was terrible. My steak came to the table sans the melted butter and the server's solution was to bring a pat of butter several minutes later. There are too many outstanding restaurants for us to ever visit this restaurant again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Ask ten local 'foodies' to name their favorite Las Vegas Steakhouse and it would be surprising if a single one said Delmonico, and even more shocking if any of them knew that Chef Ronnie Rainwater had been working in that kitchen ever since the restaurant was opened nearly eighteen years ago, yet with family in town and a love of Emeril Lagasse dating back to the earliest days of his expansion to Universal CityWalk it only seemed right to sit down for dinner at the oft-overlooked space in Venetian's RR, a Tasting Menu showing that not only has the restaurant not lost its fast-ball, but that it has learned a few new tricks as well\n\nSituated at the end of a string of eateries nearest Palazzo, Mario Batalli's B&B across the way soon to undergo renovations and places like DB, Pinot Brasserie and others come-and-gone since Lagasse chose to bring his New Orleans Steakhouse to Las Vegas in May of 1999, those visiting Delmonico Steakhouse will first notice the large bar previously tended by Max Solano as they approach the space before checking in at a hostess podium, reservations quickly confirmed as General Manager Tuan Tran keeps a watchful eye over an expanse that can easily seat hundreds, the space divided into four different rooms with the most quiet off to the left with the walls lined in Wine and glass\n\nHaving previously discussed a degustation with both Chef Rainwater and Emeril's Director of Operations Mike Olsen, a fixed price arrangement allowing the kitchen total control over a menu that would be delivered in five courses to highlight Spring, it was after brief greetings from the Chef and a trio of waiters that were a bit 'stiff' but still pleasant that the meal got started, all dishes presented with a comprehensive description from Ronnie with the majority served exactly as they are if ordered a la carte, save for the entrée course and a smorgasbord of Dessert\n\nAlways tempting fans by way of daily specials via Social Media, as though the menu of Creole riffs on traditional Steakhouse fare from a culinary legend is somehow not enough, it was with a few of Delmonico's signature Pop-Overs paired to creamy, whipped Butter that dinner got started alongside snacks including the longtime favorite Truffle and Parmesan Chips plus crisp Cracklins made from Kurobuta Pork, the kitchen remiss to waste any part of such an outstanding Animal that is also involved in several other plates offered throughout the menu\n\nStarting light and working towards heavier items, the second course presenting two specials including Deviled Eggs topped in a big hunk of King Crab and a spoonful of Caviar alongside Burrata tinged in Black Truffles with a vibrant Spring Pea Pesto on top, those looking for something a bit more hearty would be well served to order a warm Spinach Salad topped in Praline Bacon and an Egg that is first lightly poached and then fried crisp before being hemisected, the bright orange Yolk blending with Bacon Vinaigrette to form a coating to each leaf that is slick yet light and acidic.\n\nHaving already experienced many Delmonico classics during two prior visits, but always happy to see the thick Bone-In Bacon with Root Beer Glaze and Pickled Watermelon land on the table, two seasonal plates saw a thick steak of Grade A Duck Liver cooked to caramelizaion on the outside with its smooth center offset by a Hazelnut pastry something akin to Baklava plus sweetness added by Berries; the Rabbit Porchetta wrapped in Prosciutto opting to go all-in on savory with the lean meat carefully complimented by Mushrooms and Pea purée.\n\nGetting to the Meat of the menu...or more meatier at least...it was for course four that the kitchen decided to switch up presentations a bit from the typical plated Steaks in favor a large round block of Pork, Beef and side dishes, the Pork Chop about as tender as they get with two Bone-In Ribs showing the Kurobuta Pig in yet another way while the two cuts of Steak were good, but unfortunately not quite on the same level as Jean Georges or Carnevino in terms or richness or texture, the sides mostly forgettable even though others on the menu sounded more innovative while Ronnie's Chicken and Waffles that used to be only offered at lunch again proved to be the city's best-even better than the one offered by Yardbird down the way-thanks to the great Brine, shattering Skin and spicy Glaze.\n\nAt this point quite full, but assuming the best was yet to come, it was in two large plates decorated with Chocolate that the meal came to its finish, a total of eight different Desserts including a few not yet even listed with highlights coming from all angles, both the Lemon Bar and Key Lime Pie tangy yet rich atop their respective crusts while the Pecan Pie and Emeril's famous Banana Cream version remain indisputable classics, the German Chocolate Cake sadly a bit dry while the Butterscotch Pudding was the sort of thing that almost caused a fight as diners tried to decide who would get the last, creamy spoonful.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Our party of six dined at Delmonico for my 50th birthday celebration.   In short, the service was outstanding!  Our head waiter was Michael and the manager on the floor was Vincent.   We also had at least two others who served us.  All were very professional and patient. Our party was not the eaisiest to serve that night, but what happens in Vegas...!\n\nObviously food tastes are very subjective.  My bone in ribeye and twice baked potato were great.  I did not care too much for the chicken and waffle dish my wife had... neither did she.  The shrimp appetizer was a 10, as was the crab dish.   The desserts... Creme Brulee, banana creme pie and chocolate cake were very good also.  Overall, a very nice experience.  We will return.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I really can't eat steak anywhere else in Vegas if I have the opportunity of getting a reservation here.\n\nBone-in rib eye, creamed spinach.  Delicious.  No complaints!!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Awesome Steaks! I have never seen a piece of prime rib so big! Nothing jumped out  at  me as exceptional but over all it was very tasty. Waiter was very knowedgable about the wine list which was a plus!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Dinner with my wife and 6 family members...no problem with reservations for this large part of a party.  Service was outstanding!  We all agreed that the steaks were some of the best we had ever eaten!  Seafood tower was very good!  Sides were very tasty and the creamed corn was SO GOOD!  Not sure how they prepared it, but it was some of the best ever.  Will definitely include this restaurant in our future visits to Las Vegas!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A trip to Las Vegas just isn't a trip to Vegas without a stop at Delmonico. So I think I've been to Delmonico six or seven times and the operative word is consistency. Always great service, always great food and just overall my favorite steakhouse.\n\nSo what isn't to like about Emeril's house of meat?\n\nA very well stocked bar, a nice wine list and perfectly cooked steaks.\n\nI started with the lettuce wedges with fresh blue cheese and got the rib eye. I don't know how they do it but the steaks always have this crispy, char on the outside but have a good juicy center with lots of flavor.\n\nWe shared the grits, corn and mushrooms as sides and they were tasty good.\n\nLike I said, this is a special occasion place and Delmonico has yet to disappoint. \n\nThanks Emeril for always making my trip to Vegas!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My husband and I have enjoyed Emeril's restaurants. But when we tried Delmonico's, it was unbelievable. We had the best meal ever. It's worth the money. I think it's the best of all Emeril's restaurants. I have no more words, speachless. You all should to try it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Lissa G and I stopped in for lunch.  We've been meaning to go to Delmonico's for years since we are often in Las Vegas and always stay at the Palazzo.\n\nWe ate at the bar and watched some of the New Year's Eve college football game.  I think the volume was on the TV but we really couldn't hear it, hopefully other times they just have some music playing.\n\nI was kind of mixed on the food. The French Onion Soup is a must try! The broth was so deep and rich that you could taste the hours of preparation and simmering. The Tomato and Burrata dish was fine, as was the Ribeye Steak we ordered. Again, not bad, just ok when I compare them to their competitors in the hotel, like Carnavino or Bouchon where we often go for lunch.\n\nWe will have to try dinner next time but if you are going don't miss the onion soup!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	tries to be sophisticated, but it is average at best.\nMaybe if you are used to Burger King this joint is awesome, but it is just an average steakhouse.\n\nBTW: the men's WC door lock doesn't lock, so everyone that wants to go to the crapper will see you in the throne....
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I ate here years ago.  I had a nice meal but I don't remember much.  I went back last week with my husband and another couple. The steak was wonderfully done.  It has a wonderful feel inside the restaurant - big and airy.  We had the tuna and salmon tartar to start then shared the bone-in ribeye.  It really was good.  I'd go back in a second.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Located inside my favorite hotel Venetian, Delmonico is one of Emeril's restaurant. When you walk in, the decor is very minimal but sophisticated with arched ceilings that makes you feel like you're inside a European gallery. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n-Deviled eggs: delicious! Very creamy, topped with King Crab meat is a plus.\n-truffle potato chips: good sharable appetizer. \n-New Orleans style barbecue shrimp: if you're into Cajun style barbecue shrimp, definitely order this dish. A bit different from the ones we had in New Orleans but still good. \n-Lobster bisque: has good amount of chunky Lobster meat, but not the best I've had. \n-ribeye: due to pregnancy, I had to order a well done steak. My steak came close to medium well, pink in the inside. I sent the steak back, it came back still not completely well done. Sent it back for the second time and the steak came back as beef jerky.. I expected at least the second time around for them to make a new one as I know the effect of cooking a piece of steak multiple times. Of course I wasn't expecting a well done steak to be juicy and tender but I have had a properly cooked well done steak before that's was not super tough! Flavor on the steak was pretty good, but could not taste the dry aged flavor as much. In the end, the restaurant took this off the bill, which was a nice gesture. \n-sides: Creamy corn (very good), mushrooms (a bit salty but good flavor), twice baked potatoes (good). \n\nOverall, I would give this restaurant 3 and a half stars.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Definitely a fan of this place. Reminds me of a cross between my local favorites Ruth Chris in Irvine, Ca & Mortons in Santa Ana, Ca. Great service of course, awesome wine selection. Came her for my 40th & knew I was going to have steak so I went with their bone in ribeye & it was definitely not a mistake, no steak sauce necessary & never should need it at a good steak house. I'm never partial to chicken at more expensive places (I just don't see the point, may as well go all out & get the beef) but my wife had their roasted chicken & I had a taste of it & it was the most flavorful chicken dish I've ever had. I may just have to go against my favorites & get that the next time. All in all this place should be a 5 star but I've only been there once, I may adjust once I go back again in the new year.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Deserves a zero. I was highly disappointed. We went for my husband's birthday expecting a meal worthy of the $200 we spent.  The food was very bland. I was so upset I didn't even bother to order dessert.  I thought if dessert tastes anything like dinner, I'm not going to bother. Noone bothered to ask how the food was. The chef didn't bother to come to our table,  even though he spoke to individuals at the three other tables surrounding us. Thank God I opted for the indoor gondola ride after dinner which helped to improve my mood for the evening.  I won't be back here or to any of his restaurants. I'm a good person so I still left a very generous tip;  after all it wasn't the waiter's fault the food was just ok.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The bone in rib eye was delicous and the cream of spinach and the grits and bacon sides were flavorful.  This is a huge slab of meat and I had a hard time finishing all 18 ounces of it.  The only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 was because of house expensive it is.  I'm all about quality at an affordable price and I would only go again to this place for like a 10 year anniversary.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	As far as steakhouses goes in Las Vegas, you can almost never go wrong if you're willing to pay $50-75 for a steak for the most part, or at least maybe I've been lucky.\n\nDelmonico's is a solid restaurant, which for me is highlighted by Emeril's Banana Cream Pie which features Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings and Whipped Cream.\n\nI've gone to the lounge seating area just to indulge in a slice of their Banana Cream Pie, so if you love pie, and BCP, then you've got to find the time and make room for this...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We went in with high hopes after a friend recommended Delmonico but we left just a bit disappointed.  The ambiance was really nice and we were given a great table without a reservation but the food left a little to be desired.  \n\nMy friend and I both started with lobster bisque, which was good but a little thin.  We noticed right away too that she had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in hers, but I had almost an entire small claw.  I was happy until I realized it was tough and rubbery.  I actually had to use a knife and fork to cut it into bite sized pieces.  My husband ordered the wedge salad as a starter and it was 80% white/yellow core.  Not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.\n\nI ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  Maybe I have high standards, but I think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  I didn't really care for the seasoning either, but that's a personal preference, not something I can count against the restaurant.  My husband's rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice baked potato.  I had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.  \n\nOur server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  When we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of "Emerel's Blend" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.  \n\nMaybe it was an off night, but I really expected more from a $400+ dinner.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The Gist:   The most expensive steak does NOT equal the best tasting steak.     \n\nPlayed in Vegas with a group of 8 other friends.  Even though there is so much good food to choose from in Vegas, all of us knew we wanted to go to a nice place for some good steak during our stay.    We've heard a lot of good things about Delmonico so it was pretty easy decision to try it out.   \n\nFirst things first.  Service was great.   We came late for our reservation.  No problem.   Some of us actually shared a couple steaks.  No problem.   Took pictures for us during a busy Saturday night.  No problem.\n\nThe important thing - the steak.   With 8 people around the table we were able to try various cuts.   Several guys got the bone-in rib eye.   One of the girls got the rib-eye, and I personally shared the new york strip with a friend.    I feel like I'm paying a premium for Vegas and/or Emeril.     Don't get me wrong, you'll definitely get a nice fat, juicy, flavorful steak here.     But I felt like I was getting more of my money's worth with the Kona Crusted Steak at Capital Grille (Chicago) or the Cowboy Cut at Taste of Texas (Houston).    The meat quality was much better and believe it or not, much more flavorful than Delmonico's steaks.\n\nThat being said, if you do go to Dominico's, definitely get the sautee'd mushrooms on the side.   Its a nice garlicky mix of mushrooms that compliments perfectly with the steaks!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I love fine dining and this place exceeds expectations. Went for my birthday, boyfriend and I had the truffle potato chips, amazing. Could have ate like 5 orders of them they were so good. I ordered wagyu fillet. Best steak I have. Flavor amazing, melted in your mouth and was just insanely good. Bf got the strip I think...? Or ribeye haha don't remember but whatever it was it was great too. We had twice baked potatoes, great. And the duck egg crème brûlée, great except the sugar was a little too hard and tasted a little burnt in spots but that's the only complaint. The service was beyond amazing too. So attentive and very nice. Will be coming back here often
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Wow...was super disappointed by my dinner here. A buddy said he had the best steak in his life here, but unfortunately that wasn't anything close to my experience. Everything we had was sort of meh...\n\nStarted with french onion soup...steakhouse staple right? Wrong...it didn't have much flavor and was pretty one dimensional. Limp, flaccid, no flavor onions.\n\nMy steak...prime, dry-aged rib-eye on the bone. After being schooled by the waiter on how "they cook their steaks" and what medium rare means. I get a medium well steak instead of the medium rare that i ordered. What a waste of a good piece of meat or at least I assume it was before they over-cooked it.\n\nCreamed spinach - another steakhouse classic they can't screw up right? It's got this weird taste and texture, not sure what it was, but didn't even eat half of it.\n\nVery disappointing, really not worth the $$$ or even the time unforuntately. Don't bother.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	5 STAR PERFECTION!\n\nWow, what a treat. I went there as just one person and was seated in a booth by myself and was still given excellent service and attention as I would expect. I was expertly consulted by a sommelier on my wine choices to go with my $50 filet that was cooked to a perfect medium rare. All in all I had a $120 five course meal with two glasses of wine. Some may think outrageous, but hey its Vegas and I didn't have a problem splurging a little bit. Enjoy yourself - this is 5 star perfection for service.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Food was delicious!! I had the salmon with the  potato hash, my girlfriend had the chicken and waffles. For sides we had the cheesy grits and asparagus. LOVED the popovers.\n\nThe service was weird... our waiter was knowledgeable and professional but seemed preoccupied, always looking around while talking to us. There was a group at the table next to us and he seemed much more attentive to them. \n\nAnother waiter came over at the end of our dinner and we asked what spice was used in the waffle- he said he didn't know. I then asked where The Dorsey was in proximity to the restaurant, he said- again, I don't know........ he didn't even attempt to answer our questions. Great food, less than adequate service.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Hands down the best steak I've ever had, the bone in ribeye was amazing! I loved the garlic mushrooms and the twice baked potatoes too. Not only was the food perfect but the service was phenomenal. My friends and I popped in off the street with no reservation and not dressed up at all. Even though we completely stood out, we were shown to out seats immediately and we didn't get one dirty look from any of our 3 waiters!  I will return to vegas in the future if only to eat here again!!!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My first review on yelp. Only reason I'm doing this review is because of Delmonico's Steakhouse at The Venetian. We were tired of the average buffets and fast food and we really wanted to have a fancy night. So we looked up on yelp for a nice fancy restaurant. We decided on Delmonico's and called in to make reservations for two at 530. Came 530, we were still at the pool, so we called in and pushed the reservation to 630. Staff accommodated us, which was surprising. We came to restaurant at 630 and were seated immediately. The staff are on the dot with their reservations. Right after we were seated, the waiter asked what we would like to drink. I ordered a usual neat Johnny Walker Black Label and followed it with a 7&7. I believe every man should learn to love whiskey. My lady ordered a water lol. We then looked at the menu. I read all the reviews on yelp and just jumped straight to the assortment of steaks they had available. My lady ordered a New York T Bone Steak and I had the filet mignon. We also ordered the Butternut squash ravioli for the appetizer and mashed potatoes to eat with the steaks. \n\nFirst came ravioli. It was 5 pieces of ravioli. My first thought was,"Damn I'm getting jipped out of 15 bucks" But when I bit into the first piece of ravioli, I literally had an mouth orgasm... No homo. It was the best ravioli I ever had in my life. Hands down. I wish I had a whole plate full of it. My lady was hella impressed as well. \n\nThen came out the steaks. I hade mine cooked medium rare and she had hers done medium. The first bite was the best. Succulent, tender, easy to chew. Best steak I ever had in my life.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went for lunch waited almost five minutes for any type of service (was not busy). Ordered appetizers chips and gumbo they were very good. Then the\n bad. We ordered two burgers one medium one medium well. Both came medium rare at best. Sent them back, they put the burgers back on the grill. Came back mine was supposed to be medium well was medium. My wife's was supposed to be medium was medium rare. Both came back on blood soaked buns WOW.  We were disappointed. It did get better the pecan pie with ice cream was very good.  Also our server was very nice once he came to the table. So for the poor burger and blood soaked bun I have to give three stars.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Thinking of what to say, I find it's hard to stay on track and remember that I'm reviewing a meat 'n potatoes steakhouse that doesn't go out of it's way to be too fancy or adventurous, it just strives to make good food in a nice environment. \n\nI think a little is lost if you forget Chef Emeril's philosophy; watch him on TV, the guy just likes good food.  Remember Erik, you didn't eat at Bouchon or French Laundry... you didn't go on a magical food adventure.  You had a steak.  A damned good steak.\n\nThe ambiance is nice; dimly-lit, full-service, white-linen business casual kind of place.  The wife and I had good, attentive service, and our head waiter was a treat.  He was incredibly accommodating and helpful.  I had fun listening to him give the table next to us tips on eating in Vegas, steering that couple away from Tao ("A nightclub that happens to serve food.") and Cut ("Way too salty and LA pretentious for my taste.  Maybe they've toned it down... the salt, anyway.")\n\nWe started out with two appetizers, as we usually do, our favorite Emeril's New Orleans BBQ shrimp with petite rosemary biscuit, and to get into the steakhouse mood, the wonderful truffle and parmesan potato chips.\n\nMy wife had the filet mignon medallions crusted in mushrooms with a pan sauce, don't remember of what, and I had the 9 oz. filet mignon with a small pad of maitre'd butter, cooked to a warm, pink, bloody center.\n\nBoth were EXCELLENT.  For dessert, we capped our meal, and ourselves off with Emeril's banana cream pie and the pecan pie.  I had a single jamaican blue mountain courtesy of cafes richard.  \n\nThe food was excellent, service was spot-on, and atmosphere was great, if a tad noisy.  Unfortunately, the authentic Kobe filet I had at Fish House spoiled me on steaks forever, so as good as Delmonico is, I can only muster 4 stars.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This was my third time at an Emeril restaurant, and once again I left feeling that paying $85 to eat dinner was perfectly justified.\n\nAppetizer: The traditional New Orleans gumbo.  Smokey, spicy, warm, and comforting.  \n\nEntree: Filet mignon, medium.  Crusted with just the right amount of spices, cooked to perfection, and crowned with a healthy pat of herb butter.  \n\nSide Dish: Country smashed potatoes.  Clearly filled with more butter and cream than I care to think about, skins left in (love that), and just melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  \n\nMy friend's side dish: Bacon & cheese grits.  I normally don't like grits, but these were nice and well...gritty, not runny or gloppy.  Add bacon and cheese...c'mon.   \n\nDessert: The best part of the meal.  Wait--probably the best part of my entire Vegas trip.  Warm pecan pie with an oatmeal shortbread cookie crust, topped with homemade vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.  Just...wow.  The pecans were chopped into manageable pieces, the filling was not overly thick and cloying, and I could have eaten the crust by itself and been happy.  I had a taste of my friend's chocolate bread pudding, which was gooey and intensely chocolatey, but not too sweet.  (It tasted like a combo of semi-sweet & bittersweet.)\n\nDrinks: Pretty good.  They don't have a specialty cocktail list since they are very into being a traditional steakhouse, but my pineapple martini was nice.  \n\nDecor: Very bare bones- the plain beige walls have no art on them, but that allows you to notice the very ornate architecture of the place, with high ceilings and arches everywhere.  I was too into my food to really care what it looked like though.\n\nService: As always with Emeril's restaurants- impeccable.  We had no less than 3 people taking care of us at all times: one to take our orders, one to bring our food, and one to take it away.  \n\nTip: SHARE an entree.  I split the 9.5 oz. filet mignon with my friend and I'm glad I did.  The average portion is enough for 2 or 3 people.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	If you're looking for craptastic service and mediocre food at caviar prices, check out the Delmonico inside the Venetian!\n\nIt started with the cocktail waitress who was so sassy it became bitchy, snipping short responses when our client asked a question. Then came our dinner server who was borderline rude. "Are your seafood options listed here the only meat-free options you have? Most of them have sausage or some sort of meat in them," I inquired. "Yep," was all he said before moving on... didn't even offer to remove an ingredient or help me out in any way.\n\nThe food was pretty tasteless. An heirloom tomato salad had the most bang for the appetizer buck, but at $18 for four slices of tomato and a splooge of burrata, I could concoct a very similar version from my local farmer's market for a fraction of the price. And it's not that price is that huge of a factor here; if you're going to Delmonico you are aware of the beefy tab that will come at the end of your meal... but when the service spits you aside, it's not worth it.\n\nIf you're wondering why two stars and not one - the second star is for the wine list, which shone brighter than the boring white walls inside this sub-standard steak joint.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Surprisingly very mediocre, considering I had heard such fantastic things.\n\nThere are many things that could be talked about, but at a steakhouse like this everything should be coming back to the hunk of dry-aged beef in front of your face. It should be flavorful, seared to just a tad crisp on the outside, and it should be consistent.\n\nMy steak was almost reasonable. My buddy's steak next to me (same cut) was left half-finished on the plate (overcooked and just generally not awesome).\n\nThe ambience and service was great, but if you can't get the steak right...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Everything on the menu is made with a little bit of heaven, a pinch of happiness, and two cups of love. Must try the lobster bisque !!! It's so amazing I considered asking the chef to have my children.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Amazing service and delicious food!  Steak cooked perfectly.  Sides were all yummy!  The biggest baked potato I have ever seen!  All sides are sharable portions!  Wait staff kept my water glass refilled, this is extremely important to me, as that is all I drink.  Noisy atmosphere, but there were 7 of us, so not bothersome.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	BAM! Sorry for the cliche, but Emeril hit the nail right on the head with this one. \n\nBAMtastic service, BAMtastic food, BAMtastic atmosphere and a guaranteed BAMtastic experience!\n\nBeen there many times and I'll be BAMmed if everything hasn't exceeded expectations!\n\nNormally I would include tips for what to order and why. This time I have just one recommendation. Eat here. This is by far the best dining option between the Venetian and Palazzo. Now BAMit, make your reservation, enjoy and you're welcome! Lol!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Best steak of my life!  We stayed at Aria over the weekend and asked around for a dinner recommendation.  Hands down this place rocked!  The service was amazing, the food was fantastic..... I am an Emeril fan so I was excited to try it out.  The prices was very reasonable especially for being a top rated Vegas strip restaurant. Excited to try the other locations in NYC and NO now!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great service, great decor and ambiance, but food was weak.  Wedge salad had undercooked, fatty bacon on top. Roast duck was over-done, not juicy, but skin was rubbery.  Lots of folks do it better than Delmonico, keep looking.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Awesome place to eat. Steaks were amazing and so was the twice baked potato. The star of the night however was the table side caesar salad. The large croutons were the best we have ever had by far.  The drink I had was the b.b.s and it was great. Our server John was great as well. We will be back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I really don't get why so many people think this place is that great.  \n\nIf you remove the Emeril-factor, It seems like a place in the midwest where guys go w/ thier buddies after a day on the course.   \n\nServers really know how to push the signature dishes.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I ate the duck and it was nicely done. The other people I was with had steak and salmon.. They also enjoyed their meals.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The lobster bisque was wonderful!! Ahi tuna was a tad fishy.. But still edible. Service was nice. I didn't really appreciate the seating... Since we sat next to a cleaning station. Not impressed. Wanted something equivalent to mastros but it wasn't even remotely close. It just looks nice but tasted... Mediocre. The ribeye would of been better if I made it myself. They were seriously off their game.. Was hoping to be "wowed" but I definitely had better.. This isn't a must have. Only eat here for convenience if you are staying at the hotel.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Perhaps my expectations were too high.\nLet me start off by saying, the hype about their 16 oz Bone-in Ribeye ($52) is well deserved.  It's flavorful, has exquisite marbling, and served at a medium rare perfection.\n\nBut that's where the hype ends.  Sure, the lobster bisque is good and the shrimp appetizer is tasty, but for what we paid overall, I know there are better options here in the city.  \n\nSo, I would say to you -- go for their Bone-in Ribeye and leave all other expectations behind.  It's a great meal, just didn't make it to my list of favorites.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've been to this location twice over the years.  This is located in Palazzo in the walkway towards the venetian.  Both times i ordered the bone-in rib eye, and both times it was pretty good.  This latest time i ordered Medium-Rare, but it was definitely more on the medium side.  I should have been more upset it wasn't cooked exactly how i wanted it, but it was still good.  \n\nFor dessert, i was pretty excited to try the Banana Cream Pie, but it was pretty average.  It had  A LOT of bananas and didn't really blow me away with flavor.   It was like eating a big banana with whip cream.  I probably wouldn't get it again.  \n\nThe service was pretty good, but i wish they didn't sit us right next to the kitchen entrance.  It gets annoying to have people constantly walking by you with food and dishes.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I recently stayed two nights in Vegas. I went to B&B one night and Delmonico the second. The food was excellent quality at both places. But the service and the atmosphere fell very short at Delmonico's. I was dining alone so maybe the server didn't think he needed to attend to me but the night before I had amazing service at B&B so I had an expectation of what a $100 dining experience should be like. \n\nI told the server I would like a glass of red wine when my steak was delivered. I waited ten minutes before it was brought out. I used to wait tables... for a decade. I'm a reasonable patron. I think fine dining demands something above diner level service.\n\nSo despite a delicious steak and a tasty martini, the rowdy classless crowd and the crappy service will keep me from coming back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Came here for my 21st birthday with my family. Was almost the best steak I had in my life. We also had some good wine.\n\nCame back here for a 2nd time recently with my sister before we headed off to a concert, and it wasn't as good this time. Not sure what it was. Portions are large, and prices still relatively expensive, but it just didn't sweep me off my feet like the first time.\n\nBut it still gets 4 stars. Folded napkins each time you leave your seat. All good.\n\nAnd my sis will prob remember me eating the leftovers in the hotel room after the convert. Ahahaha.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico is my new favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas! Everything from the first glass of water to the banana cream pie titillated our taste buds! The filet mignon was glazed and cooked to perfection. The sautéed mushrooms were bomb. I couldn't have asked for a better meal!\n\nAdditionally, the service was fantastic. The guidance from our server was honest and perfect and our wine and water glasses never dipped below half full!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I have eaten here many times during my trips to Las Vegas. Each time, the service and food is impeccable.\n\nMy husband always orders the steak, I the\nTartar. The tarter is the best I have EVER had.\n\nAlso, make sure you order their pecan and shortbread desert--my favorite desert I've ever had in a restaurant. Cheers to Emeril for making this spot excellent from start to finish.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This has to be one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Been there many times and each time it is fantastic.\n\nThe food is really excellent. Some of the best steaks you will ever have. There has been nothing ive had here that has been short of excellent. Its traditional, with a hint of cajon for some little extra spice and flavor.\n\nSome of the best service of anywhere in Vegas. I always love when the food is served to the entire table at one.\n\nIf I am in the mood for steak, I would pick Delmonico. Emril knows what he is doing with this one.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Superb!\n\nI'm sure people can knock off stars if their steaks didn't come out to their liking (heck I would too), but all four of ours came out exactly as we wanted them to.\n\nI'm not a big fan of Ermiril's show, nor am I a fan of his personality.  Despite having his name associated with this restaurant, I feel that if he's not the one cooking my meal, then it's not really his food.  Whoever the chef was that night sure had his mojo going that's for sure.\n\nThe cocktail shrimp appetizer was amazing.  Cocktail shrimp you say?  How different can that be from Bellagio's buffet where you can get like 1000 in one sitting if you wanted?  Well considering you're saving your stomach for more desirable substances, the dish contained eight snicker bar sized prawns drizzled with a fine cocktail sauce that had a nice kick to it.  It was more than enough to satiate us before the main course.\n\nWhen our meat came out, my buddy and I couldn't stop drooling.  The girls had to laugh as their softball sized fillet's looked more like golf balls in comparison to our full-sized cow bone-in Rib-Eyes.  Literally the size of the plate itself, and at least 1.5 inches thick....Vegans would run in fear at the sheer size of this holy beast.  The rib eyes were cooked perfectly throughout.  Medium-rare, a beautiful mix of pink and red with a perfectly charred (requested) exterior that seared all the juices in and added wonderful flavor to the aged meat.  If this wasn't a proper meal we would've gone to town on the bones like cavemen at the end.  Truly magnificent.  And to think, they were offering a "Generous Cut" Porterhouse on the menu as well.....that might have been size of.....two cows (40-50 ounces per what our waiter quoted)\n\nThe sides were just as delightful.  Served family style, the Asparagus was grilled perfectly, the potato fingerlings roasted with a beautiful blend of butter and garlic, and the mushroom medley was bursting with flavor.  I will also add that the dinner rolls are probably some of the best I've ever had.  Soft and fresh hot out of the oven, they had a nice sweetness to them and the fresh churned butter added an exquisite country taste as well.\n\nDessert consisted of an excellent bread pudding with a scoop or Oreo ice cream, along with a Banana Fosters cream pie.  Both were amazingly good.  I have no idea how we stomached them, but they were a nice finishing touch.\n\nThe wine list is extensive and amazing.  They're one of the few restaurants in Vegas that serve one of my favorite wineries wine (Neal).  We had an absolutely dazzling bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, that we had to order another.  Needless to say, both gentleman slugged down 75% of a bottle each.  : )\n\nThe service was excellent.  our waiter was attentive at all times and was very alert to our needs.  The best waiters are those that know what you want without even having to signal or tell them, and our waiter was just that good.\n\nA very elegant setting and located in the walkway connecting the Palazo and Venetian, this is definitely one of the steakhouses in Vegas I will frequent again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've been here a total of three times.  All great experiences.  Their filet mignon, new york steak, and bone-in rib-eye were all done to perfections!  The cuts were thick yet so soft when you eat them.  Hats off to their chefs.  The steak were done so perfect you really don't need to dip the meat in sauce or butter, etc.  It's so flavorful as is.  Pricey?  Yes very.  Which is the only reason that might keep me from frequenting this restaurant as much as I would like to.  I don't think they have a dress code.  But, I would recommend dressing up a bit when you go here.  Otherwise you would stand out and be embarrass like I was one time.  Happy eating!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico in Las Vegas by Emeril Lagasse is not as impressive as I would expect it would be. First we are given a really lousy table in the corner as if my husband has been very bad that he deserve to be punished in the corner(considering this is his special day-b-day). Waiters are clueless, they are just standing in the middle but most of the time really doing nothing that in few ocassions I have to pour my own wine in my glass. The head waiter is the only one who seems to be working and who do know what to do here.\n            We are given a small apetizer courtesy of the chef bec of my husbands b-day which is a good touch, I love this little appetizer (not in the menu, wish it was there because that would be the only highlight of the evening) a concoction of smoke chicken with couscous with a little spices, the taste is all balance and in harmony.\n           The fried green tomatoes appetizer is bland, whatever coating and sauce they put in there didnt help at all.  The spinach and raddichio salad is soaked on its own dressing which you cannot even tell which dressing it is, salads when presented are supposed to be crisp, so make sure you only put the dressing when it is ready to be eaten, very disappointing since the head weater gladly recommended this dish.\n          My husband ordered Bone in Ribeye Steak, huge, cooked perfect but no taste or seasoning at all, it would need some sort of sauce to make it appetizing.  Filet mignon is OK, just like any other filet mignon, nothing great about it.\n         Luckily there's one dish that is worth mentioning, the potato gratin dauphineous, excellent, potato perfectly cooked, not much cream, hint of garlic and toasty top, excellent!\n        Going back? No way, very expensive and I'm not happy.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My friend and I really wanted to try one of the best steakhouses in Vegas, and people kept telling us about how great Delmonico was, so we gave it a try. It was my friend's birthday dinner and she is a huge meat eater, I on the other hand don't actually like steak all that much, but WOW! It is absolutely impossible not to enjoy your meal here. \n\nWe were in a rush because we had tickets to a show and we were already running late. We advised our maitre d' that we had barely one hour to eat dinner and be on our way. He went above and beyond to make sure we got service fast and made the show on time. Not only was he absolutely efficient in making sure our food came out quickly, but he was also super friendly and attentive with us. \n\nOur cocktails took no time at all to arrive and were done perfectly. We didn't have time to get appetizers which was a big disappointment, so we went straight for the main course. I had the rib eye and smashed potatoes, my friend had the fillet Mignon and fingerling potatoes, and we also shared some buttered asparagus. All the food was top notch and delicious. My rib eye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was well seared on the outside. Like I said, I don't particularly like steak but this was mind blowing amazing! I had a few bites of my friend's fillet Mignon and it was melt in your mouth goodness. I don't know that it could be possible, but it was even better than my rib eye. Amazing. \n\nThe sides were also very good, specially the country smashed potatoes which were buttery and creamy. They had bacon and what I think were leeks in them. Yum. The asparagus were cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. I did not try the fingerling but my friend said she wasn't overly impressed by them. \n\nMy friend was also surprised with an apple cider sorbet and a candle - for her birthday. The sorbet was delicious, light and refreshing. All in all our visit to Delmonico was fantastic and worth every single dollar we paid. Dinner here is pricey, but seriously if you find yourself in Las Vegas, you'd be crazy not to come here!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The steaks were very moist and tasty.  The service was not the best.  It was early in the evening and the place was not packed so to wait for 20 minutes for a steak seams a little too long.  Either way, that evened out to being about average for a place that was pretty expensive price point.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had dinner reservations at 6:30pm and we were seated right away.\n\nI looked at their menu prior to stepping foot into the restaurant so I kind of had an idea of what I would like to order.\n\nFor our appetizer, we ordered two Parmesan and Garlic potato chips. I'm a chip queen....obsessed and in love with chips but this....this didn't taste that great. =/ The first five chips were good...but after awhile...it tasted WAY TOO GREASY. You know that over greased taste? Yeah...that's what I was starting to taste. It felt like they drenched the entire thing in oil and left it there for days. My party finished the first plate of that but we just couldn't finish the second plate. I definitely would NOT order this again. \n\nNEW ORLEANS GUMBO: This gumbo had rice, chicken, sausage and veggies. Pretty good sized portion for a bowl of soup. Small eaters would be half full from this. Seriously...lol. I thought to myself...damn...I hope I have enough room in my stomach for my entree!!!\n\nCAESAR SALAD: Typical normal Caesar. It's big enough to share with your entire party.\n\nBONELESS RIB-EYE: You have your choice on the menu for bone-in OR boneless rib eye. I was with a fancy date and his party of four other high rollers so I didn't wanna make a mess, that's why I opted for boneless. I've got to admit...it was good...but to be technical, I would rate it at a solid B grade. My rib eye was cooked to my liking, the flavoring was delicious BUT......there were more fatty parts that I would like. =/ eh...not a big fan. But it didn't take away from the complete meal. Great rib eye...big enough for leftovers the next day.\n\nNOTE: Three out of the six steak entrees my party ordered was over cooked. Someone wanted medium rare but her steak came out medium. My date ordered medium and it pretty much came out medium well.\n\nFor our side dishes we ordered potatoes au gratin, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and another veggie dish.\n\nCan't go wrong with Delmonicos. Def give it a try! Be sure to make reservations.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	hands down the best steak I have ever had. Frog legs were really good too. Service was perfect and it made for an amazing evening.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went there for my father's 80th birthday.  Excellent.  My parents both ordered the fillet mignon, which was very flavorful.  The butter on top helps.  I got the fillet medallions.  I found the sauce and crust to be slightly too overpowering on the fillet, but it was still very good.  Our waiter, Frank, was very personable and made us feel right at home.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We recently came here for our second time for our anniversary. We were craving a seafood tower and we had liked this place before and we were in the Venetian. \n\nWe sat in the bar and had a wonderful server. Very personable, accommodating and very nice. The atmosphere is still the same great upbeat, fun and relaxing (yes all at the same time). The drinks were good as well.\n\nThe thing that lacked was the seafood tower. The highlight of the meal, the thing we were looking forward to the most, what we were drooling for. A couple of the dipping sauces were delicious but their substitute for cocktail sauce tasted like marinara sauce. Overly sweet and not a good mix with shrimp. Maybe I am biased because I love the kick of horseradish in my cocktail sauce. The biggest complaint though, was the seafood felt dry or freezer burned. We still ate it because I wasn't going to let them waste the food and was in too much of a good mood to complain, but for the $, maybe I should have. \n\nSo this trip was a love hate. We got way better service but the food lacked and isn't that what should rock my world at a restaurant of this caliber?
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The service here is great and so is their steak!  I had the ribeye steak here and it was SOOO good!  There was so much flavor in it and i havent tasted a steak like this in a lonnng time.  It was really cooked to perfection the way it was cooked.... words cannot even describe.  I wished I could have steaks like this more often. \n\nThe waiters were also so nice.  We had a show to catch and they made sure we got outta there on time.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	You're in Vegas what else do you expect but excellent cuisine from a world famous Emeril restaurant? Yes this place is on the pricier side, yes the portions are huge, and yes its an upscale place. But you pay to play in Vegas so that is exactly what you receive here. The service was nothing but superb! It didn't matter if you're a big wig celeb, or just a family for wkend trip they treated every patron with the exact same excellent service. \n\nThe menu is pretty much full of steaks or some selections of pasta and seafood. Pretty much all items are ordered Al a carte in addition to your entree selection. The majority of us had the highly recommended bone in rib eye. OMG you will know with your first bite why this aged piece of steak is $52! It literally melts like butter in your mouth! The seasoning was spot on with that perfect caramelized crust. I would definitely recommend the rib eye if this is your first time here! \n\nThe must have side dish is the Creamed Corn Gratinee: This has the consistency of cream of corn yet has the crusty top of your usual gratins. It's has a delicious sweet yet savory flavor profile that just makes you wanna come back for seconds. The only negative is its $11 for that little dish. But again you pay for the quality instead of quantity here.\n\nThe next must have dessert is the banana cream pie! It's quite literally 8 layers of banana slices staked high! This reminds you exactly of what a banana cream pie your grandma used to make at home tastes!  This is quite the perfect way to finish off your meal or share with a date/friends. \n\nWe will definitely be visiting again on your next Vegas trip. But yes you'll need to save up for this one as your wallet may cry once you see the bill!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great service.  Perfect bone-in ribeye steak.  Just so nice.  Service is consistently good over the years.  This is Las Vegas' best if not the world.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Ok, this would have to be one of my favorites!! The food is delicious and wine as well. But seriously, nothing can beat the service at Delmonico's. We had 2 servers and they were both soooo attentive to everything we needed.  Hands down best steakhouse in Vegas, if not best restuarant. Highly, highly recommend reservations.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Good food.  Great steak/beef tartare (did I spell that correctly?).  Pretty darn good service as well.  From an ambience standpoint, this place is leagues better than Prime (not too many tables, decent lighting, not a lot of room noise) but not as cool as some of the newer rooms in Vegas.\n\nAll in all, a good place to go for steak.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I had one of the best meals I have ever had in my life at this resturant! We started with the barbecued shrimp which was amazing. Then I had the lobster bisque soup. This soup was fantastic! I love lobster bisque and this was by far the best bisque I have ever had! For the main course I had the filet minion crusted in wild mushroom bacon and topped with parmesean. OH My GOD! It just melted in my mouth. The service was amazing, the food was fantastic. A bit pricey but worth every single penny. I will definately go back next time I'm in town.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Not worth the money. It was not that great, food was just plain. I had Rib Steak and New York. It wasn't cooked the way a wanted. I had to send it back. They recooked the same piece. And it came up dry with a big slab of unmelted butter on top to cover up. Almost made me sick. Not worth the money not even close
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	So my buddies wanted to go to a legit steakhouse in Vegas and we decided to try Delmonico.  We shared the seafood platter for an appetizer and how can you go wrong with king crab, oysters, and lobster.  I ordered the gumbo and it was delicious and full of depth and flavor.  The star of this dinner was the bone in Ribeye!  Perfectly charred on the outside and so tender and moist in the inside.  Best piece of steak I have had in my life, so far. Lol  I'm not a fan of fat on steak but the fat on this steak melted in my mouth and was as close to steak butter as there is.  My friends ordered sides but the steak was so big I didn't have room for anything else.  I think we ordered to much food and we had lots of leftovers. I could have shared the steak and I would have felt perfect.  This place is expensive but worth every penny.  If you feel like treating yourself this is a great place to eat.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We've tried qutie a few steakhouses and restaurants in Las Vegas and I think this is one of our favorite in Vegas.   Their steaks are so much more flavorful, tender, juicy and just cooked perfectly.  We've tried many hyped up ones but they fail to meet our expectations. with Demonico, we were not disappointed at all. \n\nthis is off topic but since we are talking about steakhouses, stay away from "the cut" restaurant at palazzo, not good, not worth it. see my review on it if you need to.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Lobster bisque, spinach salad and wild mushrooms.  Yum, yum and yum.\n\nRibeye.  Large portion perfectly med rare, but too "saucy" (not sure why they feel butter is necessary on such a flavorful cut that should be able to stand on its own.)  Truthfully, I've had better ribeye on our backyard grill.\n\nLamb.  Overcooked and also too saucy.  Not sure what that flavorless choux puff was about...\n\nTook two bottles of wine, but only got charged 1 corkage.  Nice.\n\nIf I ever go back - which I doubt I will - I'll stick to the non meat items.  Guess for a steak house that's not high praise....
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	solid experience for dinner. grits were very good as a side as was the tuna and salmon tartare for appetizer. ordered bone in NY strip which was $46. was good, though perhaps a bit more fat than i prefer. wine menu very extensive, like 130 pages long or something.....
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	What an experience!\nI made reservations for my friend and I. We had dinner at around 6:30pm on a Sunday. We were seated right away. \n\nThree servers were helping us, and they were very attentive throughout the night. \n\nOur meal started off with complimentary bread. It kind of reminded me of yorkshire pudding. It was really light and airy. I liked it because it didn't make me as full. \n\nBoth of us ordered the bone-in rib eye cooked medium rare. It was cooked nicely, and it had nice flavors. I didn't realize it while I was eating, but the steak was really salty. I couldn't stop drinking water all night. We also ordered the wild mushroom side dish. This can definitely use less salt. To end our meal, our server gave us a birthday dessert- blueberry sorbet. Because we were so full, we ordered the banana cream pie togo. It was boxed nicely and I was able to enjoy this dessert later that night. It was delicious, but if you don't like bananas, don't get it. \n\nIt was an overall pleasant dining experience. I would definitely come back and try other dishes.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Service was fantastic. Food was good, but it really didn't hold a candle to the other food I had in Vegas this weekend. I had the chicken breast entree and the potatoes it came with were exquisite, but the chicken breast was really not as moist as it could have been, and I was a bit disappointed. Was expecting more from Emerile.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	One word my friends: tableside!!! Yes, tableside carving of your steak chateaubriand for two/Creekstone farm steaks never disappoints. One of the best dinners I had this year for sure.  I would recommend Delmonico restaurant in Vegas who ever goes to Vegas or lives there.  \n\nDelmonico is settled within the Venetian hotel and with a 5 pm dinner reservation , they were pretty busy by 6 pm. I'm assuming people want to eat good streak before different shows and other entertainment in Vegas. Service was impeccable with the server and assistant both working harmoniously together.  The restaurant is not overly pretentious or glamorous looking.  I liked the overall atmosphere with the white walls/crisp white tablecloths on the tables with dim lighting.  \n\nThe service starts with the complimentary brioche bread and butter which were decadently heavenly.  Then they entice and educate you about their wine list etc but I don't drink so I was ready to order some steak, steak, steak! I did the chateaubriand steak for two carved for us.  It was a 18oz steak but really my 9 oz share was big but so yummy so yes I was able to finish my portion.  The garlic smashed potatoes were delicious.  The creamed spinach was just ok, a bit of a let down.  \nOther than that I enjoyed every minute of my dinner before my red eye flight back to Florida.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My now fiancé took me here to celebrate after he proposed. I swear my starry eyes didn't affect the taste, it was incredible on its own. \n\nStarted with delicious Krug champagne and oysters. I really appreciated quality oysters after having some sub-par ones the night before at a buffet. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque and I should have too. I ended up having a bit of his, it is NOT to be missed. We almost put in another order. \n\nI ordered the filet and he the bone-in ribeye. Both were delicious, and even though they are famous for the ribeye I liked the filet more. It was so lean and tender, cooked perfectly medium rare, but it was that charring on the outside that gave it this incredible flavor. The ribeye was fantastic too, it had a completely different flavor. My man preferred his ribeye so it worked perfectly. Honestly can't say a bad thing about either. \n\nThey sent us a house mad sherbet to celebrate our engagement, and we finished with divine espresso. \n\nMy fiancé and I agree this was the most delicious and flawless meal we have shared. We will definitely return every time we come to Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We started out with a cheese and prime rib fondue with pretzels which was outstanding.  The portion seemed small, but was very filling for an appetizer.  \n\nI ordered the NY Strip and ordered the potato cakes with onions as a side.  The steak was nicely cooked but really lacked flavor.  The best part of the meal was the potato cakes with onions.  I honestly was hoping for a little more BAM.\n\nDessert was a disappointment for me.  I ordered the chocolate cake and it was more like a fudge.  I only ate a few bites.  My wife loved her dessert, I just can't remember what she got!  \n\nService was ok... but seeing the service other people got made us realize it was probably just our waitstaff that was lacking.  Other tables actually heard the specials and their waiter made suggestions.  They received sauces with their steaks, we did not.  When I asked our waiter for a dessert recommendation, he basically read the menu.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Make sure to book a reservation!! Even with our 8:30 rez, we didn't get seated until 9:10. \nThey were very accommodating though so I can't complain! The bone in rib eye and buffalo was TO DIE FOR. I was looking forward to the lamb based on the pictures that I saw, but it wasn't on the menu when I went there over the weekend. \nBread + butter... Best.Ever.\n\nI cannot wait to go back and eat there again!!!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This absolutely by far is my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas. I went here again on my 29th birthday, and the service was amazing as always. I ordered the ribeye to share along with the best lobster bisque you will ever have. Also the truffle potato chips are to die for. The restaurant is very classy and a bit pricey, however, you get what you pay for. I've tried pretty much all of the restaurants at the Venetian, and I have to stay this one is my absolute favorite. The steaks come out a perfect medium rare cooked to perfection in butter.\n\nSince this is a popular restaurant, I highly recommend making a reservation in advance. It's a nice restaurant to take a date as well as to celebrate a special occasion.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The best choice for steaks in Las Vegas.  The staff are expert servers.  I have gone here for both intimate dinners and group dining, and all experiences have been beyond our expectations.  Start with the truffled parmesan chips, then the tomato salad, the mushrooms, the filet (black and blue of course), one of the potato specials, and stay for dessert (they sell cigars in the bar) and a glass of scotch to finish off the meal.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I would give Delmonico a 2.5 or even more if it was available but as it's 2 or 3 unfortunately for them I have to go with 2. There were so many pluses for the meal that I feel bad about rating the restaurant low. However, the overall experience was not what I wanted, and for a  meal of this price I have pretty achievable expectations.\n\nFor starters, the sevice was immaculate and I mean truly immaculate, the servers work as a team and they we're amazing. From recommending wines to full descriptions of food, and even drinks, they were aces. The wine list had so many rare and amazing finds that you could get lost searching, thankfully the staff was able to help us pick out one perfect for our tastes and meal. For the appetizer, bone in bacon, we'll if you didn't think it would be absolutely amazing by the name I can promise you, words do not describe how amazing this appetizer is. It truly is memorizing. Try it, and you'll understand. \n\nFor dinner I had a filet and he had a bone in ribeye, their signature cut. Unfortunately  my husband had to send his steak back due to being substantially overlooked. Again, the waitstaff immediately addressed the issue and apologized agreeing with my husband that not only was the steak overlooked, but it was substantially overlooked, ie, the steak was ordered medium rare and came out between medium well and well.\n\nThe waitstaff removed the steak from the table and after a few minutes brought my husband a second steak, most notable on the second steak was the fact that the steak butter was not melted, leading us to believe that the  steak was brought directly from the grill to the table, no time to rest under a lamp and overcook itself, a plus we thought. Until my husband cut into the second ribeye, again their signature steak, again substantially overlooked. At this point the server, who was speaking with my husband about the meal and appologizing about the previous steak appeared appalled that again, the steak was substantially overdone. He appeared embarrassed for the issues. We were promised no matter what it would be made up for and even the manager immediately addressed my husband and appeared completely appalled that the steak was so overdone, for a second time, (this time closer to medium well, maybe a high medium, but still nowhere near medium rare.) \n\nThe manager and server traded apologies and promised to make things right. Due to the fact that I had only had half of my filet, my husband opted to not receive another ribeye, instead choosing to just finish my meal. The server and manager happily took the ribeye off and purchased us two desserts for the troubles and issues. \n\nFor the good, the menu is amazing. In it's entirety, I believe it rivals some of the best steakhouses around. The lobster bisque is by far the best I've had, and as a fan of lobster bisque, I've had it at several 4 and 5 star restaurants all over the United States. Presentation, flavor, texture, everything was amazing. \n\nThe bone in bacon, if I didn't convince you before, it is one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever had, the watermelon is a little strange sounding but brings out so much flavor that again, I just can't put it into words, you have to experience this dish!\n\nMy filet oscar was great, perfectly cooked, very flavorful and perfectly seasoned. I just wish I had a second stomach to finish it after almost licking the plate of lobster bisque and bone in bacon. \n\nDesserts were great as everything else, and the after dinner drink list is as expansive as the wine list. If you can imagine it, they have it. \n\nMy only issue is my husbands meal, again I feel bad because I understand mistakes happen, but it was very unfortuonate that for a dinner to celebrate our first annivarsary, at the end he/we were disappointed. He continued to describe it as "the food was amazing, but not what I was hoping for." \n\nI personally have issues with a $300 meal (granted $130 of it being an amazing and perfectly reccomended bottle of wine,) being disappointing in any way. Again mistakes happen and I believe firmly that they are rare at Delmonicos, but I cannot change this disappointing experience. \n\nIf this is the only negative review that you read please do not discount this restaurant. Again, mistakes happen, and even as I write this, I feel bad for not giving the restaurant better ratings because so many things were good and accidents happen, but it doesn't change the experience tonight. Hopefully, as it appeared, this will be a rare experience and we may give this restaurant another shot the next time we're in Vegas, but as this was supposed to be a special meal celebrating, I will say disappointing is the best way to describe it. The restaurant has so much more potential and obviously could have done so much better than we experienced, we were just unlucky. Again, no fault on the waitstaff, they were amazing, but overall experience was disappointing. I hope others have better luck than we did.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We were seated promptly for our 5:30 p.m. reservation on Monday, 12/29/2014. Front of house service was exceptional. The food took a while to make it to the table, which was a little surprising as the restaurant was not busy. My wife loved her filet. My bone in ribeye was good, but by far not the best I've had. The meat was over fatty. The sides were very tasty, including the asparagus and the twice baked potato. I would go again, but I'd order the filet instead of the ribeye.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is mine and my fiancé's favorite steakhouse here in Las Vegas! We often stop in and see our favorite server, Michael Jackson, who simply completes the fine dining experience for us. He is always so pleasant and knowledgable about the menu and suggests amazing dishes each time! I have never been disappointed here and will be back soon!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We had a memorable dinner celebrating our anniversary at Delmonico Steakhouse having our usual classic choices plus some signature Emeril dishes. The service was everything that you would expect from an Emeril restaurant plus more with Chef Rainwater and staff rolling out the red carpet making the night special for my wife and I.\n\nGreeted with congratulations on our anniversary at the host stand, we were seated immediately for our Thursday night 8 PM reservation along the wall in the classy main dining room. A nice touch that we noticed toward the end of the meal was that although the restaurant was almost at capacity, no diners were sat at any adjacent table leaving us secluded for the entire meal. We had a few bonus tastings added to our meal including two complimentary celebratory desserts. And at the end of the meal, the friendly manager who was overseeing our entire meal, escorted us to the kitchen where we had a brief word with Chef Rainwater and photo op.\n\nIf you're looking for a cocktail, check out their creative list which some of the drinks looked very interesting, but I just stayed with my Irish whiskey. The wine list is also extensive enough that they carried a couple of choices for my picky wife. Emeril mainstays such as the barbecue shrimp and banana cream pie are items that you should try at least once. The poached main lobster was a special for the night that did not disappoint. The highlight for my meal was the bone in ribeye with Creole seasoning topped with maitre d' butter. I savored every bite of the dry aged beef and I don't think there's much doubt that I could have eaten another one.\n\nThe tab was just over two bills which I had no problem with the splurge and felt it was well worth it with the gracious hospitality we received. You'll find your classic steakhouse dishes at Delmonico but you'll also see some twists with Creole influence. You'll also be assured that the service will uphold the Emeril standard.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Yes Yes Yes! I'm probably repeating all the great things people said already but it is true. My husband and I were there this past weekend and we were satisfied 100%! And after reading the reviews I'm not sure why people minus the 5th star because of the price. In my opinion if you are looking for an amazing fine dining experience you must be wiling to spend the money. We were here for about three hours and we enjoyed every bit of it. We let our waiter know in advance that we were in no rush and he made sure to plan the timing of our appetizers and main just right. We were watching the blue man group after dinner and wanted to drink a few drinks before we left.\n\nEvery time we went to the bathroom they folded our napkins, refilled our drinks before we even had time to ask, and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu --- that alone just shows the attention to detail. In addition to the lobster bisque, french escargot, cream corn gratinne, creole gulf shirmp cocktail...:) I had the hot Alaskan King Crab Legs and my husband had the Bone in RibEye. He said "it is the best steak he has ever had" ( please take in consideration that we had travel all over the world).  The noise was moderate, besides I'm in Vegas and I wanted to dine in a lively and happy place not a quiet boring place.  Even though the dining room was open it is still cozy and romantic and easy to have a private conversation.  \n\nIt has become one of our favorite places to go and we will definitely come back again!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place is a little gem.  Yes it is very pricey but the service combined with great food make it a great place to dine.  We had the NY Steak and Rib Eye along with the truffle chips, buttered broccoli and the chocolate cake. First the service is impeccable five star all the way.  The hosts have only a few tables and are very accessible while not being overbearing.  They have assistants that are every bit the professional as the hosts.  Was treated very well.\n\nThe food is amazing.  The steaks are quite large and bone-in meaning great flavor.  I think better than Ruth's Chris even.  The sides were good the truffle chips are highly recommended!  and the pop-overs that they start with are good if not a bit heavy.  \n\nThe chocolate cake was also great.  The place is pricey for sure but you get what you pay for here.  Highly recommend this place for a great experience!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My experience at Delmonico Steakhouse was well-above average, but not as fantastic as I thought it would be.  First off, although we had made reservations well in advance, we had to wait over 20 minutes for our table.  All was not completely lost, however, since we passed the time in Delmonico's classy little, modish bar area where we got started on our red wine for the evening. \n\nThere was a bit of confusion amongst the servers shortly after we were seated, and we experienced a delay in receiving our selection of bottled waters for our table.  At Delmonico, they give you the option of choosing from a few types of bottled and mineral waters for an additional charge, or you can request just regular,complimentary tap water. After the initial delay, our water glasses were refilled continuously throughout the meal, however. \n\nLike most five star restaurants, at Delmonico Steakhouse, you receive service from several members of the waitstaff, which ensures constant attention and most of your dining needs are met without even having to request anything.\n\nThe interior of the steakhouse was minimalist, with tables covered in cream colored linens and simple, modern brown leather chairs for seating. The space had a slightly Mediterranean feel due to its coved ceilings.  No doubt because the restaurant is located inside the Venetian Hotel, they wanted to maintain a slightly Italian theme througout. \n\nThe restaurant, which was was packed with patrons, was also very loud.  I think the coved ceilings were extremely conducive to the noise level contained in the dining room.  This combined with brighter than desired lighting, created a slightly less intimate dining experience than were were anticipating.  \n\nThe food was very good, however.  We started with the crabcake, and it was tender, buttery and delicious.  Followed by that, were our iceberg wedge salads with bacon, blue cheese and all the yummies.  Hubby ordered the bone-in ribeye, and I ordered the bone-in NY strip, both were cooked to medium perfection.  For sides, we shared a huge, delicious baked potato with sour cream, bacon, green onions and cheddar. For dessert, we shared the caramel creme brulee, and it was very, very good.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal very much, and we would return here again for the food.  Our experience was just was not over-the-top fabulous because of the noise and lighting factors.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The food was decent, but the service was definitely sub par (especially for the price!).It took 15-20 minutes for the server to acknowledge us  just so that we order drinks. Our dinner was good but I have to say that I was disappointed that they did nothing to acknowledge my birthday celebration. We chose this restaurant over STK & CUT to celebrate the occasion and I wish we hadn't. They did nothing to acknowledge our occasion which was sad. I will not be going back to this restaurant again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I'll start with this: I'm not a fan of Emeril Lagasse.\n\nWhy? I don't know. I've never really been a fan. When Food Network showed actual shows instead of Guy Fieri and his 90's hair, Emeril, Bobby Flay, Tyler Florence, and Giada ruled the network. Oh, and Michael Chiarello, but I've been to his restaurant and that was phenomenal. That aside, BAM! was the most popular saying in the food world, people flipped their shit over it, and now Emeril has his face on every cheaply made saucepan and spice around grocery stores for twice the markup. I always thought he was off-putting.\n\nThat being said, this is a seafood/steakhouse, and it's upscale. I've been to CUT, so I know that Wolfgang Puck is better than his canned soups. There's a chance Emeril would live up to the (very pricey) hype.\n\nThe drinks were good - a cab and a pinot noir were actually quite nice, and the cocktails looked amazing. Maybe your bar staff can teach your kitchen staff a little something about pride in their product.\n\nFirst up: the vine-ripened heirloom tomato salad with burrata. Am I supposed to eat through the thick, rock hard center of this tomato? Are you serious? I paid $20+ for a salad that consisted of five slices of heirloom tomato and a dollop of burrata on top, and you're going to give me several slices that were pure unripened tomato? Fuckin hell. I was disappointed. Okay? So disappointed. Come on, how fucking hard is it to serve a RIPE tomato?\n\nFor the entree we ordered the wagyu ribeye and the ahi tuna. The tuna was fine - it was tuna. I'd opt for two pieces, as pepper crusted seared ahi for me can get overwhelming after a while (nigiri is a totally different situation). The battered mushrooms were a nice touch, as well as the sauce.\n\nBut the wagyu. Okay, look. You're paying $90 for a fucking steak. For a steak that ISN'T KOBE - please, for the love of god, don't confuse the two. And it's not big, it's small. Is it wonderfully marbled with fat? Yes! To me, it was great! I thought it was wonderful! But this is why my review just went down a star while writing this:\n\nWhen you pay $90 for a goddamn steak, you'd better bring it out hot. Like, searing hot. Like on a 400F plate like Mastros, hot. RIGHT off the goddamn pan hot. When it comes out just barely hot anymore, and then slips right into lukewarm, what the fuck? What kind of $90 experience is that? The cow has given it's life, with the production of so many people trying to make it wonderful, and you RUIN the experience. Plus it was a little too salty.\n\nYou're probably thinking, "Jesus Jaime, you're a bit of a prick, and a snob. I can see your brain from how high you're holding your nose from here."\n\nYeah, alright. I'll give you that. But you know what? I'm not going to pay fucking $90 for a goddamn steak if it isn't treated PERFECTLY. I can get a $25 steak that's handled better than that, I don't give a fuck if it hasn't been drinking beer all its life.\n\nThen, to top off the evening of great disappointments, I ordered dessert. How HARD is it to fuck this up? When you have a great meal, you want to finish it with a bang, right? So you have the one thing on the menu people like (apparently the banana cream pie), and then fuck it to the rest of the dessert menu, right? For fucks sake people, GREAT dessert isn't that hard! It's SO EASY. Even worse, it's the biggest profit maker! If you call that Chocolate Truffle Cake a CAKE when it's drier than the Sahara desert, and that Strawberry Shortcake as such when there was barely any actual shortcake, AND the strawberries were mostly unripened with green parts on them, with a dollop of whipped cream on the side of the plate...then you should send your Pastry Chef back to school because clearly they need a kick in the ass.\n\nThis is an expensive meal where they prey off the idea that the people who come don't have any appreciation for the things they serve, so their level of care goes right out the 37th floor window of any hotel on the Strip.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Apparently finding a high-end restaurant on the Strip that serves lunch is more difficult than I thought. With many spots only open for dinner service I opted to dine at one of the few with a lunch menu -- Delmonico.  \n\nWe started with the wild arugula salad -- shaved apple, candied walnuts tossed in champagne vinaigrette with a trio of artisan cheeses. It was a large portion that they split for us.\n\nMy wife had a steak panini served medium rare on ciabatta. The accompanying horseradish was overpowering, but the beef was still excellent. The sandwich came with some amazingly crispy and light truffle fries.\n\nThe lobster sliders I ordered was a small order of two. The Maine lobster was lightly dressed with a citrus aioli and celery leaves, helping make this some of the tastiest lobster you'll find in any sandwich in town. The Old Bay fries that they came with were tasty, but not nearly as good as the truffle fries. My only complaint about this dish is the size. Something this delicious shouldn't be constrained to two sliders per order.\n\n4.5 Stars
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I had fillet, it was wonderful.  Great service, nice atmosphere.  The sides were pretty good, especially wild mushrooms:) The chef overcooked my BF's steak, so they quickly offered him a substitute.  Great wine list:) Enjoy!!!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This review is where I am sorry that you can only assign 5 stars because there are not enough stars to convey how much I adored this meal.\n\nThe atmosphere is perfect in noise level, pleasing color palate and space.  You are relaxed when you eat here.\n\nThe staff is welcoming and prideful in the job without sounding pretentious, the perfect blend of professional and friendly.  \n\nThe food-OH THE FOOD- the spinach salad, basically heaven on a plate,  tender spinach with a well balanced sherry vinaigrette and praline bacon pieces.  Let's just say, I was sorry that I offered to split it.\n\nThe filet and bone-in rib eye (our selections) were grilled to perfection, and I mean, perfection!!  Don't let the creole crust intimidate you, it is not overpowering and they're not ruining a beautiful cut with "stuff".  The twice-baked potato was hearty and delicious.\n\nThey will suggest the banana cream pie, which looks great, but I chose the pecan pie in an oatmeal shortbread crust.  This was so beyond fantastic in its tender and unique crust to the mellow nutty sweetness of the filling.\n\nI could seriously go on and on about this meal. I love to cook and I love to eat so it is a perfect evening when I feel like there is nothing I would change about the meal or think that I could have saved a ton of money and cooked myself.  Those thoughts NEVER ran through my mind.  So, next time I am in Vegas, I will return as soon as I get off the plane.  cannot wait.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've had better BBQ shrimp at other Emiril's places, sauce here seemed over cooked, perhaps slightly burnt. Steaks were crazy expensive ($50!) and nothing special.  Sorry.  I can get a better steak in Houston (where I'm from) at a dozen or more places for half the price.  I'm sure the meat was high quality, and it was cooked properly... but it just wasn't anything special.  Not worthy of the $ anyway.  Service was a bit obsequious as well (which got annoying).  Overall it was a nice dinner, but for not a good value for the $.  There are many steak places in LV now, I'll try something else next time.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This was the steakhouse we decided to grub after my half marathon on the strip. I was concerned that my race attire didn't suit the ambiance and when we entered, we were welcomed. COOL! \n\nThe staff was outstanding and very informative of the menu. We were led to a private corner booth which made our dinner even more special. We were offered menus and an iPad for our wine selections. I ordered a champagne to celebrate my last race of the year, and the fiancee ordered a glass of Justin cab (one of his faves).\n\n-We were offered comped bread (popover) and butter. LOVE THE SOFT BUTTER!!! \n-Lobster bisque to share ($16)\n-Bone-in ribeye ($55)\n-Bone-in NY Strip ($50)\n-Twice Baked Potato ($9)\n-Duck Egg Creme Brûlée ($11)\n\nSteaks had a great rub on it and was topped with butter. YUP butter... Because I had the rib-eye, there was a lot of fat! YUM!!! I was only able to eat half my steak since it was so huge!!! The fiancee finished his NY. The potato was average and came with all the fixings on the side. I just wanted extra butter. Dinner was great.\n\nThe dessert was a bit disappointing. We ordered the duck egg creme brûlée since it was unique and highly recommended. At first the dessert was good, but after eating a couple more bites, the dessert started tasting a bit funny. It was so rich and I think the weird taste was getting to our tastebuds! Too bad there wasn't a molten lava cake!\n\nService and ambiance was superb. Love walking through the Palazzo to get this restaurant! Beautiful!!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico is a Mecca for meat lovers!\n\nFrom experience as a frequent guest, I can attest to the top the quality of the food and the service. We love the bone-in as well as the foie gras.\n\nDelmonico also has first-rate and premium wine lists that can go from conservatively priced to thousands a bottle.\n\nGo ahead, enjoy the place!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	So me and my wife went here for our 20th wedding anniversary. It was Valentine's and I had made the reservation online. Well, we got all dressed up (for us,lol) and arrived about a minute or two before or 530 pm reservation and were seated within a couple minutes. The ambiance was great! Just what I was hoping for on this special night. So we peruse the menu and I decided to get the bone in ribeye and my wife selected the bone in NY strip. Both of which were touted as dry aged. We also got the buttered broccoli and potatoes augrautin. \n It took a good 30 minutes for our food to come out and were given 2 pieces of bread which were light and tasty. The servers waiting our table did an excellent job of keeping our water topped off. And when our food was ready a small army of servers marched up and placed everything almost simultaneously. They all were impeccably dressed and very attentive and polite. \n Well, now to the really disappointing part which is also the most important. The food. I'm a foodie. And in particular a steak connoisseur. This was in my opinion the worst dry aged steak I've ever had. Not even to mention at this price point. I've had better steaks at any number of chain restaurants. It came drenched in a marinade and was full of gristle. I honestly believe we were served a cheap choice or select cut instead of dry aged prime for which we paid. The sides were OK. But the steaks were bad. And when shelling out over $150 for it needs to be an amazing meal. Do I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone. And the only reason I didn't make a scene over the poor quality of our steaks was I was try desperately to salvage our special dinner. \n Emiril, step up the quality control!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Ohhh where to being....maybe I should start from the judgment from the host? Probably not a good idea to rudely look at people when they enter. Or maybe you shouldn't have a server who asked a personal question about my tattoos? Or maybe when he tried to get me and the 5 other girls to go to his part time job at TAO, then proceeded to ask me if I had another shirt because "I don't think they'd let you get in with a wife beater," because I'm wearing a tank top that isn't up to your personal standards. Hmmmm as an ex server there is NO WAY IN HELL I WOULD EVER TALK TO ANYONE LIKE THAT. Maybe in this gentlemans mind I am not good enough to be at his job, where he works to get paid, to probably help raise his family. Let everyone know beforehand that their is a prerequisite to even be acceptable in this restaurant. Yes I can wear tank tops, and yes I'm a woman I have breasts but to be stared down and then judge how I'm dressed is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE.\n\nMy entire dining experience was ruined. Why would I want to spend $134 on some wine and food just to be judged? For that I leave the server no tip and I promise I will never tell anyone about this restaurant based on experience alone. My friends told me how great it was and after 10 minutes I was embarrassed and self conscious. Thanks for wasting my money, time and what could have been a good experience. I cannot fathom how these people get trained...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Pork Chops looked amazing although, I don't like pork chops... The guest who had them said one of the best they've EVER had... I ordered salad and the jumbalya- it was good, not fantastic...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A very disappointing experience overall. We went there for New Years Eve 2011/12 and were very disappointed to find that there were no decorations at all, and nothing had been done to bring out any kind of party atmosphere. The food was OK, but what really let the restaurant down was the service. Our waiter did not know the cocktail list. We had to spell the names of the cocktails we wanted for him to be able to order them for us. Same went for the wine, and once we got the wine, he didn't poor it for us a single time throughout the night, not even to taste when he first opened the bottle.\nClearing the table was slow, and no one came to offer dessert, coffee or anything else after we had finished our main course. Getting the bill also took some time, and not a single person acknowledged us when we got up to leave, not a "thank you" or even a "good bye". We felt like we were being ignored, or forgotten, as we could see the people at the table next to us being looked after a lot better than we were. There was no reason for them to treat us this way. I work in service myself and I always make a point to be nice, pleasant and polite when at a restaurant, and if an honest mistake is made, I am normally very forgiving, but this was too much. We expected much better and I would not recommend this restaurant at all.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We Came For The Ribeye! You Should Too!\n\nWe'd heard the accolades about the Bone-In Ribeye at Delmonico's and decided to see for ourselves. Of the eight in our group - seven of us ordered the Bone-In Ribeye - the eighth ordered a Filet.  Bottom Line - Everyone Was Pleased.\n\nThe cuts were ample.\nThe cooking-temperatures perfect.\nThe flavor excellent.\nThe texture exceptionally tender.\n\nOf note also, was the table-side Caesar Salad. For sides we kept it simple - ordering fries and mushrooms - both were excellent. Another winner was the Banana Cream Pie.\n\nService overall was accommodating and highly attentive. \n\nThe room itself is a little bland - and the lighting system rather ugly - but hey - you're here for the steak!\n\nRecommended!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is my third time I would say in the last 6 years that I have eaten here. Celebrated my brother-in-laws 30th birthday and the STEAKS were awesome. I had the bone-in New York steak medium. It had a perfect char and cooked how a steak needs to be. I am a big fan of the New York because it is a leaner cut. The bone-in Ribeye steak medium rare was what my brother-in-law had and that just melted like butter in your mouth. The creme of corn was outstanding!  The Smashed potatoes were fine. Overall experience was superb and the service has never failed me.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had an outstanding dinner last week. It was over the top. The dry aged prime grade bone in new york was the best. try the banana cream pie. will be hard to eat out after that service.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Located in the Venetian, this place like all the other Las Vegas spots is real swanky, as opposed to the usual clubby feel (dark woods, naugahyde booths) that most steakhouses have.\n\nThis place has a really tasty steak, the Delmonico. It's a bone in rib-eye that's really tender and tasty. Sides were unremarkable.\n\nI'd do it again, it's a nice place.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Note to Vegas douchebags (all of you): when you are planning a dinner at a well known restaurant that's oozing stars and dollar signs, Ed Hardy is not considered dressing up. This is my splurge dinner on this vacation. I'm writing this at the table - key tones off of course, keeping it classy. I had a reservation for 9:00, got there 5 minutes early, and waited 25 minutes. Not unheard of, but neither is an apology or a "thank you for waiting." I also felt a little ignored as a single diner not ordering alcohol. My soda glass sat empty for a long time before I was asked if I wanted another. This happened twice, once between appetizer and main course, and once when i had a third of my steak left. No mention of whether I would be charged for refills, but either way that will be factored into the tip.  Either assume that I would like it refilled and don't let it hit the table empty, or show some sort of bottle or other indication that I'll be seeing $4-5 each on the bill. I also didn't appreciate the lonely roll that was deposited on my table. Just because I'm by myself doesn't mean I don't want a little basket of warm rolls to scarf down at my leisure. I was asked if I wanted another after I was done, and I declined. It was also brought out at the end of the appetizer, which indicated to me that it had been initially forgotten.  My appetizer was completely delicious. I am sad to inform you that it was a special and may not be there when you dine. It was lump crab and gnocchi. Pesto, brown butter, lemon. The crab tasted like Dungeness, the best of course. The gnocchi was toasty and so delicate that I could have eaten it with a spoon like ice cream.  Next came the rib eye, medium, and creamed corn gratinee. The corn was good. The topping was crispy. The steak was definitely closer to medium well than medium. I expect a $50 steak to be flavorful and cut like butter. There were bites that I felt I was choking down. I also found it to be underseasoned. When I asked for sauces, I was given three options. Bearnaise, Emeril style A-1, and something muttered of which I only heard worcestershire. I think it might have been just that. I opted for the E-1. It didn't solve the seasoning issue and I found the taste odd.  The verdict is in on the diet coke. It was three dollars and I was not charged for refills. Why keep asking then?  I don't see how that could be considered elevated service. I had a much better meal and experience last year at SW at the Wynn. I will not be back to Delmonico.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Steak was very tough. Surprising for $55.00, I had the Ribeye and my son had the NY strip. Both the same. Flavor was unusual. Atmosphere was good roll's were spectacular and twice baked potato was also very good. Overall would not return.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Once again Emeril's Delmonico has lived up to its world class reputation! We took our friend and her husband here last night for her 40th birthday and the night couldn't have been more perfect! \n\nStaff/Service - exceptional! I think every person on the staff we interacted with wished her a happy birthday and even brought out a small dessert at the end of dinner. The sommelier stopped by our table several times and selected a great bottle for the table. He even came back at the end of dinner to talk about what Texas wines we recommend. Truly exceptional service. \n\nDrinks - you have to try one of their Sazeracs. \n\nFood- blows me away how exceptional the food is here. Ribeye was cooked absolutely perfect medium rare. Charred on outside. Perfect seasoning.  Duck fat fingering potatoes were also delicious. \n\nCouldn't have been happier to visit Delmonico and can't wait to go back!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	this place hasnt change a bit in their service and the great tasting steaks. every time im in vegas i be sure that is one stop i ALWAYS make...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My new husband and I just got married in Vegas on the 4th of August, and we went here on the 6th to celebrate during our vacation. We called for reservations on the day of, and they were able to accommodate us. When we arrived early, we sat in the bar area, and we had the most amazing drinks we both had ever had. I had a "green spade" which had cucumber, basil, and some other stuff in it. It was light, not to sweet and delicious. He had a bloody orange, which is a whiskey cocktail, and he loved it equally. I also had a limelight, which was good, and the best was the dark roast....delicious, smooth and incredible. They were about $14 a piece, and worth every damn penny. We were seated 15 minutes early. We told the waiter that this was our first "casual fine dining" experience, and he was more than informative. Made suggestions throughout the meal, and was personable and forthcoming. They had a nice "Our top Picks" for the wine. We chose a mid-price cab sav. They gave us complimentary truffle cream for an app, and then we ordered the tuna to go with it. The tuna was just average, but we live in Cocoa beach, so it's hard to impress us with seafood. The main event was the bone-in ribeye. I have eaten a shit ton of steak in my life....and DEAR GOD. This steak was impeccable. I didn't need a knife, I used my fork to cut it. The seasoning was just right, and I ordered mine rare, and that was how it was. My husbands was just the right medium rare....and perfect. Now, the only negative part of our meal. I ordered fingerling potatoes and asparagus as our sides. I had to send the potatoes back. They were nearly raw, and dry. The asparagus was edible, but boring. At nine dollars a piece, I expect a little zing. We were too full for dessert, but I'm sure it was great. The service was perfect, three waiters to a table. I was impressed with our overall bill total. They gave us cards that detailed where we sat and what waiters we had, so that we could have the same ones next year when we return for our anniversary. I will def be willing to return for another beautiful, whole experience.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I ate here way before I actually knew what fine dining was and when I would laugh over getting two tiny crab cakes for $12. In retrospect, it's a delicious gourmet establishment with a small menu that features a lot of variety - which I find to be extremely rare. \n\nThe service was excellent and the staff was patient with us asking questions about the food. The environment was very relaxed and there was plenty of space between each table so you felt like you had a bubble around your table. \n\nThey don't allow flip flops! but they didnt say anything to me...its just on the bottom of their business card :)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A great steak dinner in the Venetian/Palazzo resort on a cool desert night on the Las Vegas Boulevard--It does not get any better than this.  Do not miss the gumbo, and tomato salad for starters.  I love the bone in ribeye, and the bone in prime rib.  I have not been to Delmonico's in quite a few years.  As usual Emeril Lagasse's  restaurants never disappoint me, I once again enjoyed my meal.  The ribeye here is beyond compare.  For dessert do not miss Emeril's banana creme pie--my all-time favorite dessert.  BAM!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Marginal at best.  No atmosphere, bare cream walls.  One bathroom, not too clean for a large restaurant.  Maybe it was an off night, but I found it not great at all.  I have read all of the reviews and I dont get it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	It's so sad that what made this place so memorable was that it was so mediocre... and that my travel buddy and I got into a heated discussion while trying to decide who's "fault" it was that we ended up there. We finally remembered how it happened - we were at the Palazzo and she wanted steak. I wanted to stop at Cut, but she wasn't a big fan of Wolfgang Puck. She likes Mario Batali, so we glanced over Enoteca's menu, but of course - they didn't have steak. If we'd known of the existence of Carnevino, we probably would've ended up there. I don't know if the steak would've been better..... but anyway, this is about Delmonico. \n\nBy the time we ended up in front of Delmonico's Steakhouse, we really were famished. It's Emeril's steakhouse - couldn't possibly be awful.............\n\nWe ordered:\n* A BOTTLE OF RED\n* JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKE\n         - [4/5 - Good crab cakes - not the best, but definitely took first place over everything else we had.]\n* GRILLED FILET MIGNON MEDALLIONS\n         - [3/5 - It was alright. Average in flavor, not tender.]\n* FILET MIGNON\n         - [2/5 - She's a huge steak fan but first, they overcooked her steak - then sent her a second steak, which was still not much better and a little chewy.]
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great ambiance.  Heirloom tomato salad appetizer was perfect way to start.  Steak was perfectly cooked and superb flavor.  Desert was delicious.  Not a cheap place, but worth it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We wanted to catch a little Sunday Football while enjoying some great food. Our original plan was to spend Football Sunday at Lagasse's Stadium. But, we were greeted by a line of about 15 people waiting to get in.  Not too bad. But in the 20 mins we were there, the line never moved. "Sports Bar" or not, I should have known if it bears Emeril's name then a reservation should be made. So off we went to find a spot for football Sunday and came upon a sign at Delmonico announcing Sunday Football specials in the bar.  The bar was loaded with every liquor bottle imaginable and the menu... We'll it's Emeril Lagasse so enough said. We took a seat and ordered what turned out to be the best meal of our trip! My boyfriend and I ordered up a couple of cold beers, Truffled Parmesan Chips and Lobster Sliders to share. OH EM GEE!!  The Sliders were amazing! Nicely toasted roll filled with a creamy, perfectly seasoned lobster salad. No skimping on the lobster either. Nice, tender chunks and crisp pieces of celery for added crunch. Delish! The chips... We'll, we ordered another batch.. They were THAT good!  Crisp, crunchy, chips drizzled with truffle oil for that earthy yumminess and sprinkled with some tangy grated Parmesan. At halftime, we followed up with the Grilled Ricotta and Tomato Soup. Fantastic! Thick layer of creamy Ricotta and Basil between slices of buttered grilled toast. Not sure if the soup was intended for dipping but that's what we did! The soup was light and tangy -perfect for taking our ricotta sandwich for a dip!!  Meal was amazing & staff was friendly ( Michelle was super attentive). This isn't your Carlos and Charlie's or Senior Frogs so don't let the "football specials" fool you. You get what you pay for and you will definitely pay for what you get here! And it's worth it!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	One of the best steakhouses I have been to.  The petite filet medallions were perfectly cooked with a parmesan crust.  Never was a big fan of this, but it was really well done.  Tender, well seasoned, and cooked exactly right... a perfect combination.  Besides the steak being in the top 3 or 4 all time favorites (Marriott HI Kona and Waikiki tied for #1, chefs are brothers) the sides of scalloped potatoes and mushrooms are fantastic.   The service was exemplary.  Vegas is back!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We were disappointed. Went there for anniversary dinner... There was no Bam, no kicking it up a notch, just kind of taste-free. Although we had three people assigned to the table the service was slow. After dropping the menus it took a while to take our drink order, and then a while longer to get them. but then we got the food before we finished the cocktail. OK. The main complaint is that the food just wasn't that good. Foie gras to start was OK, the wife had the filet and I had buffalo ribeye.  I knew buffalo is iffy, whether you get meat or gristle, but the waiter assured me it was not gamey. Well, this one didn't change my mind--the center was good but I had to do a lot of chewing to get to it. The filet was chewy and really had no taste to it. Creamed spinach had a definite cream taste, but where was the BAM? Same thing with twice baked potatoes--too liquid. To finish we had the espresso creme brulee, which was good, but too cold; with chocolate madelines that were not warm, and again, tasteless.  Just not worth the price we paid at all. I mean I've had better steak at Outback. Sorry Emeril.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I don't usually go to fine dine restaurants while in vegas, but I make a few exceptions and this was one of them. Came here with a few buddies for a birthday. The waiter made our experience a very easy one. He offered many different suggestions and options. After we finally made our decision, the kind gentleman complimented us with bread and such. Afterwards, he poured our glasses with wine and afterwards treated the birthday girl to some lovely dessert. On to the food...\n\nAt first I was on a budget, but then I said to myself, might as well splurge a little so i ordered the filet mignon and I have to admit, it was deeeeelicious. I did not order any sides with it, and wish i had ordered some sort of baked or mash potatoes. \n\noverall, i had a great experience and I would definitely refer someone to this place for great food and great service.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Wow, all I can is wow.  I've been here many times in the past several years, but I have to say, this last time was my most favorite, most memorable and most enjoyable.  \n\nI sat at the bar and met Max Solano; to say he was a bartender is an understatement.  I've never called anyone a "mixologist" before, but if ever there was a man who deserved that title, its Max.  You can tell that his craft goes into every drink.  I sat at the bar, sipping what could have very well been the BEST Old Fashioned I've ever had and I watched him work.  He has the same passion behind the bar as a painter with a canvas, except his paint is liquor and his canvas, a glass.  With his jigger as a brush, he creates a drinkable Jackson Pollock\n\nMy steak was perfectly prepared and my time at the bar was most enjoyable.  It was a perfect finish to a long work week in Vegas.  I can't wait to go back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Food: 4 \nService: 2.5 \n\nDelmonico's was one of the first fancy-schmanchy places I'd eaten at in Vegas. However the last time I ate there was close to five years ago and I've eaten at many other places since then. My husband was eager to try it out again to see if it was as good as he remembered it to be. \nIn summary, I'd say the food was good, the service- not so much. \nWe were lead to our table in the back of the restaurant and even though it was nearly 10:00 pm, the restaurant was really crowded. I was pretty surprised but perhaps this is part of the reason we didn't receive the greatest service. \nFor the appetizer, I had ordered some sort of tomato salad thing from the specials that sounded really interesting. In fact, it was one of the items the server had recommended. However, about 5-10 minutes after ordering, the server came by and informed me they were out of it and asked me if I would like to order something else. The weird thing was, he wasn't apologetic at all, he simply said something along the lines of, "We're out of that, do you want to get another salad?" I'm not going to say he was downright rude but for a restaurant of this caliber, I definitely expected at the very least, some sort of apology. Perhaps even a free appetizer or dessert but perhaps I'm expecting too much? I settled on the salad with goat cheese and I do have to say it was delicious, one of the tastiest salads I can remember having in a long time. However, the journey in getting to that salad was a little bumpy. My husband had a pretty standard garden salad that I tasted and it was pretty good too. \nAnother problem with our ordering is when I tried to order my filet and they asked how I wanted it cooked, I told them my usual method of between medium and medium well, no blood. Okay, I know I am a little difficult but I've never had a problem with a place accommodating my request so at a high end steakhouse, I did not even consider that this would be a difficult task. Well, our server just flat out said he didn't think he could do that. Uhhh, what? Really? It's as if the steak was being cooked in a microwave with only set levels. It was so weird. So I was a little miffed. With that being said, my steak and my husband's steak was cooked properly when it came out. Just a shame that I had to get hazed about it when ordering. All our sides (grits, mushrooms, and spinach) had very generous portions and were pretty good too but perhaps but no real standouts either. \nEven though the steaks were a few dollars pricier than other comparable steakhouse such as Carnevino, I did appreciate that the three steak sauces came free. Other places charge $2-$3 per sauce so it really balanced out and it was nice to try all three. \nI can never resist dessert so I got something I believed was some sort of banana tart. I was surprised when something resembling a big hunk of mud pie with a giant mound of whip cream came out. I took a few bites but it was a bit overwhelming for me. \nAll in all, I would say the food was good but not as good as I remembered it five years ago. Or perhaps I've been spoiled by the different restaurants I've been to since then. My biggest complaint was the service- not only the issues as stated above but just overall, the service felt impersonal and disjointed. I would have to guess that since the restaurant seemed very busy and it was near the end of the night by the time of our reservation, the servers had probably run out of patience. Understandable, we've all had bad days at work but I don't like feeling like the scapegoat. \nI still wouldn't hesitate in recommending Delmonico's to people since my food was good but perhaps I'd recommend a reservation earlier in the day and hope that would alleviate the service issues.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The food was amazing, the atmosphere was calming, and the service was great. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a fine dining experience in the area.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Making a reservation to here is painless via Open Table. Making reservation at other Las Vegas restaurant is so tortuous. \n\nFor appetizers I enjoyed the gumbo over rice and some Artisanal Cheeses.\n\nMy bone in Ribeye was made middle rare to perfection. This was the best steak I ever had in vegas.\n\nFor dessert, my banana cream pie was out of this world. It was light and airy.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	It was a real up and down evening.\nApps - BBQ shrimp were great but there's only 4 of them so don't expect to get filled up.\nEntrees - my wife had the filet medallions and they were basically disgusting. They were terrible cuts of meat and she was only able to eat about half of it. I had the bone in ribeye which was fine but nothing spectacular.\nSides - we had the creamed corn which I thought was terrific, my wife not so much. The potatoes gratin were good but you better like parmesan if you order them. \nDessert - the greatest piece of banana creme pie I've ever had, and it's monsterous!! \nDrinks - They didn't have the bacon and bourbon manhattan but the bartender said we weren't missing anything....so why keep it on the menu? Anyway, to finish off the night I had a Dusk in the Burroughs which is just about the perfect after dinner drink. That and the banana creme pie were easily the best things we had the entire evening. \n\nThe service was top notch and they took the medallions off the bill and also comped the pie, all without my wife saying anything more than she wasn't impressed with the steak. \nIn the end the start was good and finish was fantastic, but with the steaks being so bad it really took away from the whole experience. At roughly $50 a steak we just expect way way better, and with so many fine dining options in Vegas it's tough to see us going back anytime soon. Maybe eventually, but it'll be a while if we do.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	First time here at Delmonico. We came for my b/d birthday as he loves Emeril. Already disappointed by the delay of service. I had to call a server to order bottle of wine and it was explained to us we had to give waitress a number! As we waiting I could observe they tailor more quickly to the larger groups of guests! I hope the food is better than the service. Being an elegant restaurant with hefty prices you would expect a sophisticated bathroom right? Noope down a long hall down to a back room and voila looks like a strip mall bathroom!!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	How does one spell grossly overrated...Delmonico's!!! First, I have seen more originality in a Denny's restaurant in terms of decor. This place is as boring to the eye as watching paint dry...that should have been my clue to exit right!!! There is no color, no cool lighting, no cool art, no great looking floors...nope, a two year old could have designed a more interesting restaurant.\n\nNow let's talk food. It is 3am and I'm on the toilet, let's start there!!! They hand me a steak they claim is prime beef. The only thing prime was the price...52 bucks! The meat was not only tough, but like the decor, it had no taste...NONE. Cosco has better steaks then that thing they brought me. \n\nSo they do take it back a I ordered rack of lamb for, yes, 55 bucks!!! Now those little four rib racks were excellent...but not 55 bucks worth of excellence.  Where's the MEAT! \n\nThen it is time to go to the bathroom...you won't believe it...a dirty, filthy two stall bathroom!!! And the road to the bathroom, and I purposely used the word road, was a journey in itself. How is it that a place that charges 55 bucks for a rack of lamb can have such a piece of s@&t bathroom? \n\nAnd as I sit here on the toilet at 3am all I can tell you is if you think this place is great, then you are from Hoboken NJ because this is a grossly over rated restaurant with horrible food, decor, bathrooms, etc. the owner is laughing to the bank with the fools who go here...AVOID this place. \n\nThe restaurant manage reached out to me...good for them...but I'm not interested.  You get ONE chance to make your reputation, and Mr. Celebrity Chef, you lost it here.  AWFUL PLACE!  GROSSLY OVER PRICED!  DON'T WAIST TIME OR MONEY HERE!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The strip steak was to die for! The banana desert was absolutely genius. Our server (forgot her name) was fantastic! My hubby's rib eye was good! We will be going back!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I have had the best meal of MY LIFE, on 3 separate occasions at Emeril Lagasse's Delmonicos.  I loved how I have never been let down when I have gone there.  I really enjoy steak, and his bone-in ribeye was the best I have EVER had - the crust on the medium-rare perfection was amazing.  \n\nThat being said, I expect a great steak at any steakhouse I go to, so that's not enough to make this my best meal ever.  However, the sides and dessert we equally amazing! The creamed spinach is unlike any other I've ever had, the mushroom were succulent, and the football sized baked potato really hit the spot.  The service was great, the ambiance is perfect, and the chairs and tables are very comfortable.\n\nI wish I could come here more often.  Every time I plan a vegas trip, the sure bet is that I will be here.  I loved it, and I think you would too.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My buddy booked this place for my bachelor party dinner. We had a group of 10 but the restaurant can only seat parties of 9 at most together at one table.  Since we had 10, they had to put us on two separate tables, which was ok, because they were right next to each other anyway.\n\nDecor:  nothing spectacular.  i thought it was alittle too dim for me.  I like a well lit restaurant for the purpose of really getting to see the different colors of your food and wine.  You can tell a lot about your food by it's color...it's freshness, it's doneness, etc.\n\nFood:  Very good.  I had the filet and it was super tender.  My buddies ordered the bone in rib-eye and almost all said it was amongst the best steaks they ever had.  Everything is a la carte so we shared sides of grilled asparagus (good), garlic smashed potatoes (yummy), sauteed wild mushrooms (yummy), and caesar salad (good).\n\nService:  Very good also.  Our waiter was very polite even when our rowdy half drunk group couldn't decide on what to order.  He was very helpful with the wine and picked out a nice bottle of merlot that worked with our budget.  Server's were very fast and attentive.  They made sure everything was perfect...which pretty much was.\n\nPrice:  Pretty fair and expected of a high end steak house.  bone in 20 oz. rib-eye was about $50 and my 12 oz. filet was around $45.  Sides were around $8-12, and one order feeds 2 people.  Yes, they have an extensive wine list and Yes, they have seafood also.\n\nOne last important note:  there isn't a smoking/non-smoking section, so people with kids, and non-smokers beware.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico Steakhouse is the BEST steakhouse I have ever been to. HANDS DOWN. NOTHING else compares. I have been going to this steakhouse for the past 8 years. Pretty much every time I visit Vegas; we find a way to to have dinner there. I have tried the pork chops for dinner. But my "go to" entree is ALWAYS the RIB EYE. It is done to PERFECTION. Always EXPERTLY cooked and seasoned. TENDER and almost MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. The sign of an EXCELLENT STEAKHOUSE - is that your steak is ALWAYS cooked to order and does not need much in the area of extra sauces. Your steak comes with an assortment of Emeril's sauces. I have never needed them and prefer to eat the steak "as is". Service is IMPECCABLE. Your drinks are brought quickly. Your water glass is never empty. Entrees and side dishes are delectable beyond your dreams. Also, the most AMAZING Banana Cream Pie I have ever had the pleasure of eating in my Life. TRUST ME. Spending money at Delmonico Steakhouse is WELL SPENT and I doubt you will be disappointed. It is a true dining EXPERIENCE.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I visited this place with a few of my friends while we were in Vegas for a wedding.  \n\nI can not say it enough.  This is the best steak that I have ever put in my mouth.  This place is well worth every penny.  I ordered the bone in rib eye.  I did not even need a knife to cut the steak.  The steak was melt in your mouth delicious.  The bacon wilted spinach salad is bomb!  I have never enjoyed a salad or steak this good.  I make it a point to stop by this place when I am in Vegas.  \n\nWent back in September and the restaurant has lost it.  Ordered the bone in ribeye and it tasted like death. The maître d, said the meat was over aged.  Why the hell would you serve it if the quality was not up to standards.  After issues with food we were treated like crap.  Not impressed. There are tons of good restaurants in Vegas. Don't waste you time or hard earned money!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Came here twice in a single week so I had to augment and order different items.\n\nI started the week off with the bone in new york, it was a tad bit too salty for my taste.  Nothing to really say about it.\n\nMidweek I had to go for some seafood, sure it's a steakhouse, but the bbq salmon it was.  Nothing too special, overall I'm not too fond of Delmonico.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	BY FAR my favorite steakhouse in the country.  The steak is seasoned perfectly, no sauce required.  All sides we ordered were great and I think we ordered every side on the menu, you must get truffle and parmesan chips!  The service is incredible, a completely orchestrated dinner service is always impressive when your at a table of 9 and each plate hits the table at the same time.  Servers/staff are watching every movement and are very good at anticipating needs and requests.  The dining room has a modern minimalist look but very nice, you dont hear this much but the tables and chairs were really nice.  When in Vegas make sure you go to Delmonico.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	very disappointed. my steak was burnt and it wasn't great.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Ditto on the disappointment.\n\nI would have given D's maybe one more star, but since I paid $120  (well, factoring ~$10 to help pay for our guest of honor).for my dinner, that just really knocked down the rating.  D's ain't worth it.\n\nI was there with a bachelor party, twelve dudes, and the average price was $120+ for each person.\n\nMy food: bone in rib eye, medium rare, shared a side of creamed spinach, and no drink.\n\nYes, all this for $120.\n\nRib eye: cooked perfectly, huge slab of meat.  I expected a nice marble, maybe a little excess fat, but by the time I was done, maybe a quarter of the original steak was off to the side...all fat and gristle.  I'm also spoiled and used to the 300 degree plate that you get at good ol' Mastro's, and since D's steak is served on a regular plate, the huge steak seemed to get cold pretty damn fast.\n\nCreamed spinach:  I could have gotten something better out of a can.  Got stone cold real fast too.\n\nAll this for $120.  \n\nService: Very good and very attentive.\n\nGuess this is where my $120 went.\n\n...\n\n$120 \n\n:(
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Fancy! =)\n\nWell, I must admit that my husband does know how to pick them. We went here for dinner during our weekend getaway and I was not disappointed. The style and ambiance is very simple and chic. If I may add another word - classy.\nThe service was impeccable! The waiters (we had 3), were so welcoming and genuinely interested in how they could make our stay there memorable. So that's always a big plus for me (i do not like snooty waiters). \nThe food was great! Not the best I've tasted but still up there =). I had the white fish with lump crab and it was delicious! The fish was soft and not chewy at all and the crab definitely complimented the slight saltiness of the fish. Great find!\nThe New orleans bbq shrimp were a tad too salty for my taste, but nevertheless, delicious.\nI would've definitely ordered dessert, but I was so full that I just couldn't get myself to do it. \nIn any case, I had a wonderful time and I must implore you to try it if you are ever at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas (did that sound classy??? eh i tried). Lol.\nBottom line: go for it!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I really liked Delmonico.  It's a bit pricey, but not unusual given the quality and location in the Venetian.  I especially loved the lobster bisque - definitely try it.  The Ahi Tuna Tartar was pretty good, but not a must get.  My friend and I shared the Chateaubriand filet, which was perfectly done and delicious.  Highly recommended!  \n\nAnd, as icing on the cake, they have an incredible scotch list.  \n\nThey are able to accommodate large groups, which is nice - but even with a reservation, our wait was an hour, which is unacceptable - minus one star.\n\nI've grown to like Vegas more and more as I've learned that they have something for everyone - great food, shows, clubs, gambling, outdoor activities, pools, shopping, etc.  Delmonico is a great addition to the already outstanding food selection in Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Steakhouses in Vegas are like Starbucks in the USA... they're everywhere. If you're passing by a nice restaurant in a hotel casino, there's a good chance that it's a steakhouse. Maybe Vegas has figured out that eating an expensive steak will make you feel better despite the fact that you just lost hundreds of dollars...\n\nSome friends and I had lunch at Delmonico's this past weekend and we got there right when it opened for lunch. We were their first customers and spent most of our lunch being the only people in the restaurant. Therefore, I guess it's no surprise why we got such great service. We made small talk with our servers and they were very pleasant and attentive throughout our entire meal.\n\nOne friend who has been here before was raving about their lobster bisque and banana creme pie. I got to try their lobster bisque ($16) and thought it was good but I'm no connoisseur of bisque.  The bisque comes with scrumptious pieces of lobster and it was very rich and creamy. I ordered the Filet of Beef Medallions ($21) and they were super tender. Although they were covered in bread crumbs and a mushroom type sauce, the medallions were quite delicious. The entree isn't very big and I was still hungry afterwards so I suggest getting this alongside an appetizer. I got a bite of the Banana Creme Pie and not only did it look amazing, the taste of it was delightful. \n\nDelmonico's is a surprisingly huge restaurant. I hope their dinner draws in a larger crowd that it does for lunch or else much of their space could be put to better use. The lunch menu is rather limited but it's priced right with the most expensive entree being only $21. All in all, pretty good food and extremely good service. You gotta try that Banana Creme Pie!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is by far the best meal I have eaten so far! We sat in a private room in the back and was able to tour the kitchen after our meal. The service was superb ! The food had so much flavor and everything was cooked to perfection . When you sit in the back the chef picks what you eat and that is the way to go.  I tried the foie gras, it tasted like a dessert and was so good. We started with halibut with risotto , lamb, ribeye and the best dessert ever. Pecan pie and banana foster pie.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great experience. I enjoyed the filet and caesar salad! My steak was cooked to PERFECTION! The service was top notch! I will definitely return! One of my favorite steak houses in Las Vegas!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	On our stay at the Venetian, we decided to try this steak house one night.\nI had the ribeye and my wife went for the filet mignon. Both steaks were absolutely delicious and cooked to perfection. The server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu .\nFor the desert we opted to share the bread pudding,and I have to say it is one of the best I have ever eaten.\nVery good experience overall!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My friend and I ordered a bone in ribeye. More than half of it was fat. Not acceptable! The only two things that were really good was the twice baked potato and the banana cream pie. \n\nThe food is very expensive and not worth it. The ambiance is also lacking for the prices they charge. I will not be coming back to this establishment. You're better off going to Ruth's Chris for the same money spent.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Service was thorough and precise, not the friendliest but there were no errors. \n\nDecor, well, ummmm there is none. Lights on a wire cable is the extent of that. Don't expect more, I'm not joking. Not a painting, wall paper, photo, drawing or stitch of color. Anywhere. Plain, off white walls.\n\nThe bread was lovely (I always taste the bread) I ate it all, without shame.\n\nSpecialty cocktails were all great, we tried 3, all of which I forgot the names of but the gin with Midori was my fave, I may have had 2 possibly 3 lol\n\nFood was above average but not mind blowing\n\nKing crab app was okay, didn't taste fresh to me\n\nTable side Cesar salad was good, I liked the dressing and loved the anchovies but the presentation was done behind me so I didn't get to enjoy the show. Note to self-when you return don't sit in a booth. \n\nBone in ribeye was yummy. We shared, but it wasn't the medium my husband ordered but I wasnt devastated because I prefer medium rare although it was closer to rare. Mushrooms were good, nothing special.\n\nCaramel cake was delish, very sweet but that's the point! \n\nWe will be back, it will be awhile since date nights are rare due to a 2.5 year old child beast but we will be back. I look forward to the filet.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	my bruddahs had our "boy's" bachelor party dinner over there couple years ago. (peeps from california)\n1. great service.\n2.waited on us constantly.\n3. great steaks & sides.\n4. expensive cost = excellent customer satisfaction.\n5. should be best of las vegas.\n6. must dress nice for this location.\n7. bar immediately close by as a waiting area, with giant lcd t.v. screens for sports.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Amazing does not explain how great this dinner was!  My wife and I were there to celebrate our anniversary, which eating at a fine dining steakhouse is becoming the annual tradition.  \n\nI had made a reservation, and when we arrived, we were greeted numerous times from several different people offering congratulations on our anniversary.  This made everything seem special for my wife, who had no idea we were coming here.  Then we were taken to our table.\n\nWe were given a near endless wine list (book!) and expected to decide from there?  No, the sommelier came over and determined our wine for us, and did not pick the most expensive bottle, but one of the best ones we have had, for way less than the next closest we had drank a while back.\n\nThe menu is not too over the top, but just right.  I wanted to have the escargot, but my wife cannot bring herself to eat this, so we had the BBQ shrimp.  Being from Texas, we love barbeque, but this was different, and superb.  Four huge shrimp covered in a sauce that I have never had the likes of before.  Our main entrée was the Chateaubriand cooked tableside.  I enjoy my steak rare to med-rare, but my wife does not like to see blood in her steak. (I know, I'm working on this)  They were able to cook the same piece of meat to my liking as well as hers and it came out perfect.  Not a thing was left on either of our plates. \n\nWe concluded the meal with two desserts, I had Emeril's banana cream pie.  An incredible end to a wonderful meal.  My wife had the crème bruele,  and explained it in details I have never heard her use to explain food.  On top of this, we were given a small sample of sorbet with a happy anniversary not written in chocolate on the plate.\n\nThere were so many waiters and helpers taking care of our every need that it was almost impossible to say who was the actual waiter, although the main waiter was superb.  He took over for the cook at our table because he knew exactly how we wanted the steak, and never did he let anything sit out of place, no drink ran low, and not one thing was missed.\n\nAgain, amazing can not explain how great this meal was.  We will definitely stop again next time we are in Vegas!\n\nI knew how much it would be before we went, but for the sake of a review, I will say our meal for two was right at $300, but well worth it.  If you are looking for a fine dining restaurant and not wanting to spend this much, then you aren't really looking for fine dining.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico is a favorite. Time after time it delivers stellar food and superb service.\n\nThe Caesar salad for two is a must, as is the bone in ribeye. We've also enjoyed daily specials that have served up surf and turf, and some of the tastiest lamb chops we've ever tasted. We've sampled a bunch of other dishes, as well. The only disappointment has been at dessert and that was banana cream pie. It was served partially frozen. Ever since we tend to skip dessert and treat ourselves to Jamaican Blue Mountain French pressed coffee, instead. It is wonderful.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Excellent steaks.  The best we had on the whole trip.  The wine was also terrific.  The waitress was also very friendly and accommodating.  The only negatives were the side dishes.  The asparagus was just OK and seemed flavorless.  The potatoes were also lacking in flavor.  The steaks are well worth it though and I would go back in a heartbeat.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had a great dinner here with some close friends. I had the filet, ahi tartare, and sauteed spinach. Everything was very good and the steak was done just right. The only things that I thought were subpar were the bread rolls and the decor. \n\nI really enjoyed Delmonico.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	You know you're growing up when you spend a weekend in Vegas and don't hit the clubs but fancy restaurants. It's a bittersweet feeling. CUT has been my absolute favorite place for steak and fine dining for the past five years but we decided to try somewhere new for once.\n\nFood (4): The food was great but I wasn't blown away. I didn't leave the restaurant replaying every bite. We ordered the heirloom tomato soup (with grilled cheese sandwich), mac and cheese, crab legs, and two steaks. I got the special steak of the day that came with shaved pieces of truffle on top. Don't get me wrong. Everything was delicious and I had no problem with my food, but it just wasn't memorable. \n\nAmbiance (3.5): It's a fancy restaurant but felt like any other bougie restaurant inside of a Vegas hotel. We were seated at a corner table but there definitely could have been some more space between us and the pair next to us.\n\nService (4): Service was also a positive experience. Our waiter was pleasant and friendly and made small talk with us. And when my date found a long curly hair mixed into his crab legs, the waiter apologized and took it back without a second thought. When he came back with a new plate the legs looked like they came from the fattest crabs possible.\n\nSo overall, a wonderful experience and I would have no qualms about returning. But CUT remains my favorite steak restaurant.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We had planned this Valentine's Dinner/birthday dinner for over a week and were really looking forward to it. Service was superb, venue/ambiance was lovely. We ordered a sea scallop, mushroom and black truffle sauce appetizer- it was tasty. We both had the lobster bisque, nothing special, but very good, and presentation was nice. My husband ordered the double-cut pork chop, the size of a dinosaur. It was supposed to be medium, but was charred and a bit over done. I ordered the sea bass, but asked the chef to prepare it like the snapper special. It was thin, overly salted, and overall just not good. I am not a fan of al dente rice. I'm sure the chef prepares entrees a certain way for a reason, this just missed the mark in so many ways for me, when I had such high expectations. The head server promptly replaced my meal with a medium rare filet, in about 60 seconds. The steak looked dry, besides the pat of butter atop, the plate was hot, making me think it had been under the food warmer for some time. There was a crusted char on the exterior and Cajun seasoning, which again in my opinion was too much, and too salty. I want to taste the steak at a steakhouse, not cover it. Of all of the options in Vegas, we could get a lot better tasting food with equivalent price and service elsewhere. We will not be returning.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico is\nEmeril's Vegas steakhouse\nSuch yummy goodness
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	From the get go, Delmonico was wonderful. We were introduced to a couple people taking care of us that evening. They made sure we were completely taken care of throughout the whole experience.  We chose a bottle of a wine for the meal and it paired perfectly. The wine list was the most extensive list I had seen in a long time. It was all broken down by style of wine and where the grapes originated from. Then we chose the house salad to pair with a half dozen oysters. The oysters were absolutely wonderful and the dressing for the house salad was great as well. I ordered crab crusted medallions and my boyfriend ordered the filet. Both came out perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. We were too stuffed to take on the desert menu but the overall experience at Delmonico was delicious. I would recommend to anyone and everyone.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Not worth the money.\n\nThis place makes me wonder how Emeril is considered a great chef.\n\nFrom the salad to the steak, I remember everything here being too salty. "Let's kick it up a notch" my a$$. It seemed more like let's cover up the fact that I can't cook with tons of salt.\n\nBy the time I left the restaurant, I felt like my blood pressure must be sky high with all the salt I ingested. \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be going back here again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Just ate at Delmonico's for dinner tonight. I was really in the mood for a good steak, and this place did not disappoint AT ALL!! The pappardelle mushroom pasta appetizer was not quite as flavorful a dish as I anticipated, but very good none the less. Also had the truffle and Parmesan potato chips, which are a MUST HAVE!!  The Bone in New York Strip was quite possibly the most flavorful steak I have had in a long time if not ever. The Service was spot on and the atmosphere was relaxed. My wife and I visit Vegas once a year and we will be sure to make it to Delmonico's at least once per trip from now on.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	"Everything taste good except for the steak and foie gas~ seriously, not even outback quality. Lobster bisque and pecan pie saved the day.. Don't come if u want decent steak. Like Gordon's steakhouse, this place is overrated~~~" I am giving 3 starts just because of the amazing lobster bisque  and the surprisingly good pecan pie. Also, the service is too good to deserve a two star. Me and my friend paid 80d/person to eat here and we didn't get the expected experience. I know we all expected vegas to be overpriced but I would rather pay for some other restaurant that would worth it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I am not absolutely dying to go back, but I grew up in Las Vegas and can say that this one of the finer fine dining establishments. My mom, her boyfriend, my sister, and I ate here for a special occasion post-Phantom and there wasn't a single mentionable flaw in the experience. Everything was fresh, perfectly cooked to order, and tasted great. The service was attentive (though perhaps the tiniest bit slow toward the end of our meal) and friendly. \n\nThe ambiance was nice, excluding the "old ladies' night out" table nearby making a lot of drunken noise (they were just enjoying themselves but boy did one of them have a memorable cackle!) and would be suitable for a nice date.\n\nI recommend the caesar composed tableside as well as the tomato salads to begin with. I enjoyed my seared tuna and the steak and scallops I tasted were excellent, as was the tiramisu for dessert .
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The best steak and the best service.  I just wish there was a Delmonico around where I live.  My boyfriend and I travel to Las Vegas just for Delmonico.  We absolutely love it!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I had the summer special petite ribeye, gumbo, smashed potatoes and vanilla ice cream for dessert. I also had a side of BBQ shrimp. Everything was amazing! This is definitely the best steak I've ever had. The BBQ shrimp are expertly prepared. I'd definitely recommend anyone eating here. I had eaten here back in 2002 and it was the best meal I had ever had, I was excited to return and see if it still was as great. It definitely was!  The service was the best we had all weekend. Such a great place to dine.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went here with some friends while my husband and I were having our couple's shower in Vegas prior to our wedding. His best man raved about the restaurant, so we decided to give it a go.\n\nWe made a reservation for the first seating, but they weren't quite ready for us when we got there, so we sat in the bar area and ordered a couple of drinks. I got a very good pino noir, though I can't recall where it was from.\n\nWhen it was time to be seated, we were escorted to our table through a line of wait staff. Honestly, it was a bit uncomfortable walking through all those people. Once we got to our table, our server came over and gave us menus. Both the server and her assistant were pleasant enough, though I don't know I would go as far as saying there were "friendly."\n\nWe all ordered our starters and make courses, plus a couple of sides. I got the lobster bisque, which I wasn't all that impressed with. I had better lobster bisque on cruise ship. It was a bit salty and the way they presented it was a bit tacky, in my opinion.\n\nWhen the entrees came, everything was fine. The steak was good, but I don't know that I would ever pay $50+ for it again. I asked for medium, and I got medium rare. Which was fine for me, but one of my friends had the same problem, and it kinda grossed her out. So she had to send it back. The server got the problem fixed very quickly, and it was perfect the second time around.\n\nI did like that they came with some sauces. The Bearnaise was very good and my husband devoured the peppercorn sauces. The sides were all good, but not as big as we had anticipated. Our waiter said they should feed 3-4 people. However, when you have two 250+ pound guys with you, it was not enough.\n\nThe desserts were FANTASTIC. I had the creme brule, which was perfect. Soft and creamy, with a yummy hard shell on the top. I would order that again in a heart beat. And we all felt the deserts were very reasonably priced for what we received. Definitely big enough for 2 people to share.\n\nOverall, 3 starts. Everything was good and probably would have gotten 4 stars, if not for the price of everything. When you pay that much for food, you expect to be wowed. And we just weren't. But no major complaints either.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I thought it was good, but not $300 good for a couple.  Service was good, my steak was good, and the little grilled cheese were good, but I honestly expected to be blown away.  It is Emeril after all!!!  I would have been just as content spending a hundred bucks less at any number of other great restaurants in Vegas
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A first class steak house and pricey. Everything is a la carte. I ordered a glass of wine, the wedge salad, filet mignon and a twice baked potato and it was a little over $100. The filet was excellent. A couple  at my table ordered the Cesar salad for two and it was prepared table side, it looked so good! The only reason for not giving the restaurant a five star rating was the noise level. We arrived about 9:30 pm and it was a Friday night and there were many bachelor party tables. Having a casual conversation was difficult.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Its a fancy steakhouse in Vegas.  Sure it was great, the food was good the service was superb and the wine selection was almost too much to deal with, but its expensive.  hey its a fancy steakhouse in Vegas.  So it lives up to its name.  If you are looking for a great night out for steak this is as good a selection as any.  Just be prepared to pay about $100-$150/person if you are going to be on wine.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Came here with friends for our high end streak meal during a recent week in Vegas. It did not disappoint. For drinks, I ordered a High West rye Manhattan and it arrived perfectly mixed; maybe the smoothest Manhattan I've ever imbibed. Ceaser salad very good, but no anchovies. Two of us split chateaubriand and it was perfect, although presentation was somewhat boring. The potatos and asparagus were good but not spectacular. Another friend got the fillet and it was so tender she started cutting it with get butter knife and didn't even notice! The wine list is overwhelming. 93 pages. It's better to know what you want and see  if it's there than to try and choose. The decor is somewhat vanilla, but nice.  Also, the place is huge - much larger inside than what you see when you walk in off Restaurant Row in The Palazzo.  The crowd made for pretty fun people watching; there seemd to be a lot of middle aged men with their much younger "dates."  Maybe it was "take your niece to dinner" night.  But overall, a very nice, entertaining  evening out, but spendy.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We came here on a mission called "20-ounce Bone-In Ribeye". That is all we wanted.\n\nSo, we ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes. We shared both over a few glasses of red wine. The steak is served with a glaze of butter worcestershire, bearnaise and chimichutri sauces. It was huge, beautifully cooked, and tasted good. It was missing one thing for me: SALT! My impression was that it had none. My BF said he liked it as it was. Don't get me wrong, it was a really good steak but it left me wanting more from the flavor spectrum. The potatoes were okay.\n\nService is always impeccable at Emeril's restaurants.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had the chateau Breon and pride mountain Cabernet for dinner....wow! That was absolutely delicious food.  The tables were a little cramped and loud but still worth the trip. Pricey but still worth it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Having eaten here now a handful of times, I felt it was time to finally leave a review (not that they need it, based on their stars.) That having been said, it's really hard to go wrong with a steak here! The NY strip is huge, delicious, and, in my experience, cooked to perfection. The sides, while pretty standard fare, are quite good. I find the creamed spinach and mushrooms to be particularly noteworthy, while the asparagus was uninspired. The value is reasonable, in spite of the fairly high price, so no complaints there. With the number of great options in the Venetian/Palazzo, let alone in Las Vegas in its entirety, it can be hard to stand out, but Delmonico Steakhouse manages to do so.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Well?  I stay at the Palazzo or Venetian a few times a year, and try to eat at DelMonico once a year.\n\nRecently went with a few coworkers, and a good friend of mine-  My liver.  We both waddled out feeling the need for a good workout...  But that would be for the next afternoon of course.\n\nFor starters, a Caesar.  Got to lay a good foundation.\n\nNext, why would the thick cut bacon NOT be chosen for an appetizer?  We each ate an order.  Ha.  Excellent.  Full already?\n\nOk.  A buddy of mine shared his bone-in Ribeye, medium rare, and it was done perfectly.  Firm, but marbled and juicy.\n\nI ate the lobster tail which must have weighed a pound.  The breadcrumbs were a nice touch, and I drizzled each bite with some butter.  Heavenly.\n\nYes, I'll be back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I'll start this review off for you skimmers out there that don't read long reviews. The bone-in rib-eye is the greatest steak experience you will ever have, hands down. Just eat it. Go. Do it.\n\nNow for you that are still with me, here's my full-on, cash money, baller review...for what it's worth:\n\nDelmonico must have a good database manager behind the scenes, because it had been a long time since my last dinner there (prob 5-6 years), yet they immediately greeted me and remembered my patronage (2 visits prior).  What a great feeling (and rather impressive to my gf) that the host and hostess and wait-staff greet you like you're a goddamn king touring the countryside. \n\nThis trip to Las Vegas was during a getaway weekend and to see long time friends, but we had a little dinner the night before some festivities for just us. I wanted to visit Delmonico again, because I had remembered such a positive experience with food and service the times before.\n\nSo we are greeted by the sommelier and our lead waiter, who throw out a few drinks and possible pairings, review the specials, roll over some changes in the menu (all from memory mind you). We knew we were eating steaks and heartier dishes, so we opted for a bottle of a good Sonoma Cab Sauv we recognized.  \n\nThe chef paid his compliments with an amuse bouche' of a olive oiled crustini with duck fat and a mushroom.  It was a delicious little oily, fatty, salty bite that told the taste buds "hey bitches...I'm comin' for you...get ready!"\n\nWe were treated to some hot brioche popovers and full-fat butter, and I had to oblige at least one...cannot say no...(it's completely un-American to pass up on such things).\n\nWe decided to start the evening by sharing an heirloom tomato and burrata cheese salad (faux caprese), and a table-side Lobster bisque. The salad was graciously split onto two plates for us, and was perfectly portioned with greens, veg, cheese, and a light dressing (that was not overpowering). The bisque was poured at our table with huge chunks of lobster, and a smooth velvet-like texture. Flavors were perfect and the temp was outstanding. I had mine and finished my gf's (she always worries about getting to full before the main meal comes).\n\nI had ordered the bone-in rib-eye au poivre and my lady chose the Filet Medallions. I must impress upon you again that the Bone-in Rib-eye IS the way to go. It is perfectly broiled at high temp, with amazing peppercorn seasoning and having it with the mushrooms sauce and onions is the bomb-sauce. There is nothing like it. It is a HUGE cut of meat, with great crusting outside, perfect marbling, and the bone-in flavor. The hot-reddish/pink medium to medium-rare center makes for a tender, juicy, and magnificent steak.  I honestly didn't even partake of her medallions much, because I didn't need to, and wouldn't cheat on my rib-eye.  I let the lady try some of mine and she immediately agreed its the best steak, anywhere, ever. We had a side of asparagus as well, which I felt very bad for because I gave it very little love. I hate leaving soldiers on the battlefield but I wanted to win the war with that steak and had a long night ahead of me of shows and clubs and didn't want terrible meat sweats...so I had to be courteous of tummy room.\n\nNow that we've effectively covered food, let me give a swag at the service. Top notch. All the way around. Polite, informed, friendly, attentive enough without being intrusive. Well-trained veteran folks throughout...no schmucks looking to hump tables as a side gig, these are true to form, real career servers who take pride in their appearance, their posture, plating, timing, knowledge, and truly love their career...these folks work years before graduating to a place like Delmonico or Craftsteak, etc. These guys get huge tips and get to work with fine chefs in multi-million dollar restaurants...they're the cream of the wait staff crop.\n\nTotal wine, apps, dinner (no dessert, saved room for later on) was what I expected at ~$300. Well worth it to treat ourselves and enjoy a top-notch meal.  \n\nLook folks, even if you're not an Emeril fan (yes he owns the Delmonico name), you can still love this place. A) he's no longer the executive chef of either location, B) the experience is always good here and the place stands alone on its merits, and C) that damned rib-eye is scheduled for my last meal on planet Earth (someday). \n\nTrust me folks...when in Vegas...eat like a damned king. Treat yourself to amazing service, amazing food, and good times...ENJOY!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Located at the Venetian Hotel and a Emeril Lagasse establishment. I made reservations for four persons BC our vendor wanted to treat us to dinner.\n\nWe started off with drinks at the beautiful bar and made our way to the plush dinning area. I started off with the gumbo which was superb. For dinner what better choice then the dry aged in house ribeye?  For sides we enjoyed garlic mushrooms, asparagus, NOLA creamed spinach and for dessert I savored the a entire Emeril's banana cream pie slice (it was huge and delish). My co worker from Phoenix enjoyed the bone in filet and he ended his meal with  key lime pie which he also raved about. \n\nThis was definitely a meal that was memorable and thank you to the entire staff at Delmonico Steakhouse. It's great knowing I can get a solid NOLA influenced meal with having to go to NOLA!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	One of best steaks I've had. Definitely a solid 4.5 even better, I dined on lobster bisque, a bone in ribeye  steak w/ smashed potatoes, sauted mushrooms and creamed spinach. \n\nMy steak was was cooked to perfection, juicy throughout. not to mention the little things such as the pat of compound butter that added that punch. The lobster bisque was smooth and rich. The sides we're all great as well. \n\nThe pricing was fair, it is a la carte steakhouse after all thats what you come to expect at an establishment like this. Service was just right, very attentive but at the same time the wait staff wasnt breathing down our neck. Loved my experience here, hopefully we will back again soon!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Bread pudding and bone in rib eye and wine makes it 5 stars but the sides are so so ... Good not exceptional more to come...Finished dinner- still reminiscing about the bread pudding....its creamy, not to sweet, enough raisins, and ice on top- w/ pecan candied crunch- perfection.  the bone in rib eye is good- not the best I have ever had.  The reason being the ration of fat to meat was a little high- i do like marbled fat in the steak but when 1/3 of the steak is fat...i couldn't eat it w/o thinking of clogging my arteries.  Wine was exception- the Italy-"Vertigo" was yummy.  The best experience for me was spending it w/ my girl-riends esp for her 30th B-day! the service makes you feel grown up and independent!.  Enjoy!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	YOUR MILEAGE MAY VARY.\n\nlately this place seems to go in either extreme- feast or famine. sometimes, the food is absolutely incredible and everything is jusssssst right. othertimes, it just falls flat on its face. in all fairness, it's a really large restaurant and i suppose it's inevitable for some things to get lost in the cracks here and there. still, the first 3-4 times i ate here, everything was flawless... so i know what it could be.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Quite delicious! I wouldn't say that this Steakhouse is creative or unique, but what I will say is that it's classic, delicious and savory. The decor is comfortable, quietly & minimally luxurious and the service was very good without being intruding. I was dining with my family (sister, mom, father and my husband Russ). \n\nFor an appetizer, I ordered the Lobster Bisque which was very good but not super memorable and for the entree, I ordered the Surf and Turf. Perfection. I found everything to be just as I ordered it and savored every last piece of my meal. We got the Bacon-Cheddar Polenta which was remarkably good and the mashed potatoes (which I didn't try) and also, the creamed spinach. It may not be revolutionary, but Delmonico's does good food just right :D\n\nI wouldn't say that I really "stepped out of my box" with what I ordered, but I will say that they have a wonderful wine list, a nice group of people working for them, and tasty food. This is the perfect place to dine with a small group or family where everyone can get something they like. It's more of a safe bet while dining in Vegas - but a good one. It's also located in the Venetian - which is as they say - a "feast for the eyes" I like!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I liked this place a lot and would probably go here again next time I'm in Vegas.  They have a nice bar/lounge to hang out in if you have to wait for a table.  Very good food and very professional staff.  The presentation when you order an expensive bottle of wine is pretty amazing.  Not quite 5 stars though.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I gave this five stars because I feel it is the best steakhouse in Las Vegas. I have been to CUT, SW, Craft, and Del Frisco's, but Delmonico's takes the cake. We went in a large (all male) group so I wont describe each dish, but simply give a brief overview. The service and decor are both wonderful. You were given a relatively large amount of space, at least for a steakhouse. The appetizers, steaks, sides, and desserts are great! A must go to for those looking for an upscale, but great steak dinner. In terms of price, it is average for a Vegas steakhouse.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is by far the best steakhouse that I have been too. Maybe I say this due to the lack of high end steakhouses I have been too. But everything to me here blew my mind. \n\nOne thing I want to mention is the level of service. I have never had such great service at any other restaurant than here. The food was served exactly at the same time by 4 servers, and they would refold your napkin if you were to step away from the table. I felt like I was treated like royalty. \n\nMy steak came out perfect. And all the sides, especially the creamed spinach and mushrooms, were great as well.\n\nI would love to come back to this place again. The steaks are amazing and the service is top notch!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	bone in rib eye is amazing.... everything else is pedestrian..
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I got the 3 course special, it was amazing. The Tomato soap was the best I've ever had, then I got the tenderloin medallions so good, followed by the pecan pie also very good. The wait staff was great too with good recommendations. I would recommend this place to anyone.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I went here with a few friends of mine and was BLOWN away. And to think, I almost didn't even go. I was feeling cheap and didn't want to spend a grip on dinner, but boy am I glad that I went and had the wonderful opportunity to eat at this fabulous restaurant with some dear friends of mine. \n\nFirst off, the ambiance is very simple, understated, and clean. Nothing overly done. In fact, I heard it was on purpose so that you can focus on the food and the people rather than the art and ambiance of the place.\n\nSecondly, service is top-notch. If you're paying the big bucks, it's no wonder. They totally spoil you here and answer all your silly questions!\n\nThirdly, ANYTHING you order off the menu will be delicious! We each ordered different items and tried each others plates and were blown away. You can't go wrong with anything you order!\n\nEverything was perfectly made and cooked very well and tender. So juicy! So flavorful and so plentiful!\n\nYou definitely get what you pay for at this restaurant. I would totally go back either with a significant other or a nice group of close friends. It was such a lovely experience!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Now this is the way good food is suppose to make you feel!!  Excellent! My filet was superb, melt in your mouth good and cooked to perfection. Wife ordered the Red snapper which was amazing. No fishy linger at all, just delicious! Overall this place is great and service is top notch! This steakhouse is a must
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Our bad experience started with the lady who answered when I called to set a resv. She sounded like she wasn't very happy and didn't make me feel good about planning to go to Delmonicos.  \nWe get there and the hostess simply said "follow me" she did not make eye contact or even ask "how's your evening?" She walked so fast to our table it was hard to keep up.  She sat us, gave us a napkin, said nothing at all, and walked away.  (Also they only have white napkins.. I'm used to fine dining where your napkin, either white or black, be offered to go with your ensemble.)\nNext, our server(s), didn't seem to care that we were dining there.  Not sure if they judged based on skin color, age, and style of clothes, but it felt like they did.  After offering us drinks and giving us menus, it was about an 8 to 10 minute wait to see our server again.. Mind you that we'd chosen what we'd have for dinner and had our menus closed a majority of that time.\nOverall for service from beginning til end was way below par for such a place.  We did not feel welcomed nor that they gave 2 funks about us.\nFOOD:\nMy bone in rib eye was ordered medium and came out medium well, which made it particularly dry and tough.  My spouses bone in rib eye was cooked correctly (medium), but was nothing to call home about.\nI ordered my steak Oscar style.  The asparagus was the highlight of our dinner and the crab seemed a but overlooked and dry.\nWe also had a lobster tail each, which came de-shelled and on top of the rib eye.  Drawn butter was brought out but lemon was not, nor offered.\nWe had the New Orleans style creamed spinach.. The only "new Orleans" about it was the name.  The spinach tasted fresh but it was about a 3.5/5 on overall taste and quality.\nFor the price there are many better options in Las Vegas (Mastro's ocean club; the capital grille, del frisco's..).  \nWe will surely never return.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Oh.  My.  Lord.  Best steak I've ever had, super tender and tasty even though relatively unadorned.  I thought Mesa Grill was good (and it is) but this hunk of cow takes the cake.  The ambiance is nice although the decor is a bit spartan, the wine list is far more than my gin-drinking brain could ever comprehend, and to top it all off the service was on another level:  There were like three dudes running around bringing us stuff and clearing plates all night.  And you wanna know about attention to detail?  The one thing Vegas has heretofore *never* gotten right was the after-dinner espresso.  Never hot enough, or no head of crema, or just awful tasting.  But Delmonico's brew was not only good tasting, but they actually warmed up the cup!  (The coffee snobs among you will know what I'm on about here.)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico Steakhouse is at the Venetian.\n\nAfter the Venetian lost my luggage last summer (see my Venetian reviews for the entire story) I swore I wouldn't step foot in the Venetian. It pains me to admit this, but I stepped foot in the Venetian during my most recent Vegas trip :(  Just to clarify, this was NOT by choice, but by circumstance. Me, my boyfriend, and 2 other couples wanted to do a nice dinner. Long story short, one of the other couples raved about this restaurant and made dinner reservations for all of us. \n\nWith that being said, this steakhouse blew me away. It was surprisingly really good.  \n\n**APPETIZERS: I had the French Onion Soup and my boyfriend had a salad. The appetizers were so-so. We definitely could've have done without ordering them since our entrees and sides were filling.\n\n**ENTREES: My boyfriend and I each ordered the Bone in Ribeye. Had we known how HUGE they were, we would've just ordered one and shared. I was surprised at how good my steak was. I wanted to pull a "Fred Flinstone" and pick up the steak with my hands and gnaw on the entire thing.  My steak was prepared well, seasoned well, and tasted delicious. Even with all that deliciousness there was just so much meat that neither of us finished our steaks. \n\n**SIDES: We had the Creamed Corn Gratin & Potato Gratin. Both of which were creamy and delicious.  \n\nThe service was fine, the ambiance was nice, the steak and sides were fantastic. I'm just annoyed that this restaurant is located in the Venetian -_-
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Excellent service and food.  Not inexpensive, but worth the price.  Tender steaks.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Always wanted to try it..... too bad it sucked! Lobster bisque was bland, no seasoning... gumbo was so undercooked the shrimp jumped in my water glass! Absolutely no seasoning, bartender warned me that people complain about it having no spice... that was an understatement... now lets talk about the Lobster rolls... brioche buns are great, but when you pretoast them and leave them under a heat lamp it tends to ruin it. The mixture itself was bland.. again.. seems to be in the normal scheme of things.. anyway, after a monumental disappointing lunch, I'm gonna head to the room for a nap. 3 am came way too early!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	i had the bbq salmon and it was wow perfect, yummmmm...the service was excellent also, side of their garlic mashed potatoes were fantastic also, definitely be going back
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We were very disappointed with Delmonicos steakhouse. I ordered my steak medium to medium rare and it was overcooked and burnt on the outside.  My fiancé's steak was also sub par. Our sides came out cold.  Dessert was just ok. The worst part was the bathroom- it was filthy and I was disgusted (garbage had overflowed all over the floor).  Definitely not worth the $300+ we paid.  We will not return.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	i ate here on 10-27-14 around 5:30 pm.  i enjoyed my dining experience in the bar.  the hostess staff was very friendly.  the bar staff did a great job too.  they took the time to go over the menu and to have some small talk.  made the dining experience more enjoyable.\n\nfor dinner i ordered the bone in ribeye.  i really enjoyed this steak more than "the cut" which was in the palazzo.  my delmonico ribeye had more flavor and juices!  i enjoyed my free bread basket too.  the side of smashed potatoes were great!  i went with the bar servers recommendation of trying the banana cream pie.  not my cup of tea but i enjoyed my pie.\n\ni enjoyed my steak, the staff and overall had a great time.  my bill before tip was $86.  i would definitely go back again!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I gave myself a few days before I wrote this review, to see if all the money I dropped on this dinner would be worth it. I've never spent so much on a dinner before, and so even with the glowing Yelp reviews, I went into this a little uneasy.\n\nMy boyfriend had paid for most of our Vegas trip, so I wanted to treat him to something special. This most definitely was.\n\nWe made reservations that morning (Thursday, so probably a slow night) for 7 pm. We arrived and were quickly seated. The decor was understated, with muted beige walls and plush brown leather chairs.\n\nThe service was impeccable. We had three waiters taking care of us! Water glasses never got more than half empty, and they were always ready to please. I asked where the women's room was, and the waiter led me there instead of just giving me directions. I really appreciated that, since the bathrooms were hidden away.\n\nLovely bathrooms though, but I expected that. A nice touch for the ladies was a basket of feminine supplies provided in case of emergency,\n\nBut now, to the main attraction: the food. Oh dear God, the food. We started with the truffle parmesan potato chips. So simple, but sooooo good.\n\nI got a rare filet mignon and the boyfriend got the bone-in rib eye medium rare. We got just one side, the cheddar bacon grits. They were good, but could have used more bacon. Then again, I think everything could use more bacon.\n\nThe meat was... quite literally the best I ever had. I love my steaks bloody, but my plate was clean until I cut into the steak. Chalk that up to a good sear and the excellent crust from the rub they use. It was kinda Cajun-y, but didn't overpower the glorious meat. It was allowed to prove itself as is and it was worth every penny.\n\nWe surprisingly still had room, so we went for dessert. I went for my old standby, the creme brulee. The boyfriend was intrigued by the root beer float with sarsaparilla sorbet. \n\nCan't screw up creme brulee, so no complaints. The sugar crust was thicker than expected, but the sweetness was offset by the chocolate shortbread cookies that came with it. Chocolatey, but not sweet. I could snack on them all day.\n\nBut the root beer float was a work of art. Came to the table in one of those tall sundae glasses, with the sarsaparilla sorbet on the bottom and vanilla ice cream on top. Waiter poured the bottle of root beer and left the rest for him.\n\nMy boyfriend is a root beer connoisseur. He used to make his own, so he knows his root beer. And he is still going crazy over that float. I think that speaks for itself.\n\nSo while at first I might have been apprehensive, I'm really glad we came here. It's out of our budget to do again anytime soon, but I definitely won't forget it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I know I know.  The veg is only giving 2 stars to the steakhouse.\n\nI wanted to like it, I did.\n\nOn our girls-weekend to Vegas, one gal requested at least one nice steak dinner.  So we did some research and ended up here.  Seated promptly at our reservation time on a Friday night after sitting only a few minutes in their version of a waiting room.\nAs others have mentioned, when you order a steak ... that's what you get.  Not a piece of parsley to garnish, nothin' else is on that plate.  Our lil steak girl said her $45 steak was .... ok.  But, and I quote, she'd had a steak with more flavor at a certain Aussie steak chain.  Girl who ordered the chicken dish loved it and said it was worth the money.  The $9 side of mashed potatoes was yummy.  Little veg here ordered their vegetable plate (not on the menu, but when I asked what was available, our waiter offered this) and it cost me $30.  For grilled veggies - carrots, two types of onion, asparagus, and .... something else.  Not even squash!  A squash ravioli was on the menu, but not being served that night.\nLoud, no bathroom inside (have to walk around the corner in the casino), and there was NO decor to the place.  Maybe that's a style, but it ain't mine.\nThe wine list is waaay extensive, almost to a fault.\nService was overwhelming in that we had four separate waiters, but chaotic.  And it was 40 minutes from ordering to getting our food.\nLast complaint - if you have a nice restaurant, insist on some kind of basic dresscode.  I don't want to have spent time looking nice and then sit next to a table full of rednecks in Tasmanian Devil cartoon shirts.\nSorry, but it isn't worth the money for herbivores or carnivores.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	i often refer to myself as Queen Cathy. Obnoxious, I know. But it's a nickname that's stuck since high school, and if that's what the people will, that's what I will be.\n\nBefitting the high standards and quality that this Queen has come to expect over the years, Las Vegas never fails to provide the top-notch EVERYTHING to entertain Queen Cathy's every whim and desire.\n\nDelmonico's. If I were the President of the US, I'd give you a Purple Heart. If I were the Queen of England, I'd grant you Knighthood.  As the Queen of CathyLand, however, I will give you the highest honor I can bestow: Five Stars on Yelp.\n\nOMFG this place is fantastic.  I'm a steakhouse junkie, and I am always looking for the next, even-better steakhouse experience.  My first visit to Delmonico's left me speechless, and all subsequent experiences have left me a raving addict.  No kidding.  if I ruled over Las Vegas, the land would see a very fat queen.\n\nThe service is IMPECCABLE.  I don't know how many people work here, but I've never seen my water glass less than half full (talk about food service taking a positive outlook on life! Haha).  It's like magic.  Before you even have a chance to THINK it, it happens on its own.  The food in an of itself is DELECTABLE.  I only order the boneless ribeye, as it's my absolute favorite cut (and I think the bone-in ribeye is their specialty).  It's flavorful, PERFECTLY seasoned, and absolutely perfectly cooked.\n\nYou see, this queen is picky.  She doesn't like to eat anything bloody. It's gross to her.  So she always ALWAYS gets her steaks well-done. While some may gasp in horror (how can you enjoy a steak WELL DONE?!), I say this, "It is true that well-done steaks tend to be dry and flat in flavor. If a steakhouse can manage to make my WELL-DONE steak juicy and flavorful, then FOR SURE it's a fantastic place!"\n\nI don't remember much about any of the sides because I'm always too busy gobbling up my steak (and still having leftovers to go!).  Many a late Las Vegas night, I'd drunkenly stumble back into my hotel room, and suddenly overcome by an urge to grub, grab my takeout box and just CHEW on a slab of leftover steak.  It's even good cold.\n\nDelmonico's, the Queen of CathyLand salutes you for outstanding service and incredible food. Cheers.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico is a terrific steakhouse, with great food and ambiance. We are from NY and have been to a lot of top notch steakhouses, so were really impressed by this restaurant.  Tom Baker made it even more memorable, great maitre d/waiter! I highly recommended Emeril's BBQ salmon and the bone-in fillet.  The real surprise were the truffle and parmesan potato chips - delicious!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	What a great find! I had eaten here once before for a corporate event, but this time it was for a nice meal with my wife.\n\nThe wine list is amazing (almost overwhelming)! Service was some of the best we've ever had! Our drinks never got below half empty and the food was outstanding! The Filet was a little (very little) tough, but the flavor was outstanding! You really cannot go wrong with this place!\n\nBAM!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place is top notch. We didn't order any appetizers as we wanted to make sure we had enough room to finish our steak. I mean that's the most important part of a steak house right? \n\nAlthough their cuts are bigger enough to split if you wanted to order a few apps and room but for us it was all steak type of night. Let's start with the ambiance it's self: like any other high end steak house very roomy and intimate setting. Lights are dim.  \n\nThe device was top notch we we greeted immediate as we sat, water came out, and wine list brought to us. It was my wife's bday so we were definitely having a glass. Their drink menu had several options of wine, cocktails, etc.  \n\nThe croissant that they bring out was fluffy and buttery. The knock is they bring you just one. I could have eaten 20. I'm sure if asked I could have had another. \n\nI ordered the bone in New York strip and I have to say it was by far the best strip I've ever had. My wife ordered the ribeye and I did try a bite. While tender and tasted well. It was slightly warmer on temp than she liked. My strip was better. But by no means was her's bad. The twice baked potato tasted awesome and we shared an order. The steak being so large we could barely eat the side. \n\nPrice point is similar to all other 4 star and up type of steak houses. It is definitely one I'd go back next time in Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Oh good lawwwwd....did someone say STEAKKK?!?!\n\nI recently came to Vegas from DC for a bachelor party and this was our one "nice" meal for the weekend. I decided to eat the Wagyu and it came with mashed sweet potato. It was sooo good. Cooked awesomely by the chef. What made it even better was eating it with the many sides we ordered. Surprisingly I loved the cream of spinach, but my favorite side was the potato gratin. Unfortunately there are so many different places to eat in Vegas...I don't know if I'll ever get to come back here.\n\nDef need to try it at least once!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Good but not great for a high end steakhouse.\n\nAtmosphere = B-\nNice tables and comfy chairs, did not care for the child crying in the distance and the place is a little small.\n\nFood = C+\nCrab cake app was good but not $20 good.  Popup bread very good.  Bone in rib eye was good but not as good as other high end steak houses in the area.  Twice baked potato was excellent.  The Banana Cream Pie looks much better than it actually is (taste like cold banana but nothing else).\n\nWatier = B+\nFriendly and responsive wait staff.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	One of the best steaks I have ever had.  Everyone at the table thoroughly enjoyed themselves.  This is what life is all about.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've been here about five times now and it never disappoints.  This is the first time I've strayed away from Ribeye..I went with the bone-in filet. And it was one of the best steaks I've ever consumed.  I seriously considered picking up the bone and gnawing on it to get more meat.  My must haves on the side are the lobster bisque and the creamed corn.  Can't wait to go back again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Quite possibly, the best steak I ever had.  Went here with my wife and made sure I had reservations.  We were seated promptly upon arrival.  The rolls were delicious, as they are in all of Emeril's restaurants.  Ordered the Lobster Bisque soup, which was incredible.  The large pieces of lobster inside the soup just made it all that much better.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my wife ordered the filet.  Both steaks were cooked perfectly and were extremely tender.  We also enjoyed the twice baked potato with our meal.  For dessert, we had to have the Banana Cream Pie.  It was absolutely fabulous.  It had chocolate shavings drizzled on top and caramel sauce on the plate.  This is not your ordinary piece of pie.  It was absolutely heaven.  We had a fantastic meal, just like we have at Emeril's other restaurants.  The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Service was exceptional here! They start off with croissant type rolls which were nice and light, followed with a small tea cup of tomato bisque, and then served your choice of a soup or salad. I ordered the lobster bisque which was exquisite, but someone else got the parmesan potato soup which they said was also exceptional. Most of our party got the filet, and everyone loved it. Lastly for dessert, I had a key lime pie all to myself and I almost ordered a second. Not too rich or heavy, and went perfect with a post-dinner coffee. Highly recommend, but very expensive.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had dinner here last week and I have one advice - Do NOT get the Prix Fix!!  We had the seafood tower, which was great except for the tuna tartare on the top - the tuna did not taste fresh at all.  Some of us got the summer prix fix option, which sounded like a great deal for $65.  All the appetizers were good, especially the tomato soup/grilled cheese.  Then the entrees came.  I had the petite ribeye, and it was seriously the worst steak I ever had.  It tasted like cheap top sirloin from Sizzler, really tough & chewy.  Emeril would be ashamed if he tasted it.  My daughter ordered off the regular menu and had the bone-in ribeye, which was delicious.  Maybe it was my fault for ordering the prix fix... I understand it's cheaper... but the quality was so poor and definitely no way near $65.  I'm giving them 2 stars for good appetizers but will be staying away from the prix fix menu.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Love going to Delmonico's almost everytime I go to Las Vegas. Great steaks, wine, and food in general. Best steak in Las Vegas!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Just as good the second time around!  Near perfect steak dinner, but not perfect.\n\nThis place is worth a repeat visit.  I really have to compliment the wait staff at this restaurant.  It seemed like there were more workers than patrons the night we were there.  \n\nCaesar Salad - I was very tempted to order an appetizer, but my gf reminded me we were about to eat over a pound of meat so we decided to share the caesar salad.  It was prepared table side by our waiter.  It was decent and a nice way to prepare my stomach for the main course.\n\nBone-in Ribeye - Mine was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  My particular cut was very, very tender.  My gf order the exact same steak and it wasn't nearly as good.  I had to share parts of my steak with her and we took the rest of hers to go.  Hers wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as mine.  \n\nSides - We ordered the creamed corn and asparagus.   The corn was very good.  It had a nice crust on the top and went well with my steak.  The asparagus was pretty plain.  I had to throw salt and pepper on it otherwise it was completely tasteless.  \n\nDessert - We ordered the banana cream pie.  I have no idea why we chose it, but I'm glad we did.  I would have usually ordered something chocolaty with ice cream but the banana cream pie sounded good.  Well, it was good.  Really good.  When it came out, I thought it was going to be way too sweet with all the caramel and chocolate shavings, but it wasn't.  We weren't even hungry after our meal, but we managed to put the entire dessert down.  \n\nOverall, the food was good.  I have to give it 4 stars for the boring asparagus and inconsistent steak.  The wait staff was awesome.  They can have 5 stars.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We walked all over the palazzo and Venetian looking at our options for a nice steakhouse. Overall, for the menu and value we went to this restaurant. By far, one of the best steakhouses we have been to in Vegas. The servers were on point, and the food was out of this world. If anything please save room and have the oatmeal crusted pecan pie with praline ice cream. It may sound a little weird, but it was the best dessert I have ever had. And I eat a lot of dessert! It wasn't overly sweet, you get an individual pie of delicious goodness! Take a break from those table games and make your way here, it will not disappoint!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Disappointed. Steak overdone while waiter have come 4 times to ask everything okay. Well will not come next time.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Over Priced!\nAll Entrees come A La Carte, basically with Nothing!\nWaiters attitude not great!\nDisappointed...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Our group of 14 was staying at the Venetian and Delmonicos was our pick for a nice fancy dinner. Since we had a night full of drinking ahead of us, we definitely didn't want to over-stuff our stomachs so each couple agreed to share a steak along with lots of appetizers and sides. \n\nTo start off, some of us had the salmon and tuna tartare, wedged salad, baked oysters, french escargot, shrimp cocktail, and lobster bisque. They were all quite tasty! \n\nThe BF and I shared a Bone-in Ribeye. Asked for medium rare but it came out medium well. I was disappointed since I really hate eating well done meat. Luckily the flavoring itself was pretty delicious or I'd definitely have to have it recooked. I also had an addition of seared Foie Gras as well - which was the absolute BEST part of my meal. The flavoring and texture was perfect and after my last bite, I found myself wanting more still!\n\nAlong with our main entree, we had an order of almost every side they had listed on their dinner menu: buttered asparagus, buttered broccoli, creamed spinach, sauteed garlic mushrooms, mash potatoes, creamed corn gratinee, and potato gratin. All the sides are meant to be shared family style and a scoop of each was more than plentiful to compliment your main course. I loved the creamed corn the most. \n\nAs full I already was, I saw expresso creme brulee on their dessert menu so of course I couldn't pass up on that. Glad I didn't either bc it was fantastic!\n\nService was excellent and our three waiters were extremely attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal. Overall, we had a pleasant dining experience. \n\n3.5 stars because my steak came out medium well instead of medium rare, but because the service was superb, 4 stars it is! Next time, get my steak right please =)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Highty recommend the Chateaubriand steak to share  -- it was melt in your mouth delicious!  It was priciest of teh 3 restaurants we ate at over the long weekend but by far the best service.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Seeing that there are so many 4 and 5 stars, I will give Delmonico in Vegas the benefit of the doubt and just say my friends and I just ordered "the wrong things". I'm writing this review half a year after eating here so I don't remember specifics, but I do remember my scallops were very salty (but tender, and huge). What wasn't huge were certain cuts of steak, which basically came in a little cube. Service was amazing though, and the decor in clean, white, and perfect lighting. The inner dining area was better looking but empty at the time, I think they were trying to seat everyone to the outer sides of the restaurants first. Overall, I had a pleasant time but wasn't wow'ed by the flavors or bill. I'll still give Delmonico here in NYC a try though.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I don't know what everyone else's problem is. This was by far the best place I have ever been to. Steak was great, server described the seasoning and cooking process and it was on point. She also told us what was good and what was just average. Very knowledgable waitress. Drinks were solid. If you don't eat here you are missing out. Well worth the price.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I thought that this steakhouse house would be an awesome meal being that it is an Emeril restaraunt and a fine dinning establisent in the Palazzo! I dont get how some people say this is the best steak they have ever had! They must either not get out much or believe the Outback Steakhouse is a fantastic place to get a steak. \n\nGreat waiters and staff that met your needs however the food doesn't compair! Now the unique style of your meal will be a delight in being the flavor of your steak or the style in which the meal is plated! I have eaten in many steakhouses and still yet nothing compares to Mastros, the ultimate steakhouse in the United States! I do give Emeril or the chef who cooked my steak credit in which the steak had an awesome flavor in every bite i took but still the meal is nothing more than average! I would give Delmonico's a 3 1/2 star!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place was recommended by a friend and I was so excited to try it. I was highly disappointed. At their price point, I expect a certain level of service and food quality. Both were lacking. After getting seated, I had to request a black napkin, which is usually automatic. Not a big deal. After waiting for 5-10 mins, perusing the menu on our own, I had to ask a busboy to find the waiter so I could order drinks. He finally came over and asked if I had any questions and proceeded to recommend the entire menu. Not helpful. We ordered the organic green salad which was excellent. Also got the bone in ribeye. I liked the way it was charred on the outside but it was not well seasoned and the meat quality wasn't top notch like other steakhouses I've been to. The manager came by to do their customary check and I told him the steak was 'pretty good'. He didn't bother asking me why I wasn't satisfied, smiled and walked away.\n\nOverall, this place doesn't command the price they're charging. Need to clean up their service and food quality. If the salad was the best thing we ate at a steakhouse, that's definitely a problem.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I'm not a chaser of celebrity chefs...and wasn't excited to hit up Emerils joint in V-town. But I have to say. I was diggin' this place. \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty chill and classy. It made me want to sip cognac and smoke a cigar ( and I don't like either of those). This place definitely exudes a mid-western meets Palm Springs sort of vibe. You know... big comfy, light taupe leather chairs, with hearty dark wood tables and high nicely lit ceilings. \n\nMy food was good. The Foie Gras was amazing, the endive  salad was nice but not out of this world and the lamb special was good too. With very hearty servings of meat I couldn't finish my lamb, though if it were outrageously good I probably would have. \n\nAnd yes if offered to me, I sampled the dishes from around the table). Of note: the bone-in rib eye was very nice and the fondue was ridiculously good. I passed on the fish. (Come on Craig - who orders fish at a steakhouse?) Between the foie gras, fondue and lamb, it's amazing I walked out on my own. Never fear... red wine was there to save my ateries. (Whew! )\n\nWe passed on dessert. So no report there.\n\nWe sat a few tables away from D. Rodman. It's amazing how grown men in their 50's will say shout out stupid stuff like: "Yo D.R.? Can I get a Whoop Whoop?" when they're in the presence of an ex pro athlete. Funny stuff.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My boyfriend and I stop in here for dinner quite often while in Las Vegas. Chateaubriand w/ asparagus and au-gratin potatoes is on hit! Incredible wine list and their wait staff is extremely friendly. They don't have late hours like other restaurants, I think they close around 10 or 11pm (which is way early) but still a good place to check out.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Our 1st time to Vegas and my husband loves Emeril, so we went with 3 other people.  Our waiter Ryan was just amazing!  Our food was divine!  We had such a good experience, when we go to Vegas we will definitely come here again.  I would recommend it to anyone!  Key Lime pie was so good!  We all liked the banana cream pie as well.  My Filet was to doe for.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My wife and I came here for our anniversary celebration last week. We had a show to attend at the Wynn so we needed to dine locally; I was debating on dining at CUT again or here but due to the high yelp reviews we decided to give Delmonico's a try.  I made reservations one month in advance online and notated our special occasion. \nUpon entry we were both promptly greeted, seated and our anniversary celebration was acknowledged - which was much appreciated. Service was kind, professional and very efficient but unfortunately the food - lacked significantly. \n\nWe both began with the recommended BBQ Shrimp appetizer - which was phenomenal, but unfortunately that's where our ecstasy of taste buds had ended.\n\nI ordered my long awaited alleged highly reviewed bone in rib eye with a side of foie gras, mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms. \n\nTo my unfortunate disappoint - the steak had tasted no different than a steak purchased from your local grocery store. For the price point and most importantly the anticipation I had for their signature steak from the world renowned chef, it DID NOT hit the spot. Although the steak came out at a perfect temperature and presentation was adequate, it did not at all taste like a typical dry aged high grade meat - very bland and mediocre, tasted no seasonings or flavor. We should have gone to Mastros or I would have at least been better off going back to CUT, although I didn't like the fact that CUT brings out their steaks lukewarm (due to resting) or not even on a hot plate - but you definitely get the high end meat quality and the explosion of flavors - hands down by far is 100% better.\n\nMy wife had ordered the Mediterranean Sea bass since she wasn't in the mood for steak and as well to her disappointment it was a lackluster, flavorless dish. All in all it was a very disheartening anniversary meal after a month's of high anticipation especially with all of the other fine dining options we had in Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I really enjoyed my experience in here. Its an expensive place so save it for a special night out, unless you're wealthy, than feel free to splurge all you want. \n\nFrom the outside, the restaurant seems small, but once you walk in you'll see its a lot bigger and most of their clients are seated there instead. Spacious seating and dim lighting, everyone is dressed up.\n\nMy party tried out:\n\nAppetizer: Emeril's shrimp, it wasn't bad. I was delicious, but not necessarily memorable or jaw dropping. Our waiter recommended it to us and it wasn't a bad choice.\n\nSoup: Lobster bisque, delicious!!! This is the best lobster bisque I've had in recent memory. A lot of the bisques I've had always added too much wine into so the wine flavor killed the lobster's, but this one was well balanced! Kudos!\n\nEntrees: BBQ Salmon, genuinely surprised at how delicious this was. Moist, flavorful, but not overbearing. Potato hash and onion strips went well with it. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes too, which was great. The waiter warned me that I had a lot of potatoes, but I don't mind. Plus, I shared my mash with my party. Other members in my party had the filet mignon and ribeye. I'm not a particular fan of ribeye because of its texture, but they managed to make me like it. \n\nWe didn't order any dessert, but we did have a few cups of Blue Mountain to end the evening. Soothing, relaxing, and it was a perfect ending to a nice meal.\n\nThe service was great, our waiter was very efficient, honest, and attentive. No snobby elitist attitude, which is always appreciated. The price is expensive, but what do you expect? Its Vegas! You're going to be spending a lot if you want to have a good time here.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico's has good steak and appetizers. The atmosphere is okay and the interior design needs to be improved, but the food is delicious. The bread and butter was both cold.boo. The lobster soup was salty.eh. The barbecue shrimp is good. The rib-eye was really fatty. eh. The strip steak was yummy! The portions are big too. I wouldn't mind going back for the food, but I wasn't into their scene.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Loved it! Went to Delmonico Steakhouse a few days ago with a group of friends, and absolutley loved the food and the service. \n\nThe Service:  The service was impeccable.  I've seen better (well only one other place could beat their service) but Delmonico put Ruth's Chris and Mortons to SHAME. Yes, I said it... to shame.  That's how great they are. Drank one inch of water, and was immediately refilled with another inch.  Drank one inch of wine, and was immediately refilled.  Food was brought on very reasonable time.  Though if I could complain, I would've wanted the staff to be a little more friendlier.  Felt they were being a little less friendly because of our age.  But I'll let it slide.\n\nThe food: I can complain NOTHING about the food! The food was fantastic.  The best steak I've ever ate, hands down! Was worth every penny (or should I say dollar).  Even the baked potato was super good (and it's just a regular baked potato!) Its as good as it gets.\n\nI would highly recommend this place for a business meeting or a date.  It's just a wonderful eating experience.  Would definitely come back again, Emeril did not disappoint!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is my 3rd visit to Delmonico and unfortunately I have to lowered my rating.\n\nThis is mainly for the service. You would imagine a fine dining establishment like Delmonico would give you top notch service when you're there, it was average at best.\n\nI ordered a glass of wine, the bone in rib eye, the bone in new york, cream of corn, and a twice baked potato. The server kept insisting we add an appetizer and a half bottle of wine to our order. I know its their job to encourage customers to order more, but I had a sense the server felt like I wasn't spending enough to justify exceptional service.\n\nThis may be a pet-peeve of mine, but I hate it when the server doesn't bring you the bill nor does he bring you back the bill after you paid. The runner did this. The runner also was the one who asked if I would like dessert. I know its a busy restaurant, but the server could have brought back the bill and asked if I enjoyed everything (what if something was wrong?). Again this is a pet-peeve of mine.\n\nRatings for the food:\n\nBone in Rib Eye: 5/5 stars\nBone in New York: 4/5 stars\nCream of Corn: 5 stars\nTwice Baked Potato: 4/5 stars\nRegular Idaho Potato (from a previous stay): 3/5 stars\nCalamari (from a previous stay): 3/5 stars\nDinner Rolls: 5/5 stars
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went for restaurant week lunch. Decent cocktails. Great service. Good tomato burrata salad. Banana pudding was okay. Salmon was on point. Burger was perfect.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	One of my favorite steakhouse!   Been here a couple of times and never disappoints.   Great rib eye, very tender and cooked to perfection. Great service and excellent appletini!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is has been on my list for a while, so it was one of my first choices for Spring Restaurant Week this year. I came here for lunch during the week with fellow Yelpers and we took advantage of their $30.14 prie fixe menu (Three Square $4 donation). I also utilized Open Table to make my reservation.\n\nThe three of us started with the Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad for our appetizer. The fresh heirloom tomatoes (2-3 different types/colors) were served with a dollop of creamy Burrata cheese, red onion, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and fresh local basil. Really crisp and refreshing; great start to our meal.\n\nFor the entrée, I selected the Delmonico's Prime Hamburger served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, and the usual fixings (lettuce, tomato, onion). It was perfectly medium rare with juices oozing out with every squeeze. The burger had great flavor and seasoning, so that made it stand out from other burgers I've had. It was also an extremely generous portion. I could barely finish half of it (and I eat A LOT). My only complaint was that although the burger started out juicy and delicious, it dried out really quickly and made it almost difficult to eat. I'm not sure what attributed to this, but it was odd. The fries were delicious! A unique preparation of crispiness.\n\nI also had the opportunity to taste the Butternut Squash Ravioli prepared with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese and Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon served with a sweet corn and crab vinaigrette and fresh basil. Both were really delicious! The salmon was so soft with a succulent rareness in the center of the filet. I was also really impressed with the large chunks of crab meat and whole kernels of corn.\n\nFor dessert, I opted for the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Bread Pudding with Vanilla Bean Crème Anglaise. I'm glad someone else chose Emeril's Banana Cream Pie because it was a tough decision for me (both being my favorite desserts). The bread pudding was moist, warm, and very yummy. The pecan caramel-like sauce was a bit sweet, but fortunately, the pudding was not. The banana cream pie was topped with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. Yum. It was good, but I'll have to order one in the future to get a really good taste of it.\n\nThe restaurant is nice and I like the dimly lit rooms with spotlights on each table. It wasn't very busy during our meal, but I'm sure it would still be that nice and quiet. The service was also phenomenal. I was extremely pleased with the offering of Harney & Sons tea (transported in the most gorgeous wooden box display) and the fact that it was complimentary. Everyone was so prompt to refill my pot with hot water and of course, it was served with fresh lemon and honey. We also stayed past their lunch service and they were so kind to allow us to loiter for that long.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I came here back in 2005 with my family and had a phenomenally memorable meal. Six years later -- I came back this past weekend and it was STELLAR. Extensive wine list, excellent service, ridiculously buttery brioche bread, great cocktails, and of course, the food!\n\nFor apps, my party had the truffle chips (so rich but delish!), squash ravioli with duck confit (superb), lobster bisque (mmm with large lobster chunks), and the wedge salad (as perfect as a classic wedge gets). \n\nFor entrees, I had the filet mignon that was PERFECTLY cooked to a true medium-rare. I often find that, when I order med-rare, more often than not, highly rated restaurants overcook my meat to more of a med to med-well, which is can be disappointing. Well, here at Delmonico, it was PERFECT! Friends got the bone-in ribeye and the huge $85 Fred Flinstone steak (I forget the official name), all cooked to perfection. The 2007 Joseph Phelps Cab paired divinely with the steaks. \n\nSides:  creamed corn was mind-blowing; creamed spinach was good but didn't knock my socks off (compared to everything else which did). \n\nWe were too stuffed to order a dessert, but we received a complimentary birthday gelato. Nice gesture, but it was not so great -- I think it was a non-conventional flavor, like fennel or something?\n\nOverall, I would definitely return the next time I'm in the mood for a (pricey) steak dinner in Vegas!!! Emeril is a genius!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Food amazing, mushrooms and Rack of lamb were excellent. Truffle chips so addicting! I had made an advance reservation and made a comment that it was my boyfriends birthday and asked for a special table. When we arrived the hostess seated us at a table 2 feet from other guests on one side and up against a wall on the other side. When I asked her if they had a nicer table she said that the dining room was full. Then she looked around and asked what table I wanted. I told her that I had requested a nice cozy table when I made my reservation. I was disappointed in the location of the table especially since I had made that specific request. She then moved us to a table that was right next to the entrance and sound volume buttons/lighting controls of the restaurant. It also was not what I expected but at least we weren't right next to another group. Throughout dinner the managers were constantly walking by and playing with the volume buttons and lighting buttons on the wall. On a good note , our server and the food was exceptional however I have been to several fine dining restaurants and was disappointing that my small request was not granted. It's the little things that make a difference.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The BBQ shrimp and truffle chips are excellent.  We were a party of 3 and 2 of the filets came out way under cooked and the bone out ribeye looked like it was purchased at the local super market. Looked like a $10 casino special steak not a $51 one. I have made better at home.  I was very disappointed based on the other reviews.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	10/27/2016-I had my birthday dinner here and it was worth the splurge.  I have to say something about the décor - it was too plain and sterile and I expected a little more character from this establishment.  I would have added some wood paneling or some framed mirrors.  But the food was worth it.  We ordered the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp, Butternut Squash Ravioli, Traditional New Orleans Gumbo, and of course the 16 oz Rib Eye steak.  Our side dishes included the Country Smashed Potato, Delmonico Creamed Spinach, Buttered Fresh Asparagus, and Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms.  All the dishes we ordered were delicious.  Our steak was medium rare and it was sooo good.  The meat was tender with the right amount of fatty goodness.  My favorite sides were the asparagus (cooked just right, not over or under cooked) and the mushrooms.  The creamed spinach was a little too salty for me.  They added a nice touch to my birthday by serving complimentary appetizer and dessert (mango sorbet)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Whenever I am in Vegas, I want to try Food Network Chef restaurants so for this trip we went and tried Emeril's Delmonico.... and was not blown away. Its either I had high expectations but other than enjoying the bread, their steaks and lobster bisque was little on the salty side (and I enjoy salty). Their salmon with the chorizo hash was pretty acceptable....but they are a steakhouse, so I expected more from their steaks! Not worth the $50 value....Binion's prime rib was way better and more reasonably priced!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We love Delmonico and eat here every time in Vegas. However, our meal was disappointing. The highlight of the meal was our appetizer & desert. We started with the truffle chips, which was a good portion. We both then ordered steaks, NY strip and bone in ribeye and shared the twice baked potato. My steak was over cooked, as I requested medium rare and it was over cooked.  We finished our meal with the pecan pie for desert. We will be probably be back, just hope for better next time.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I have had steaks @ many great steakhouses the bone in rib eye is by far the best I've ever had. My wife ordered the salmon and it was excellent. We ordered corn and fingerling potatoes as sides. Both were good but wish I would have gotten something other than the fingerling potatoes. Overall great service, amazing steak & salmon highly recommend!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Impeccable service and outstanding steaks!  But then again what do you expect it's Emeril and Las Vegas!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The steakhouse is like most traditional steakhouses. The decor was very clean and contemporary. The hostesses weren't all that attractive and would rate about a 5-6 in my scale of looks and their demeanor looked as if they did not really care to be there at all. \n\nThe dining area is half filled with patrons and business people alike chatting away about their day and how excellent the steak was prepared The beautiful burgundy high leather chairs is a nice touch and their seating area is plush and soft. The booth seating is a high suede sofa like seating and the tables were all lined with clean white linens and set in standard of most fine dining establishments. \n\nI took my seat and I was greeted by the waiter and the captain and was asked about my choice of entree. I decided to go with their Filet Mignon and go with my good instincts that this would be the best choice. The chef prepared all the appetizers for a sampling. Classic jumbo shrimp cocktail, Parmesan truffle chips, classic Caesar salad, fried calamari, and mixed green salad. \n\nThe classic jumbo shrimp cocktail with a extremely spicy cocktail sauce wasn't as good as I expected. The shrimp were cooked well and the shrimp were presented beautifully, however, the spicy cocktail sauce did not please my taste buds or my nostrils for that matter. The sauce was like eating a handful of Wasabi.\n\n The extremely addicting truffle Parmesan chips were EXCELLENT and should be ordered every time any patron enters this restaurant. The chips were drizzled with truffle oils and shaved Parmesan cheese and each individual chip melted as you put them in your mouth. \n\nThe classic Caesar salad had much to desire. The way the salad was prepared was not my idea of a good salad. It was literally a huge chunk of romaine lettuce with the heart in tact served with a plain and unappealing Caesar dressing. I don't like how fancy restaurants can slap a big chunk of romaine lettuce on a plate and call it a classic Caesar salad just to be different. Don't mess with a good thing!\n\nThe fried calamari was ok at best, not my favorite but definitely worth a taste. The mixed green salad was a way a salad should be prepared and had just the right amount of dressing. The waiter was attentive and knew what drinks were ordered. The plates were cleared but seemed like sometimes dead plates were left around. Not a good sign of service. \n\nThe entree finally came and the presentation could have been better but the Filet was ammmmazing. The steak knife cut through the Filet like a butter knife through room temperature butter. The steak was cooked to medium rare perfectly and encrusted with some New Orleans style spices. I truly enjoyed the Filet till the very last bite. One thing I do have to mention is the dessert. I would highly recommend the famous Emeril's banana cake. This thing was pure heaven and was absolutely delicious. I could not even describe it in words if I even tried so I won't! So you will have to try it for yourself. \n\nOverall the experience was good, food was good but not the best I have tried, and the service was ok by my standards, but my standards can be high. My favorite parts were the Filet and the dessert, the appetizers once again could have been better with the exception of the truffle chips, mmm! delicious! I would recommend this place for dinner or lunch, however, the price can be a little daunting. I was calculating the totals of a appetizer, entree, and dessert and was estimating about 70-100 dollars a person with tip. That can look a little scary for some people, but for the meal and experience I'd say that was definitely worth it! Many thanks for reading. Till next time.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	There's a reason this place has been here for 10 years & is still going strong amidst the Vegas mahem of new hot restaurants with celebrity chefs. \n\nThis was my 2nd visit to Delmonico's & it's still my favorite steak restaurant of all time. I hope when I die I have a meal from here in my belly :)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Maybe because I'm use to NY Steakhouses but I was disappointed. \nI was with a party of 10 for lunch. Lunch menu was great however my steak was over cooked. \n\nWhere's the porterhouse steaks???\n\nWine was good but little expensive, even for Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Celebrated my daughter's birthday here as it was her desire to dine here again, and everything was fabulous! My daughter & my husband shared the Chateaubriand with asparagus & mashed potatoes, and I ordered the Filet Mignon Au Poivre which was wonderful... Starters equalled Lobster Bisque & Butternut Squash Ravioli which were excellent as well... Impeccable service & the highest Quality food & preparation were greatly appreciated for a special occasion for our family! Thank you for a memorable evening!\nBanana Cream Pie for Bday dessert was ridiculously great & enough for many to share!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	It was above average, not great. Went with my daughter and we both had the filet mignon, the steaks tasted great but were cooked inconsistently. The surprise hit was the appetizer - tuna carpaccio which was simply amazing and made the meal.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico is another place that I've eaten at a number of times (over a span of close to 10 years), and it is always consistently fantastic.  The food, especially the steak, is always wonderful; however, the menu does not change often.  Thankfully, with items like the gumbo on the list, the stale menu isn't as big a problem as it could be at other fine dining establishments.  As you would expect, the steaks are incredible, and Delmonico is home to my favorite filet in Vegas.  The dessert leave a bit to be desired, but I am generally way to full to be bothered with dessert anyways.\n\nThe service here can be hit and miss, and it seems to depend on where in the restaurant you are seated - up front by the entrance and you're being hounded by a swarm of waiters, runners, and sommeliers, while if you're seated toward the back of the restaurent, you tend to be a bit underserved.  The atmosphere is definitely a bit stuffy, but that doesn't stop the occasional jackass in a football jersey or cowboy hat from sitting down at the table next to you.  \n\nOverall a great restaurant, however I would recommend Table 10 in the Palazzo.  Table 10, another Emeril establishment, is far less stuffy and has a very similar menu and food quality, at about two-thirds the cost of Delmonico.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A-okay! Was at this restaurant this past Saturday for a bday dinner. \n\nThe atmosphere was cool and what you'd expect from a high end steakhouse. However it is located in the Venetian hotel which has seriously gone downhill from the last time I was there (maybe '05-'06).\n\nService was great, and friendly too. However the food was ehhh, on the border of "ok." I ordered a filet cooked medium, but I got well (even burnt along edges). My bf ordered the ribeye cooked medium, and he got a true medium - a little pink inside, nicely cooked outside & edges. Our table shared mushrooms (wouldn't recommend, bland), country mashed and au gratin potatoes (both ok), corn (tasty!), and creamed spinach... Only thing was, we never got it. I think we were so busy eating and talking that we didn't realize it till afterwards. I guess it happens.\n\nSo all in all, this place is ok. It doesn't rank above the norm, nor would I drag it down... It's a middle of the road type steakhouse. With so many amazing options in Las Vegas, I'd recommend you try another one before here (STK, Chef Ramsey's).
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	45 minutes between clearing appetizers & being served dinner. Extremely disappointed in meal & service. Went here a few times years ago months after it's opening when both food & service were phenomenal. Seems like different place, so we'll be going elsewhere in the future.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've been here a few times.... All I have to say is....Finally a place that knows how make a steak!  I came here for dinner and lunch.  I also had a chance to try their burger. The juiciest and tastiest burger I have ever had. I would definitely come back for future meals as well as recommend this place to others.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AWEFUL bone-in ribeye. AVERAGE/BLAND/DRY au-gratin potatoes. GOOD lobster bisque.\nBoth mine and my husband's rib-eyes were gristly and fatty (neither had marbling that is found in good cuts of meat). About 25% to 30% of our steaks were gristle and fat, which we left on our plates. We both thought the seasoning was boring, but we know that's a matter of preference. \nWe eat at nice steakhouses (Del Frisco's, Ruth's Chris, Brook's, Morton's, Elway's, Shannahan's) a couple of times a year, so we think we know about quality steak. Our steak and au-gratin potatoes were something a casual dining restaurant like Chili's or Applebee's would serve.\nStaff was pleasant.\nOur demogs: mid-40's, professionally employed, live in Colorado.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We ate dinner for our Anniversary and lunch on our final day. Food was so tasty and my hubby is still raving about the Bone-in steak, the salmon was moist and succulent. Jumbo prawn cocktail, lobster bisque, lobster sliders, specialty drinks Tale of Two Cherries Oysters on half shell... I can go on and on Rene, Lamont and Dominique were top notch service experts!!  #vegasfinedining #betterthandelicious
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This has to be the best steakhouse i have ever been to in my life. I would recommend anybody who is dining at the strip to try this once. This is a great steakhouse, reservations are a must as we went at 5pm on a Thursday and they were pretty much full and they open at 5. \n\nThe restaurant is right next to the theaters in between the Venetian and palazzo. The place is huge and the service is excellent.\n\nWe ordered the chateaubriand steak for two which was 18oz and they carved the steak and cooked it to perfection right on tableside. We also got the mashed potatoes along with creamy spinach for the sides but just the steak alone was so tasty you don't really bother with the sides even though we did. \n\nThe server was super professional and from start to finish they crushed it and made sure we enjoyed the dinner.\n\n5 stars all the way. This is the restaurant which deserves more as lots of places get the 5 star rating. Delmonico should open up a place in South Florida so i don't have to go to Vegas just to enjoy a steak, just a suggestion.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	* Good Food * Good Service * Patrons Love People Watching* Pricey Food *\n\n1) Crab Salad - Good stuff\n2) Ahi Ahi Entrée - tasted like steak mMmm.  If everything tasted like this and was not meat, I can definitely turn vegetarian\n\nAnd then I ate off some of the girls' plates at the table, which include potatoes and asparagus - both were delish!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Pros:\n1. Was at a chefs table overlooking the kitchen shielded though\n2. Excellent all around for 6 people\n3. Excellent service, our famous chef and two servers\n4. It was fun for all\n5 Love the black grilled carrots, very tasty said from the amazon jungle\n6. I could have rated it 4 1/2 stars, I really enjoyed the evening at LAS\n7. Deserts were off the chart, an indulgence for all\n\nCons:\n1. Lamb from Colorado was OK, not great it was medium cooked, so it was a little chewy since I prefer medium rare.\n2. Really none\n\n I recommend it highly. Damage was reasonable, we will be back!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Rib eye steak for $51 should be pretty darn good.  What I got was not as tender and not as flavorful as the rib eye served by our local Texas Roadhouse.  And, of course almost three times the cost.  Actually, more than three times the cost, since the entrée comes all by itself, and you pay separately for any sides.  My wife's pork chop was huge, but virtually raw in the center.  The server explained to us that this was the "correct" way to serve pork nowadays.  Apparently we're behind the times, because we prefer not to eat raw pork.  She did enjoy the part of the chop that was cooked, though.  By the way, my steak was a bit more than lukewarm.  I kind of like steak that's hot.\n\nThe restaurant was very loud, and became substantially noisier as the table of eight drunks behind us got more and more drunk.  Shouting, screaming, maniacal laughter filled the section of the restaurant where we, unfortunately, were seated near them.  No one from the Delmonico's staff or management did anything to ameliorate this situation, and the drunks stayed (and got louder) long after they had finished eating.  But not finished drinking.\n\nThis is one of those steak houses where there's a primary server and then a team of two or three ancillary servers.  None of them were initially friendly, although the primary server warmed up a bit.  The others came and went almost instantaneously, with minimal contact.  For example, one server brought a couple of small popovers for each of us.  Almost tossing them onto plates, he muttered "Enjoy your bread" -- and was gone.  A small magic act, more impressive than the food.\n\nI really can't think of any reason for us to go back, and would not recommend this place to anyone.  But your mileage may vary.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I usually love Delmonicos but my last trip kept me wanting more. Maybe I was too hungover to thoroughly enjoy my meal, but on this blurry Saturday night everything was very mediocre for me. We started off with the steak tartare and the bbq shrimp. The steak tartare was very good. It was fresh, clean and delicious. The bbq shrimp was good, but for $18 for 4 shrimps, I wanted them to be a party in my mouth, and in this case, they were not. I ordered a medium rare rib eye. It was cooked to absolute perfection. Nice crust and juicy pink center. I marveled at the perfection of my steak. Although it was slightly under seasoned it was still juicy and delicious.\n\nDelmonico's is probably one of the best if not thee best steakhouses I've been to. Their service is spectacular and on point every time I've been. They really do hire the best of the best. Attentive but not overbearing servers.  Delmonicos puts out some amazing and good quality food. If you go, you must try their lobster bisque, it's luscious, creamy and definitely worth the calories. Potato gratin is definitely one of their best sides also. And of course, don't every steer from what you came for, the STEAK!\n\nEmeril, you slightly let me down this time, but I still remember how good you've been to me the last times. I'll be back to let you redeem yourself.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I had dinner here on 2/7.  The last time I was here was over 10 years ago.  The last Vegas steakhouse that I had eaten at was CUT, so that is what I will be comparing my experience to.\nService:  Very Good.  We had at least 3-4 servers taking care of us (party of 5) throughout the night.  Initially dinner was for a party of 4.  However, once we were seated, our buddy landed at the airport and decided to join us.  I informed the head server (thinking that they may not be able to accommodate) and he immediately converted the table to seat 5 (pulled out stuff from the bottom to make it a round table).  Water was constantly filled and table cleared off in appropriate fashion.\nFood:  We started off with the Caesar Salad and Ahi Tuna/Salmon tartare.  I thought the salad was just ok.  A tad too much dressing.  Same with the tartare.  Nothing special and pretty bland.  Most of the group got the bone in rib eye (medium rare to medium well).  All were cooked well.  I thought the medium rare tasty pretty good.  Nothing spectacular about it, just good steak.  I had the rack of lamb (medium rare) and it had decent flavors.  I would take Carvino's lamb chops over it any day.  The sides we had were decent (Potato gratin, mushrooms, and corn).  We had a nice bottle of wine that the Sommelier recommended with a price point of $85.  That was probably the best tasting thing of the night.\nThe verdict on Delmonico's is that it is a decent steakhouse that it's reputation is based on its name more than its food.  I would choose CUT over it any day.  They have more selection of meat (cuts and quality).
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Why you ask is a vegan giving a steakhouse 4 stars? Actually, why is a vegan even going to a steakhouse at all? Because she's probably adopted and the preferred twin was given the luxury of choosing the restaurant for the night. Sometimes I dream of the green parents that celebrated every monumental event at Cafe Gratitude and unfortunately had to leave me behind. In Concord. Either way-my family is screwed up.\n\nBack to Delmonico's, this is actually my second visit, first time was in 2000. Even then they accommodated my needs. Now they actually have a vegetarian option but alas, no vegan dish. \n\nNo problem-when you've so obviously been dragged along to a place with a bunch of meat eaters, people sometimes take pity on you. It's kind of fun to tell people what you absolutely will not tolerate and see what they give you. Dating should be more like this but that's another review. I was served pasta with different veggies like asparagus and green beans. Not amazing but not bad. An A for effort.\n\nI should probably mention the dead animals that Delmonico's specializes in. Yes-they're dead. But my family loved what they ordered and sucked the bones dry.\n\nExcellent service and the bartender made a tasty kir royal.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place is amazing!!!! Came here for an annual post-Christmas celebratory dinner and we were pleased with the food as well as the service. They served us a complimentary tomato mousse on a puff pastry to start and for being a single bite, it was packed full of flavor! I knew we were in for a treat. Ordered steak tartare for an appetizer and fell in love. It comes with an egg yolk over the top which gives it a wonderful velvety taste. Decent portion although I could have eaten much more. Next we shared the tomato and burrata salad. The burrata was the best I've had....so creamy and rich. Delicious! For our entree, we shared the Chateaubriand. Holy crap was it amazing! The first bite literally melted in my mouth. It's served with asparagus which was super fresh and crisp. We substituted fingerling potatoes for the mashed potatoes and were very happy with our decision. We also added foie gras, which was delicious. I seriously could eat the steak ever day though.... It's one of the best I've ever had. For dessert, we were interested in the bread pudding but went with the suggestion of 2 different servers and ordered the pecan pie. Holy shit it was incredible. Not your typical pecan pie....it's made with oats and love and magic. It was the perfect end to a fantastic meal. We come to Vegas and splurge on a nice dinner once a year, typically going somewhere new each time, but there's a chance we'll make a repeat visit next year. The service was on point throughout...the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, not stuffy or arrogant at all like some places. Thank you, Delmonico!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I try not to eat any restaurants inside the hotels.... But this is and exception. This place is amazing. When we walked in the employees were so nice they greeted us and pulled our chairs out for us. The best part was the food. We both got steak and let me tell you that beef was so delicious. Worth every penny. I recommend anyone to at least try it
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	delicious! but i was way too full from eating the days before to completely enjoy this place.\n\nwe started out with calamari and crab cakes. im not that into calamari but i thought the crab cakes were wonderful. the lobster bisque was super rich and creamy. yum. and it comes with what i thought was bread, but when you stir it into the soup, the bread somehow melts into great big chunks of lobster.\n\neverybody got steak and i went with the ahi tuna, cuz i figured i could just get a taste of their steak. that didn't really go to plan cuz i just ended up eating everyone else's steak, especially my friend's bone in rib steak (med rare). hehe. but the tuna was still very good.\n\nended dessert with the bread pudding and creme brulee. i liked the bread pudding more because it was hot and it was topped off nicely with ice cream.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Dined there last weekend with some friends and we were utterly disappointed. Not impressed one bit.\nI don't understand how this restaurant received such high ratings, but I certainly would not go back nor would I recommend to anyone.\nFrom the food, the service, the ambiance - huge let down.\n\nI would've given this place an additional star if the service wasn't so terrible.  The server was slow and was more interested in chatting.  Also, we waited at least 30 min to get our entrees(they didn't even seem busy). \nAfter our table was cleared from apps and salads, we waited 20+ min before calling our server to check up on our food. She said it was still within the "window" and she couldn't do anything. Luckily, she spoke to her manager after another 5-10 min because that's when our food was "officially late." \n\nWhat we had (from what I can recall):\nBBQ Shrimp - shrimps were cooked unevenly and drowned in mediocre BBQ sauce. Some were cooked well, but mine was under. \nVine-Ripened Tomato Salad - nothing special\nBaked Crab Stuffed Lobster - lobster tail cooked well, but tough to eat and nothing amazing\nNY Strip - no flavor\nFilet - nice crust from the Essence stuff\nSauteed Garlic Mushrooms - standard\nPotato Gratin - bit on the dry side\nCreamed Corn Gratin - best side order we had on the table, but that doesn't mean much.\n\nDessert:\nSorbet, banana cream pie, apple fritters, key lime pie.\nThe desserts and our bottle of wine were probably the highlight of this dinner.\n\nIf you are looking for a good steakhouse on the strip, this is NOT the place.\nYou'll probably have better luck at Mastro's, Stripsteak, Prime, or Craftsteak.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My quest for trying all the highly rated steakhouses in Vegas brought me to Delmonico. And I wasn't disappointed. \n\nMy prime rib-eye steak was cooked perfectly (mid-rare), seasoning was spot on and your steak wont be distracted by a pool of butter.\nTry topping it with a generous piece of Foie Gras if you don't mind the occasional stoppage of the heart.\n\nUnlike alot of other steakhouse where you feel cramped, and surrounded by ear deafening drunks, at Delmonico the ceiling is high, tables are placed with room to run around (not recommended). And you have ample room to stretch your stomach and legs while not eavesdropping on the other table's encounter with "girls directly to your room".\n\nI would love to give Delmonico 5-stars, however, their sides had a lackluster performance. A little adventure wouldn't hurt, it is Vegas afterall.\n\nSo my quest continues with N9NE and Stripsteak coming up in a month. Good Luck to me!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Dinner was just awesome! \n\nWe started with the wilted spinach frisee with the poached egg and carmelized bacon... so good. \nI had the halibut--perfectly cooked & flaky \nMy friend had the bone-in ribeye, cooked perfectly \n\nWe finished it off with the chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream...OMG. \n\nI'm not a coffee drinker but the my friends also had the Jamaican french press which they loved. \n\nMichael Jackson was our server-- very attentive and added to the beautiful experience.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This restaurant is world class. It is one of the top steakhouses that I have been too. I would rate it in better than a ruth chris, ditka's, chop house and in the same category as a shula's or capitol grill.\n\nThe service is 5* as they have 3+ waiters taking care of you constantly, but not overbearing. Type of place where you leave to use the washroom and you  come back to the table and with a folded napkin and a refilled water glass.\n\nLove the appetizers, my wife believes it they have the best lobster bisque soup out there.\n\nThe steak's are great sizes and range from $42-$50, but you're truly getting what you pay for. For the dolts who dinged this place because of the cost, if you want a piece of grizzle for $20 then go to outback.\n\nWhenever my wife and I come to vegas and we need to celebrate something, this is the restaurant we do it at.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The bone-in rib eye is easily the highlight of this steakhouse. The medium rare steak had excellent flavor along with the marbled fat that simply melted in my mouth. The oysters, ahi tuna & salmon tartare, butternut squash ravioli, and bbq shrimp are all excellent choices for starters and the potato gratin is a good side dish to have the steak with. The wine list is very extensive, but if you're not up for all that intensive reading, they also have a very knowledgeable staff to make recommendations. I was a little disappointed with peppermint profiteroles which were a little too stiff for my liking. Service was great and efficient. I must have had my water glass filled 7-8 times that night. Pricing is relatively decent - entrees around $50 and starters/sides/deserts around $10-$15 each.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Efficient Service, Quiet and Great Food\n\nIt has been 4 years since I ate here and so on my last day in Vegas, I stopped for lunch. The food as usual was excellent. Tried their tuna which was cooked just perfect. My buddy had a burger which he tells me was very tasty.\n\nLove the fact that this place has maintained such great quality over the years.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I was so impressed with the sister restaurant in New Orleans that I opted to make a reservation here for hubby's bday.  We arrived an hour early for our reservation and they were able to seat us.  They sent over a complimentary amuse bouche of steak sate that wowed us while we enjoyed an outstanding Pomegranite Martini and Key Lime Martini.  For people who love wine, the menu is extensive and expensive.  Overall, the food was good (don't order the creamed spinach, it tastes like Birds' Eye frozen), and the service was excellent (thanks, George!).  Pricey, but knew that heading in, and the cuts of meat and preparation met were worth the $$$$ price.  The special salad that evening (mixed baby greens with lavendar and baby brie turnovers and candied pecans was much better than my proscioutto (chewy slab, not shaved) and mozzarella.  A nice place for a special dinner.  Overall I have to say I enjoyed the food at the NOLA location but liked the sophisticated atmosphere and vibe of this Venetian restaurant better.  Glad we went but next time I'm in Vegas not sure I wouldn't head back without trying another similar restaurant first.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Exquisite in every sense of the word!\n\nGet ready for a dining experience like no other, with all the choices to dine in Las Vegas, this is something extraordinary! We walked in and were warmly greeted by the hostesses and seated quickly in the beautiful dining room of classic romantic design. Our table was impeccably set with china banded in red, trimmed in gold, similar to that of the GW Bush era at the White House. We had a friendly, attentive staff of four serving us our Chateaubriand, sauteed tableside, that was so tender and done to perfection the knives we were given surely were for decoration - we did not need to use them. I highly recommend this dining experience if you are interested in a romantic, classic setting with a menu and wine list fit for the king and queen that you are :) Do give the Duck Egg Creme Brulee' a try - it was marvelous!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Las Vegas has steak houses everywhere you look.  Delmonico Steakhouse is one of the better ones.  I ate dinner at the bar, where a full menu is available.  Overall the meal was very good:  very good foie gras; an excellent bone-in rib eye steak with three sauces (barnaise, A-OK [like a fancy version of A-1], and a third sauce that I liked but can't remember anything about); bananas Foster ice cream pie that was good but not to die for.  A number of wines are available by the glass.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I came here for my 20th birthday just recently and I definitely recommend it.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The steak I ordered was so tender that it practically melted when I touched it with my knife.  And it tasted even better.  I ordered shrimp with it as well and the each piece of shrimp was the size of my fist.  They, too, were delicious.  I received a small dessert with chocolate gellatto and real whipped cream which was awesome.  The one small misstep was actually the funniest part of the night.  My dad was having a gin and tonic and when he requested our main waiter for another one but with more gin in the drink, the second drink arrived in an even smaller glass.  My dad just sat and stared at the tiny little glass as I sat across the table chuckling for the rest of the evening.  So, it looks like you might not want to criticize the bartender.  Other than the sensitive bartender, the evening went off without a hitch.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Vegas is one of the few places in the U.S. where dining inside a hotel is cool and worth the extra green. Boy, did Emeril hit all the right notes on this little gem. It's both romantic and fun, warm and cool, and definitely a little trendy.\n\nI ordered the Quayle- off the chart delicious. The three other people I was with also loved their food. The wait staff does that stealthy stalking... you know... where one second you're staring into down into an empty H2O glass and then the next- it's completely full. Overall a great experience.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had Dinner at Delmonico on 11-5-15.  Still the best Wedge Salad that I have ever had.  The rest was great and the service is outstanding!  You can't go wrong at Delmonico!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great food. Great service too if you're a high roller, no so much for the average diner like me.\n\nThe table next to ours had someone on staff stopping by to check on the every few minutes, chat them up, pour more wine, etc.\n\nOur table of six received very mechanical service. Food was dropped off, and no one bothered to ask how the food was or of any of us would like another drink (two of us sat with an empty glass from the middle of the meal onward).\n\nFine dining is about the overall experience, and Delmonico let me down with poor service.\n\nThis was my second visit. I tried to give then a second chance, but this visit only confirmed the poor service from my first.  I will not be going back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Five stars you ask? Yes I answer and don't ever doubt me again. \n\nFirst let me mention they have one of the best wine lists in Vegas due to the Delmonico in Miami closing down and sending 500+ wines to this one in Vegas. Sorry that your other restaurant closed, Emeril, but thanks for the amazing wine.\n\nFor appetizers we had a sampler plate that consisted of BBQ shrimp, cold crab legs, and truffle oil potato chips. All three were great but the truffle oil potato chips were freaking amazing! These were the first chips I have had in years and I am so glad I chose these to break my no chip policy. \n\nFor main I went with the filet mignon very rare and it was delicious with the perfect amount of dry rub and no sauce, just the way I like it. Their sides are served family style and I love that. We had the wild mushrooms, creamed corn, asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes. \n\nOur dinner lasted three hours thanks to the amazing wine and they never once rushed us to leave. In fact, every time I came back to the table from the restroom (remember lots of wine) they had refolded my dinner napkin. Now that's some damn good service right there! \n\nThe ambiance is classy with all white walls, rounded ceilings and an open layout. Cheers
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had a wonderful dinner here with my husband and friends for his birthday. All of our food was excellent, well prepared. There only reason for 4 stars is the service was a bit too slow and inconsistent. I.E. our drink order was taken at 3 different times so we all received our drinks at different times. All in all, great food, ok service.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is part of my steak house reviews for Las Vegas. Delmonico's is a premier steak place. The staff is top notch and make you feel at home even though it is a high end steak joint. We were there for a bachelor party.  all of us tried varieties of different cuts. The filet and ribeye were phenomenal. The side selection was not as good as some other steak places I've been too, however it was still good. The only drawback and it was a minor one, was we had a vegan with us. His chef's creation was substandard for a place this cutting edge.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We went to Delmonico's a few years ago (while I was undecided if I was an Emeril fan or not...turns out, I'm not).  Didn't care for our meal, but the one thing that stood out was the Banana Cream Pie.\n\nWhen we were back in Vegas we stopped by just for a slice of that pie. A few years later and its as good as I remembered. I'm picky about bananas, not a pie person, and still this pie is amazing.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Prior to our trip, a few of us wanted to do a steak dinner in Vegas and we agreed on Delmonicos. Delving into the menu so I had an idea in mind of what I would be ordering, I became intrigued immensely when I saw that it was under Emeril's.\n\nWe were fortunate to be seated a little early. The ambiance of course evokes an intimate and formal setting with the dim lighting. The decor was minimal and I felt there could have used some art pieces.\n\nLet me say the service was top-notch. Although it is what you'd expect from such an establishment, very few places achieve such high marks IMO.\nThe water glasses were never empty and it felt like we didn't really have a server but a rotation of different people that comprised the waitstaff. I counted at least 6 different people between taking our order, serving the appetizers, the main course, side dishes, wine, filling the waters and dessert. \n\nAppetizer: Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare: Superb. I liked how the cucumber salad complemented the tuna & salmon and came in a spiraled form. The wonton chips were crispy and a nice form used for stacking the tartare & salad on. The wasabi provided a nice bite and offered a different note with the tartare. \n\nMain Course: Ribeye (no-bone). Some say the meat tastes better on the bone. In this case I found the Ribeye to be succulent, juicy well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Frankly I don't think it would have made much of difference if it was on the bone or not based on the flavor. Adding on the butter on top was a nice feature to the steak. \n\nSides: All the sides were delicious and was about the right amount to share for 3 (4 if the people aren't big eaters. \n\nPotato Gratin: So good I couldn't stop eating it. \n\nCreamed Spinach: No joke and the right balance of cream to tone down the strong taste of spinach was harmonic. \n\nAsparagus: I'm not an asparagus fan but if asparagus always tasted this good, it might crack my top 3 favorite vegetables. Had the right amount of salt and seasoning to create a more palatable asparagus. \n\nDessert: Sorbet; 3 scoops, 3 flavors. Strawberry, Banana and the 3rd resembled Coconut. I found the sorbet to be a more suitable and lighter offering vs. if it was an ice cream or gelato.\nClean flavors and the banana was surprisingly interesting given the fact its not something one often comes across.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	On my usual quest for the best Ribeye in America I wandered into Delmonicos Steakhouse in the Venetian. This place was magnificent! It did have  bland all white decor in the main dining that reminded me of 2001 a Space Odyssey 's Discovery One with  really dim lights. Good thing the steaks were from another universe also! It had to have been the largest ribeye I have ever ordered for one person, and It came with a slab of butter!  Really it needs more butter? It was well marbled, thick with a little char (key !),  and it had a wonderful juicy flavor. It  was extremely good as I was so full about 3/4 of the way through, but as in "man vs food" i trudged on ! I have to say it was a fantastic to eat, but i did feel like a hundred pounds heavier throughout the evening! Try the steak.... try the bone in Ribeye steak.... did I mention you should try the steak?  then next time maybe have something else..... if you dare!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	One of my top 5 Steak house favorites in Las Vegas. The service is always great and the steaks are even better. I recommend getting the Rib Eye bone in if you can handle the incredible flavor of a Juicy aged steak. I like the steak so much I won't stop eating it until it's all gone. \n\nSave room for dessert or you'll miss out on something wonderful.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I wanted my 300 review to be special and this restaurant sure is special.\n\nI have been  fortunate to dine at Delmonico's Steakhouse over a half of dozen times. I have never been disappointed. \nLast weekend for the second time in my life was lucky enough to have the Chef's Table that over looks the kitchen. As with the last time I ate in the Chef's Table it rates as the top 5 meals I have ever had in my life.\nYou don't order at the chef's table you enjoy each course that chef personally prepares for you.  Each course is better then  the previous.\nSome of my favorite dishes in the dining room are:\nSteak Tartare-very tasty served with toasted baguette.\nEmeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp, an original menu item, that is so delicious.\nMy favorite steak is the Bone in Rib Eye, a great piece meat that is aged in house.\nThe service at Delmonico is second to none, what  they are noted for is that everybody at the table get there plate at the same time, a real nice touch.\nGreat side dishes,creamed corn and twice cooked potatoes are my favorite.\nService is always top notch.\nA can't miss\nI will be back soon.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The only thing that would make dining at Delmonico's any better would be if Emeril Lagasse himself were sitting at your table.  On second thought, it might get awkward it he started yelling "BAM" every time I took a bite of food.\n\nDelmonico's has always been one of my favorite spots in Vegas.  I eat here anytime I'm in the city.  The service is always top notch and the food has consistently been delicious.  You really can't go too wrong with their menu.  The waitstaff assigned to your table are very helpful when you ask about the various dishes.\n\nI typically go with steak when I eat here.  They have always been cooked to perfection.  On my last visit, I had the grilled filet mignon medallions served with the mushroom crust, bacon and cheese.  I'm also a fan of the filet mignon served oscar style as well.  Both excellent.  Sides are great too.  Twice baked potato, mmmmmmmmm!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	When I was looking for a place for dinner for my birthday celebration weekend, this place wasn't really high on my list. When it comes to purses, shoes and sometimes clothes, I'll put down a pretty penny or hundred for nice stuff. But when it comes to food, I think to myself, "Is it really worth the cost to put something in only to have it come out?" \n\nIn this case, "Yes!" Okay... Sort of... \n\nI ordered the boneless Ribeye and a side of broccoli. Ribeye was good - just enough flavor and not too salty. Being the carnivore that I am, I was shocked that I really enjoyed the broccoli too. It was as perfect as steamed vegetables could get. It was bright green from top to bottom and crispy, not mushy. \n\nMy sister had pasta with shrimp. I must say, though there was shrimp on her plate, they were not "shrimp" at all! They were huge!! Seriously, Delmonico must get their produce, seafood and meat from "Food Heaven R Us" or something. \n\nAlthough the food was good, I would say the service is what gives Delmonico 4-stars. Again, I'm not a frequent fine diner. So, to have my water glass filled up every time it gets low to having another (delicious) roll magically appear on my plate just as I suck in the last mouthful is fantastic! I'd even go so far as to say they'd probably spray the air around me with something fragrant once the broccoli hit you know where. \n\nNow I can see why it's worth it to pay at least $50 for dinner. Thanks Emeril!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This was the best steak dinner I have had in Vegas hands down.  The portions are HUGE so you will leave very full.  The caprese salad was really good and the steak was amazing.  I was not so impressed with their dessert menu.  I would definitely come back.  My only complaint was that a meal takes a while at this place so be prepared for a leisurely dinner here.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Enjoyed the meal. $50 for a filet mignon. Cooked to perfection. The creamed spinach ($9)  might be the best I ever had. A nice flavor. Sort of had a hint of wood burned flavor added to it. The bread that was served with it was like a Yorkshire pudding that had a slight wood burned taste...excellent. The coffee was less than average. The service was excellent.  (Only odd thing...when the crumbs were cleaned off the table while I was between a course, they were not cleaned to a plate, but the empty chair).
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	With all the great restaurants already in Vegas and new ones opening up all the time, this is still my go to spot.  The combination of the great food (meat and seafood) as well as the excellent wine selection (thanks Kevin) makes this a dining experience to die for.  You haven't experienced fine dining in Vegas until you've been here.\n\nI personally enjoy the jumbo lump crab cakes and bone in Rib Eye steak prepared the chef's way.  Round out your entree with any of these delicious sides Twice baked potatoes with bacon, asparagus, creamed corn, and creamed spinach.\n\nI'm an adventurous eater and am always open to trying new wine pairings so I just ask for Kevin Vogt (Master Sommelier) for recommendations based on our food order.  You will never be disappointed.  Kevin is a wealth of knowledge and will introduce you to wines that you may not have heard of or tried before.  The great thing is that these wine selections are of great value. \n\nFor large parties, definitely call ahead and secure a reservation.  Parties of 4 or less should have no problems getting a table with a minimal wait.  If you're impatient or hungry, you should book a reservation just in case there's a convention in town.  This place gets busy!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went for dinner with my wife.   It was outstanding as always. \n\nI had the spinach salad which was fantastic and they tweaked it to accommodate my need to be dairy free.\n\nHad the salmon and mushrooms as a side.  Both were incredible. Some of the best I have had.\n\nServers were great and speedy.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My wife took me here for a fabulous dinner before the Blue Man Group show.  We got there in plenty of time and explained that we wanted to sit and enjoy our experience and planned on being there for awhile.  We were told that it was no problem and they were happy to have us as long as we like.  We were never once rushed or pushed out like at a lot of places just trying to turn tables even though we were there 2-3 hours.  The service was amazing but not to the point where you were harrassed...our drinks were never empty and plates never sat long but it seems we never noticed the waiter coming and going which is awesome.  We took our time with drinks, appetizers, and dinner and all were timed perfectly and served when we were ready.  The food was amazing as well!  I had the escargot and the bone-in ribeye which was the best steak I have ever had!  I have had a lot of steaks from so called steakhouses and top recommended restaurants, this is definitely tops!  My wife had the lobster bisque and king crab legs which were also absolutely delicious.  The prices are higher, but it goes directly with the service and quality of food and I have no problem paying for what we got.  We will definitely go back...now if we could only catch Emeril there!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This restaurant is amazing! We started with the BBQ Shrimp & Oysters. Then my husband got the Shrimp & Grits. \n\nBut what satisfied me (and had flavors that I will continue to search for) was the Pappardelle Pasta with Wild Mushrooms. It had (and I quote from the menu) Fresh White Italian Truffles, Parmesan Reggiano, Vermont Butter and Local Chives. I can't wait to come back just to get this, but it was a special, so hopefully they will have it!\n\nThe staff was great too. Very helpful and not stuffy at all. I told our waiter I was craving pasta (which is limited on their menu) and he said they could make me a shrimp scampi on the fly.\n\nAnd I thought their digital wine list was so cool!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Located on Restaurant Row in the Venetian is Delmonico's Steakhouse. This place is nice, very nice. The lounge area was spacious, plentiful amount of seating, with a bar area. Not a bad place to hang out if there is a wait for your table. You are not able to see inside the restaurant from the lounge area. \n\nWe had a table of 13 and we were separated into 2 tables. The seats were very very comfortable. I believe they do accommodate large parties all in one table, but I guess for that time slot on that day, this was our only choice. Reservations are highly recommended here and book in advance if you have a large party. \n\nOur waiter or host shall I call him was very informative about just about everything! He recommended what was the best things on the menu, where to party after dinner, what wines were great, along with how I should get my steak cooked! He was simply awesome. \n\nI order the BONE IN RIB STEAK which is also originally what the server recommended. The price for a good steak does not come cheap, this one was worth all $52.00. Medium rare was perfect. The steak is huge it almost took up the whole entire plate, tender, moist, juicy, perfect temperature, minimal fat, butter came on top of the steak like a pancake, very easy to cut, bone was just this big straight across:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nso it was very easy to get every last piece off the bone. \n\nI strongly suggest you order the steak with a nice red wine. Your taste buds will be in heaven. \n\nThe sides are a bit deceiving if you look at the pictures of the sides. For some reason I was expecting a huge pot, but dont let the pictures fool you! The side order of sauteed mushrooms was very delicious. I put that to the side because I did not want to share with anyone. The truffle potato chips was very greasy, save your $10 and order another side instead. \n\nThe calamari was okay. Not worth the $14. Marinara sauce came on top of the calamari already, so if you did not eat it fast enough, it could get soggy real quickly. \n\nTHEY HAVE THE BEST WARM BREAD HERE EVER! TEST YOURSELF AND SEE IF YOU CAN RESIST JUST ONE! \n\nI can finally say I ate at one of Emeril's restaurants! Seeing you on the Food Network making all those different mouth watering dishes is for real! Definitely a must try if you are a steak lover.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The service was great. The appetizer bread was stale. The lunchtime burger was good but definitely overpriced, much better burgers at umami burger. The lobster sliders were decent.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delicious gumbo, chateaubriand, asparagus, and the most amazing mashed potatoes!  I thought the chateaubriand was a good value at $105 for two people, as it came with sides and was cooked to order at our table.  The wine was good, the service was great, all of the staff was friendly.  I think my favorite part was the warm dinner rolls.  I loved their wine list too.  I will definitely eat here next time I'm staying at the Venetian.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The first time I was here, the steak was great.  We came back today, and the steak was a bit overcooked thought it was still real good.  The garlic mushroom side order is a must.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico is the definition of fine dining.  Delicious food and excellent service.  It was like the serving staff were magicians.  Always there when you needed them, and even when you didn't know you needed them.  \n\nFood was delicious - steaks perfectly cooked. \n\nDecor was minimal but classy.  Music was quiet, and the whole setting was very serene.  \n\nDefinitely would recommend this!  Thank you Delmonico for a wonderful anniversary dinner!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had dinner here last week - great food, very nice atmosphere.  Top notch steakhouse.\n\nThe bone in ribeye was delicious, as you would expect there was a lot of fat on it but the flavor was worth it.  \n\nThe bone in filet (a special) was very good, tender, less fat than the rib eye but also less flavor.  \n\nI would say both are worth getting but it depends on your preference for flavor vs. tenderness.  \n\nThe duck was very good - not fatty as most duck is but still full of flavor - if you are looking for a non steak entre I think this is the way to go.\n\nI didn't have one so I cannot confirm but someone I was dining with said the mojito was the best they have ever had so keep that in mind if you are a mojito fan.\n\nOverall a great dinner.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AWESOME!!! Best steak I have EVER had. This is not a chain restaurant, the prices are significant, but the food and service are well worth it in my opinion. I love steak and have tried a variety of great steakhouses in amazing cities, but none can compare to Delmonico's. My wife is generally not impressed by food, she sees it more of necessity that something to be enjoyed, but she continues to rave about Delmonico's. Whenever I'm in Vegas, I will definitely dine at Delmonico's.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The food was good.  The service lacked personal service.  There was nothing superior about the food.  Good food nothing extra special or amazing for the price.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great steak house. The spinach salad with bacon and a fried egg is to die for. I always get the fillet and French fries. The fries are not in the menu but are AMAZING. All in all one of my favorite steak houses in Vegas. A must try.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Don't get me wrong by the lack of a fifth star, I really, really loved dining at Delmonico's.  I thought the service was extremely attentive (truly some of the best service I have had) and food was great.  I would definitely return and I am sure we would have another wonderful dining experience.  However, I have had better steaks so I cannot rank this as the best of the best.  On the other hand, this is one of the best restaurants I have been to in Vegas and would definitely give it two thumbs up and recommend it to those staying at the Venetian.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I'll make this one an easy read. \n\nI have been to this steakhouse 4 times since it has opened. The 1st time being within it's 1st month, the last several weeks ago.\n\nMy 1st 2 visits were awesome, great steaks and sides and good service, then something happened on my 3rd trip about 1 1/2 years ago, the food was just o.k. not horrible but nothing that great. Well a few weeks ago we were back at the Venetian.  I was there with my Wife, 2 sons(16 and 5) and my Sister in Law, everyone wanted steak, so we decided why not let's try Delmonico's.\n\nTurns out this was a bad choice and one that will keep me from going back, with all the new crops of good steakhouses(many within the same hallway) that have popped up since this place has opened, Delmonico's needs to get it's act together.\n\nWe ordered 3 Rib Eyes, 1 Filet, and my 5 year old got a burger. For sides truffled potato chips, mashed potatoes and corn.\n\nWhen we were sat, we immediately were served water and our drink orders taken, that was the highlight of the meal. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and orders taken. When we asked if they had anything specific for our 5 year old, they suggested the burger, fine he can have that, if not my Wife would have just split some of her filet with him\n\nWhen our food came about 50 minutes later, mind you the place had just opened and there were no more than 4 other tables occupied. They put all our food down in front of us and they then proceeded to give my son a burger that had to have been at least 12 ounces, we all looked at each other and then commented on how and why would they serve him that.  Mind you, waiter suggested this burger for the 5 yr old.\n\nBack to the other plates, it was just large chunks of flavorless meat, the sides were bland and the truffled chips were soaking in oil. When it was all over and done we had been there almost 2 hours and were out almost $300. I have no problem spending good money for a good meal, but this meal left us feeling like we had wasted our time and our money.\n\nWill not go back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had dinner on 6/26/13. This was the second time my wife and I dined at Delmonico Steakhouse. The 1st time I ordered the bone-in-ribeye and was disappointed because it had some gristle and was underwhelming to say the least. On this trip, the wife had the organic baby mixed greens salad and the Filet while I had the shrimp cocktail and once again the bone-in-ribeye. We also shared an order of asparagus.\n\nThe Filet was good - tender and nicely seasoned. My ribeye was disappointing, however. It was not very tender and didn't have much flavor for being dry-aged 2-3 weeks as per our waiter.\n\nThe service and atmosphere are on par with most of the other high-end steakhouses in Vegas, but the steaks are not as good as those we have had at Craftsteak, Cut, N9ne, Stripsteak, Prime, or even STK. Does not deserve more than 3 stars IMO and even though it wasn't bad, it is not good enough for us to return especially with all the other choices in town.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	For a steak place in Vegas .. 5 stars, and this is simply why.\n\n\nSteak, $52 Bone in ribeye, one of the best 20 oz steaks I've ever had\nService, waiters were always very helpful\nDrinks and apps, good flavor and well and fair portions.\n\nAll in all, i expected to be hungry after and go to like a smaller and quicker place after just to make sure i was full, but i was so satisfied i was sleepy.   Also, i went in at 8:30 for my meal and for a table of 4 i think we left like close to 11. It wasn't that the service was slow, the atmosphere and ambiance was just right to forget time and enjoy your meal and the people your with.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I have been to many steak places in Vegas and had always wanted to go, but it can be hard to get a reservation. This time we planned way in advance so we could eat at a reasonable time. \n\nThe food: The food was reasonable but slightly over priced. The steak that I had was good and cooked to how I ordered it, but for $52.00, it could have been better. Since it was served a la carte, I ordered a baked potato, $8.00.  I would suggest the pecan pie for dessert, best I have ever had.\n\nThe service: Some of the best service I have every see before. Everything was excellent from the moment our server arrived at our table to the moment we left. Very professional but not to stuffy. All of his suggestions were right on.\n\nI am not sure I would go again, since there are so many places to choose from, but I would suggest it to my friends.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I am a huge fan of Emeril's recipes and have made many of his dishes with great results, however I've never been impressed with any of Emeril's restaurants and this wasn't an exception....  The food is great but I expect something more spectacular at Emeril's restaurant.  Maybe I need to try a steak here next time.  It is a great lunch stop when you are looking for a place with no wait.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I chose this place for my birthday and it ended up to be the perfect choice. \nService and ambiance were marvelous and I was really happy! \n\nThis is what we ordered: \nJumbo Lump Crab Cake: all crab meat with hardly any filler. AMAZING \n\nLobster Bisque: Not a bisque person but it was so delicious here. yummy!!! \n\nWhite cheddar & bacon grits: creamy and cheesy, oh so good! \n\nWild sauteed mushrooms: Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Pair with steak very well.\n\nBone in rib eye: Nice big piece of steak with a bit of fat, which is the way I like my steak. \n\nChateaubriand: 2 big pieces of fillet Mignon that also comes with a side of steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes finished at table side for two people. Fillet was SO tender and juicy, probably one of the best I've had! Not an asparagus person so it was bleh. Mashed potatoes were ok. \n\nI would love to go back again with my boyfriend and have a romantic dinner.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I ordered the filet mignon, not the best I had. Cooked right but not as tender. The sides were much better. We had the creamed corn and potatoes au gratin, my favorite. We ordered some kind of butter cake for dessert. No one at our table liked it. One of the servers overheard us talking about the cake and the waiter immediately came and took it off the tab. They do have great service and the decor is nice but with so many great restaurants in the city, I don't need to go back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Came here for a bachelor party. The day of (busy Saturday) I made a reservation for 20 and they accommodated us with a smile. We even got two tables of 10 next to each other! Excellent service! The food was good but did not stand out from most of the other vegas steakhouses or normal steakhouses in general. I would recommend just based on service we received.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Decadent.  Delicious.  Delightful.  \n\nThat was our experience, celebrating our 3-year Wedding Anniversary at Delmonico's! \n\n#Bone-In Ribeye ~ a must ($52).  Tender, seasoned and delicious.  Perfectly cooked medium rare.  We added the foie gras accompaniment ($20), which made it INCREDIBLE.  Killer combo and highly recommended!\n\n#Corn Au Gratin ~ piping hot, with crunchy bread crumbs on top.  Not too heavy, not too light.  A definite winner.  I could not stop eating it.\n\n#Creamed Spinach ~ good.  Also not too heavy.  But, not mind blowing.  \n\n#Wild Mushroom Pappardelle Pasta with Truffle ~ a decadent appetizer and quite delicious.  ($20)  This was a dinner special, so I don't know if they regularly have it.  Tasty, but quite a small proportion.\n\n#Lobster Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette ~ tasty, with a nice chunk of lobster on the side of leafy greens, thinly sliced red onions and halved cherry tomatoes.  ($20) But, nothing to write home about.  \n\n#Bread ~ Biscuit shaped croissants, with butter.  Ok.  Would have been better served warm.  \n\nService was attentive.  Our champagne glasses were topped off regularly.  Water glasses refilled constantly.  Reservations were a piece of cake through OpenTable.  Seated within 5 minutes of arrival.  Total bill - $200+ for 2 people.  Reasonably priced for fine dining.  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  Highly recommend and would dine again!  Next time, I will leave room for dessert.  Creme Brulee and Bread Pudding was on the menu and I heart both!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I am in love. In love with the ceasar salad prepared at our table by our very likable  waiter, in love with the steak medallions topped with lobster and drizzled with a wonderful bearnaise sauce... in fact I would be hard pressed to find anything to criticize about the experience we had here last week. Finally, the banana cream pie was nothing short of the totally perfect end to our evening. Fine wine, fine company, fine service and more than fine food. Dare I say it one more time??? In LOVE haha
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We had the worst service there. The bread never came until we asked and when we got it, it was cold. The only way the bread can be cold on  a very busy night was the left over from other tables. \nThe food was good except the Thanksgiving turkey meal was bad! Tasteless, not good at all!!\nThe whole time the server barely came over to check on us and we had to flag him down after so many times of him passing but not looking at us. \nWill not recommend and never go back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is one of Chef Emeril Lagasse's brilliant work. Great upscale yet modern American steak house serving Prime American beef along with Piedmontese and Wagyu steaks, Kurobuta pork, lobster and seafood tower, and Foie Gras. Great environment, amazing food, superb service and to go with excellent collection of wine. My wife and I are regular here and we always invite our friends and business contacts to dinner we never had a bad meal or service. Just try to make a reservation because they get fully booked.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Let's be honest: steakhouses are a dime-a-dozen in Las Vegas. Every which way you look, there's some place that's being advertised as "The Best Steakhouse in Nevada!" or "THE Las Vegas Steakhouse" or "If Elvis Were Alive, He Would Eat Here!"\n\nNot all steakhouses are created equal -- Delmonico is proof of that.\n\nSituated in between the Palazzo and the Venetian, Delmonico is unassuming from the outside. It looks simple and classy. Once you step inside, however, you realize that comfort is their highest priority. The chairs are deep and made of the most comfortable leather. You won't want to get up when you're finished with your meal. \n\nThis was our second visit (our first for lunch), and I must say that the service was just as attentive and cordial as they had been the first time. Both of our servers were named Peter (which turned out to be quite humorous when we called out for one and they both came running), and they were extremely pleasant. They had absolutely no problem recommending dishes or letting us know their personal favorites. \n\nFor my appetizer, I had the heirloom tomato salad. The tomatoes were ripe, juicy, and delicious. The accompanying cheese was a perfect pair to offset the acidity of the tomatoes. Thin slivers of onions covered the perimeter of the plate, which were also very nice.\n\nI chose the fillet of beef medallions for my entree, and I was impressed with how absolutely wonderful they were. About a half-dollar in diameter and an inch tall, they were perfectly cooked, not to mention topped in Parmesan cheese and drizzled with homemade Worcestershire sauce. \n\nDelmonico doesn't need to be one of those places that wears people out with advertising. They know how good they are, and they aren't afraid to knock your socks off. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a relaxing way to enjoy an evening with good people and great food.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Yummy!  I didn't realize this was an Emeril (the "BAM!!!" guy on the Food Network) restaurant until I looked at the menu.  Cherylynn N. made reservations for a friend's 30th birthday dinner celebration.  Our reservations were at 7pm, but part of our party got lost so we were seated around 7:15-7:30pm.  \n\nAMBIANCE:\nWell lit, but dim which created a "romantic" setting for those looking for a date night.  As we had 9 people in our party, we were set up in the middle in umm...an oddly shaped table (see Cherylynn N's description).  The restaurant was packed, but the noise level wasn't too loud.\n\nSERVICE:\nGREAT service!  The waitress was very attentive.  When the food was brought out, there were 5 servers which each carried our entrees in each hand and simultaneously placed them in front of each of us at once.  It was truly a sight to see.\n\nFOOD:\n**Note: Most dishes are ala carte, so you'll probably want to order sides.  Sides are big enough for 2-3 people to share**\n\n-Crab Bisque ($12) - Delicious, creamy, and full of yummy flavor!!  This was on the Chef's special list, therefore I am not sure if they have this on a regular basis.  The bisque soup is the same as the lobster bisque, but instead of lobster pieces, its generous portions of crab.\n\n-Jumbo Lobster Tail ($48/Market Price) - As I am not such a big meat eater, a lobster tail was my alternative.  I didn't expect such a generous sized portion to come out.  It was heaven!!  Delicious!!  Tender!! \n\n-Creamed Spinach Side ($9) - It was good, but didn't have the additional pieces of bacon that most restaurants have.  You could definitely tell the spinach was fresh though.  \n\n-Creamed Corn Side ($9) - YUMMMMMMM!!  I must come back especially for this side!! The corn was so sweet with a light crust on top.  Words cannot describe how yummy this side was, definitely a must try!!\n\nSo I know this is a steakhouse with steak, of course, being their specialty.  My friend insisted that I try some of his rib eye.  I'm not a meat person, but I will admit that it was tender and full of flavor.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	With all due respect to other Steak places in Vegas, Delmonico knocks it out of the park! The bone in ribeye (Delmonico), cream corn, cream spinach, potatoes gratin, even the mixed greens salad were fantastic! The banana cream pie and even the quality of coffee were above par. Our waiter Michael and his co-staff were great. We have a now a total of three great experiences at Delmonico. Is it expensive, well isn't everything in Vegas? It is a must every time we're in Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had dinner at Delmonico a few days ago and a few things surprised me. I felt like I was sitting in a ball room rather than a restaurant and although we ordered a bottle of white wine and a bottle of red wine, both bottles were opened in front of us without offering us to taste before pouring the glasses.  Lobster Bisque was amazing.   Actual dinners were ok.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Want a true VIP experience? Try the chef's table here. We had the greatest experience here for my birthday. Chef came to the table and explained each course he had specially prepared for us.\nWe brought our own wine and champagne but I believe you can order it there as well.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, bar none. You can always count on Emeril Lagasse to deliver on his good name. We were in town for my fiance's birthday, so I jumped at the chance to make a reservation at Delmonico. \n\nWe arrived about 20 mins early for our reservation. We took a seat in the lounge and waited for about 3 minutes before they came and got us to be seated. Not enough time to rate the cocktail service. \n\nI started with the lobster bisque. Creamy, hot, and with chunks of tender lobster aplenty. So flavorful, I chose to pass on the offer of fresh ground pepper. An A+ app. \n\nOn to main course. I had the boneless rib eye steak. I LOVED that the waiter asked me to cut into it in front of him to be sure it was prepared to my liking, and it was perfect! Upon the first bite, time stood still. I could think of nothing but how delicious the bite in my mouth was, and how I could not wait to demolish the easily 12oz. piece of heaven in front of me. The meat had a juiciness and flavor that even the most discerning of carnivore would have to admit was the best ever. \n\nThe fiancee had the Grilled Filet Medallions, wild mushroom crusted with Emeril's Worcestershire sauce, house cured bacon, and Parmesan cheese. I, of course, had to have a taste of these fantastic looking medallions, and they were stellar. I especially liked the play between the slightly sweet of the Worcestershire and the savory of the meat and Parmesan crust. Also an awesome dish. \n\nDue to the healthy portions, there was no room for dessert. We were given a sorbet on the house that was very tangy, a raspberry I believe... \n\nThe service was top notch, everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. All my expectations were met, and I highly recommend stopping in for the steak of a lifetime!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I was disappointed.  I enjoy my steaks and enjoy most steakhouses.  My colleague talked me into going here and it was overpriced and not great.\n\nI think your typical chain high-quality steakhouse is better than this place and actually cheaper.  Not that the price matters that much - you just notice when it is premium pricing and sub-par food.\n\nI had the bone-in ribeye and it was enormous but wasn't really special.\n\nWould not bother going again - I will rather try somewhere else.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Food was excellent!!!!  The favorites of our group were lobster, ribeye, filet, rack of lamb.  Salmon was a bit dry and halibut was just ok, but fine.  My personal standout for the many sides we got was the potatoes au gratin...I'm still dreaming!!!  Our service was just ok until the end when our server scolded someone in our group and said "sssshhhhh."   Really???  If he was ruining something for other customers (which I'm sure he wasn't--others tables were toasting with us) than a manager should've come up and said something, not her.  I mentioned to the hostess we were a lively group and to sit us accordingly.  She assured me it was not a problem.  We spent a lot of money and ended on a sour note--which is no bueno....it could've been handled so much better.  Also, they knew we were celebrating an anniversary and didn't bring a complimentary dessert??? (I think even Cheesecake Factory does that?).  It just seemed the waitress had a personality problem and didn't like us from the get go. Unfortunately, this is the second visit here where the service has fallen short.  Four stars for food.  Not in a hurry to go back.  There's no "sssshhhhh-ing in Vegas!"
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	About 2 years ago, I had dreamed of eating steak at Delmonico's.  The reputation of this place exceeds my expectations; and, as such, is my dilemma with this place.  Delmonico's is Emeril lagasse's steak house.  It is his prime choice, so-to-speak, and it has one of the prime locations between the Palazzo and the Venetian, right in front of the Blue Man Group entrance, across from V-bar, B&B, and next door to Aquaknox.  I've walked by this place numerous times and always wanted to eat there.  Suffice to say, in the past two years, I have.  In short, I have eaten at Delmonico's 6 times.  Not bad for someone that gives this place 3-stars.  \n\nPros: \nWine list is expansive and can be very intimidating.  However, I question the knowledge of one of the staff when they recommended a pinot for our bone-in ribeye.  I know a little bit about wine, well, who I am I kidding, I pretend to know a lot.  Enough to the point that I didn't think I'd want a pinot.  However, it was his recommendation and I thought I would go with it.  It was definitely a pinot.  Very disappointed since the body of it didn't fit right with our bone-in ribeye (which was my concern to begin with).\nThe steak is choice (to steal my favorite John Hughes film).\nCan sit large groups fairly easily.\nWill sit a table fairly late (almost 11pm on a Friday night).\nExcellent sides.\nThey are fairly attentive with the service.\nThe scotch list is reasonable.  However, I do usually get a vodka martini with blue cheese stuffed olives (and they hit it pretty good).  \nThey do have a chef's table near the kitchen.  For a heavy trafficked weekend, I believe you have to book well into 3-months in advance (numbers change based on availability).  I am interested in trying this because I think it would be a blast to have a bunch of friends, drinking out of a magnum, and eating some good steak (but I'm not that organized nor do I have an event to do that with).  Well, who am I kidding, I don't even have that many friends.  Ha!  Anyways...\n\n\nCons: \nI always get the bone-in ribeye and each time I've eaten it, the seasoning (which I believe is a cajun based creole seasoning) is slightly different each time.  In some cases the seasoning can be too much and in others, its not enough.  There just isn't any consistency.\nAll but one time I've eaten here someone has gotten the ribeye too rare or too well-done.  The fact that they can't get this right concerns me.  You are a steakhouse; get it right; its what you are supposed to be good at!\nThe decor is more monastery like.  \n\nThe first time I ate here, I gave it 4-stars (my meal was great, my girlfriends meal wasn't cooked right).  If they clean up their act and make things tight and organized, I think Delmonico's is a 4-star steakhouse.  The steak is pretty tasty.  Its perfectly okay to pick up the bone and start gnawin on it.  Well, within reason of course.  However, it has too much inconsistency between day to day operations and meals.  To be fair, I'd still come and eat here (cause I believe the steak is an excellent quality of meat) but with the competition being so tight in Vegas, I've started to venture out.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Took my fiancé here for our 5 year anniversary since he is such a fan of steak.  To be honest, I always felt that if you've been to one steakhouse, you've been to them all.  But that doesn't mean the food was any less delicious.  \n\nThe truffle chips were crunchy and packed with flavor and the salmon tartare was delicious!  We also ordered the bone in filet, which was a little on the salty side but the meat was perfectly tender...but what I was extremely excited about was the foie gras (banned in California).  The order of foie gras was plentiful and just heaven paired with the steak.  \n\nThe service was impeccable, I never once felt forgotten.\n\nSigh, I guess I'll need to take that 4 hour drive everytime I'm craving foie gras.....
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We originally booked reservations at another restaurant. Then we decided to go to the Diana Ross show so decided to go to Delmonico so we wouldn't have to rush after the show. What a great choice. We had the fries oysters and I could've had three orders. They were perfectly prepared and so savory! We were served several piping hot pop over rolls with rosemary baked into them. They literally melt in your mouth. It was late and we weren't super hungry so we decided to try several small plates.  We split the salmon. The salmon was perfect. A bit spicy, a bit sweet with potato hash and andoulle sausage. We also had the creamed spinach, BBQ shrimp and the grits. I didn't love the grits but everything else was awesome. They have a full selection of bourbons (an entire book) which made my bf very happy. I had a really crisp Rose' .. it was really good. The staff works as a team to make sure no needs go unmet. Nicole was so engaging and accommodating. We will go back next time we are in town.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The steak here was just ok. Granted I was h h h h hammered.  But I have a distinct fuzzy memory of it being unmemorable.  Really wish I had gone to Carne Vino or Cut instead.  But this place is easier at accommodating a massively sized group without a fixed menu.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I celebrated Christmas here with my family in 2014. My grandfather had cancer and wanted an authentic caesar salad since his appetite was back and he felt better. The service was  outstanding and so was the food. My sister and I had to split a T-bone steak because it was so big. We devoured it in about 3 minutes because it just melted. It was seasoned perfectly and the side orders we picked came in generous portions (we had to take them home).  My grandfather loved the salad he kept saying it was exactly what he was craving. It was the first time I'd eaten a correctly made caesar and it was extremely well flavored. Everyone was so stuffed and we had tons of food left over. As I stated before the service was outstanding I day this because my grandfather started feeling pain and needed to be taken home to have his medication immediately. They let half of us leave to escort him to our ride and we hadn't even paid or bill. They discreetly packed up or food and took our payment after they were sure his situation was handled, they even offered to have security bring a wheel chair and escort us out the Venetian. That was the last Christmas meal I will ever share with him because he recently passed away but thanks to the understanding, kindness, and professionalism of the staff I will forever have a beautiful memory.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Atmosphere is very conservative.  Service was great, however steaks are okay not OUTSTANDING like at Prime at Bellagio.  The sides were excellent.  The wine menu is over 100 pages.  But really not work the $52 for a bone in ribeye
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Another great steakhouse in Las Vegas (I think almost all of them are great, and it all depends on what style you are looking for). This is a chain restaurant so some might be skeptical, but overall I think this is one of the better restaurants of the chain (as I have been to several of the Delmonico restaurants). The service was great as usual and for the price point of the steak, I think one of the more affordable steakhouses in Las Vegas for what you get. \n\nThe bone-in rib eye - cooked to perfect medium rare and the one thing that Delmonico's adds to their steaks is a big chunk of herb butter that just adds so much more flavor to the steak (although you know its bad for you, you just want more!). \n\nSides - great for sharing and we had the mixed mushrooms, creamed spinach and creamed corn. Not the best sides that I've had, but they were good.\n\nOverall, a great option for a steakhouse in The Venetian and in Las Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Simply put; The finest Steakhouse in the country.  The food is always mind-blowing and the service is exceptional.  Bring your wallet cause you pay for the BEST.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My wife and I were very excited to visit the restaurant, however, although the service was superb, the overall taste and quality of the meal was lacking and something to be desired. The "feel" and atmosphere of the restaurant was dull and drab, with chairs lining the walls towards the restaurant which seems to be very far away from the main dining area, loud noises from kids with no supervision and an atmosphere that  just wasn't romantic and inviting. If I had to do it again I would go somewhere else,  as there are many other restaurants on The Strip where you can spend in excess of  $150 and get more value. The most impressive part of the meal was the attentive wait staff, they were extremely professional, courteous and attended to our every need.\n\nThe other Emeril's restaurant at the MGM Grand was superb, I'm not sure what is going on with Delmonico. Hopefully mgmt. will do more to make the experience more enjoyable. Hope this review helps.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I say 3.8 stars. \n\nIt's absolutely what I would expect going in. I didn't think it was anything really special about it. My steak was cooked perfectly and the sides we ordered (musrooms, mashed potatoes, and shoot I can'r remember is they were green beans or asparagus) were all tasty. \n\nIf you want a good old fancy steak dinner that's reasonably priced this place is not a bad place to go for it. \n\nOh! the service was fantastic.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Family and I went last night.  Everything was mediocre except my wife's filet.  Prices are crazy
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I had been to Delmonico when they first opened years ago and was so impressed. This time, I was definitely underwhelmed. First,we had a 5:00 reservation and there right when they opened. We had stated on our reservations that it was was our anniversary. We got no acknowledgement of it and were seated at the worst table in the restaurant in a corner with a cheap floor lamp that was covered in dust next to us. No one was even in the restaurant, so they could have given us a nice booth. It was still dead there at 6:30 when we left. On to the food. Popovers were just ok. Hubby's ribeye was yummy. My filet however, was dry as the Sahara and had no flavor. Not a speck of juice ran out when I cut into it. My hubby said it looked like jerky. So disappointed. Sides creamed spinach and twice baked potato were just ok. Twice baked was just a big greasy glob of cheese and wasn't even hot. For dessert, we got the banana cream pie. It was good but I was expecting it to wow me based on what others had said about it. Sadly, I don't think I'll be back. For the price, I'd rather have Mastros or Ruth's Chris.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Been here several times. This is definitely our go to place in Vegas. Awesome service! Steaks are the best I've had. We like to try different places but we always have to go to Delmonico while in Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is not my first time at Delmonico. I was in Vegas a few years ago on business (again) and had a group dinner (10-12 people) here. I did not make the reservation but the person who did somehow got us the chef's table. If you are not familar...the chef's table is it's own room separate but right next to the kitchen. Because the room is made up of clear glass...we could see right into the kitchen and watch our meals being made. It was very cool. We did the tasting menu. It was all great and the portions were so large that by round 4 I was uncomfortably full...and still had the steak course to go! \n\nI came back for dinner last week with some friends for dinner. No chef's table this time...sat in the regular ole dining area. Service was pretty good and I thought the food delivered (although my initial experience was a bit more memorable). We had the calamari with an live tapenade and also the BBQ shrimp. I thought the calamari was good, not spectacular (this would not have been my first choice as an app but I wasn't the only one at dinner). I thought the BBQ shrimp was delicious and had great flavor, cooked perfectly. Split a blue cheese wedge - can't go wrong there. I had the mixed grill special which came with a piece of pork tenderloin, slab of bacon & a piece of andouille sausage all served over greens and andouille grits. Delicous! The andouille sausage was the star of the plate as far as I'm concerned. My friend had a ribeye and a cheddar twice baked potato and enjoyed it. Someone else got the pork tenderloin off the regular menu which came with grits, greens & cornbread pancakes (which were tasty). All of us enjoyed our meals. I think it's a nice little "splurge" for dinner. \n\nI do agree with another reviewer who said that the ambience is nothign special (unless you get the chef's table of course) and that the steak selection was nothing different - same cuts of meat as other fine steak houses. I didn't see that "wow" factor onthe menu...which is why I ordered one of the specials.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Lets start with the fact that I pretty much have given up on fancy corporate owned pretentious restaurants years ago.  I prefer the owner operated versions where you can get top notch ingredients cooked expertly with love and care.  Isn't that what we really want when we dine out? In my case, yep. \n\nI have been to several of Emerils restaurants in NOLA as well as the one in the MGM, and this was one fine, and to my surprise, a very fun expierence as well. From the time we walked in we had a hilarious encounter with the hostess.  She informed us that it was an hour wait for the dining room.  We didnt want to wait that long so she offered us the option of sitting at the bar.  \n\nHmm, glanced over and observed a 60ish man and a bouffant haired woman sitting towards the end of the bar, a couple of empty seats to their left, but that was busy with a crowd of men milling about. I jokingly said to the hostess that was not a bad option, but that lady looked like the type that would be doused in perfume which would be a bit of a palate buzz kill. She stated that she was sensitive to that as she was allergic to perfume. I, again joking, suggested she stroll by and test the air. \n\nShe immediately walked towards the lady doing a perfect "whistle past the graveyard" stroll and raised her nose to the heavens as she passed the suspect. It was absolutely hilarous. Guess we couldnt leave after that, damn glad we stayed. \n\nThe other reviewers have already testified re; the awesome food, I definetly concur, but wanted to yelp about the personality of some of the staff. Oh, our bartendress/server was a joy as well.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Hey everyone - first yelp review. And what better way to kick it off than with the wonderful Delmonico Steakhouse in the Venetian Hotel and Casino. This is my first Emeril's experience and it was a good one. \n\nDisclaimer: A fraternity brother of mine is a manager here and insisted that my group try it! \n\nI was in town for a bachelor party and 8 of us dined here on a Friday night. We had a reservation for 8:30 and were seated promptly. The appetizers included delicious (albeit greasy) chips sprinkled with parmesan cheese and the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp with biscuit. The shrimp were easily the most tasty that I've ever had - my only complaint is that one order ($18 only included 3 shrimp). I wish I had 2 or even three. The biscuit was pointless for this entree (and barely noticeable), It actually went uneaten as our party was preoccupied with the wonderful hot butter rolls that they continued to bring around.\n\nFor my entree I had the filet mignon ($48) and it was absolutely fabulous. I order my steaks medium well to well, which could sometimes mean a loss of flavor if it's not done right. In this case, the steak was cooked perfectly and had a ton of flavor. This was easily the best steak I've ever had - and I'm a red meat fan. \n\nService was excellent, atmosphere was a bit gloomy (although aren't good steak houses supposed to be?) and I was simply too full to try dessert. The rest of the party thoroughly enjoyed their meal. The highlight of the evening may have been seeing Larry Flynt seated just a few feet away from us, enjoying his steak and eggs. Apparently he's a regular.\n\nIf you're in Vegas and looking for a sure-fire steakhouse, stop by Emeril's Delmonico. You WON'T be disappointed.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I stumbled into Delmonico Steakhouse after going to the wrong place as suggested by my friend. He told me to go to Emeril's in Vegas, so I did. However, the only place that houses Emeril's name is the Fish House.\n\nMy friend challenged me that Demonico had the best Caesar salad after I claimed I had found the holy grail. So I had to try it here. First off, they make it from scratch, tableside here. They even have you inspect it before putting salad in.\n\nPreviously I thought I had good Caesar salad, but this was on a different level. The salads that I've had before were either good or bad. The flavor was just that. however this salad actually had *waves* of flavor. you could distinctly taste the pepper fade in and out, the egg fade in and out, sardines fade in and out, and other flavors until it mellowed out on your palette. WTF, are you serious? I didn't even know salad dressing could do that. I give the salad a 5/5\n\nMy lady and I shared the lamb. I am not a huge lamb eater because I generally find it too fatty and I don't like fatty texture. This was good though and I did enjoy it all. It could have been a little more charred on the outside as I found that part to be the most tasty. I probably would have been better off with something a little more traditional like steak, I suppose. I'll give them lamb a 4/5\n\nFor dessert I got this cheesecake that was akin to a smore. It was seriously yum. I was stuffed before I started it, and I still ate it - it was that good. I will give it a 5/5.\n\nWhat was magnificent with this place was the service. I am very particular with service and how often the service visits your table. I was a little scared at first of this place when they announced that we would be attended by three different people. Of crap I thought, they are going to be down my throat every bite. But really, they worked it like a charm. They came when they needed to and didn't come when they didn't need to come - all three of them. My water was constantly full as well. I really appreciated this.\n\nI want to go back here next time I am in town and do a few things differently. First, don't eat 3 hours before arriving. I was not all that hungry when I arrived and I felt like I was doing myself a disservice. Second, try something more to my liking such as chicken or steak. I have to give it a 4.5 but yelp doesn't allow a half mark. I feel that the main part of the meal was the weakest which is the main reason you are there so I am rounding down to 4-stars. Maybe if I enjoyed the main course a little more (not that it was bad) then I would have given it a straight 5-stars.\n\nI'll be back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place was amazing, probably the best meal I have ever had in my life.  I came here with my boyfriend at the time, for an early dinner.  We arrived earlier than our reservation, so while we were waiting we were looking at the menu outside to see what we would have. \n\n I thought I had made my decision, but once inside we found out that the chef makes something special each day.  So of course this is what I decided on ordering, and so did he.  Which I was a little bummed because I was hoping he would order something different so we can share.  Our dish was served in a large bowl, and it was a sampling of pork, beef and chicken that was served over garlic mash potatoes.   We also ordered the caesar salad prepared table side.  This was very impressive and of course delicious.\n\nFor desert I chose the banana cream pie and he chose the double chocolate fudge cake.  They were both superb, which I wasn't expecting any less.\n\nThe service is impeccable.  I have never been to a restaurant this nice and I felt like a queen for the time that we were there.  There were just two of us, but be had three servers attending our table.  While we were waiting to be seated we sat in the bar and we were watching a basketball game.  The maitre d' noticed and kept us updated throughout our dinner with the score.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delicious- from the cocktails to the steaks! Apps: We tried the oysters and bbq shrimp (holy yum!). Entrees: Our party of 6 had all steaks (filet, ribeye and bone-in ribeye) which were all cooked to perfection. One ribeye was very fatty but that's to be expected with that cut and the portion size of the steaks is so that there was plenty to be found that was free of fat- seriously, these steaks are HUGE, definitely share-worthy. Sides: Creamed Corn (VERY yum!), Sauteed Mushrooms (yum), Mashed potatoes (how can you go wrong) and a Twice Baked Potato (a little over done on the bottom but still good regardless). We enjoyed the service and the experience overall. Would highly recommend!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Sweet Jesus, is this place overrated. I realize that top shelf restaurants in Las Vegas are pricey, but discriminating judgment should not be thrown out the window completely. Delmonico's is easily in the bottom third of dining options on the Strip, and maybe even that is too generous. There are at least 5 better options in The Venetian alone. \n\nI've had better rib eye steaks for $0.99. Their wine list sucks, too. I expect an upcharge but if I'm going to pay through the nose, at least give me something that wasn't fermented in a toilet.\n\nSkip Delmonico's. Don't spend your winnings at a crappy, over hyped restaurant. And if you're down, why add insult to injury?
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Beautiful dining room with exposed, double entry wine cellar with wine BINs from floor to ceiling.  Had a business lunch here and enjoyed every bite.  The Truffle Chips (home cut potato chips tossed in truffle oil, garlic, parmesan, and green onions) are rediculously addictive!  Great banquet space, able to privately seat groups of 12ish up to what looked like over 40.  Definitely would recommend.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A friend and I came here a few nights ago, and upon walking in without a reservation we were accommodated immediately. Score! I think we got lucky since it was only 6ish but I recommend making reservations, especially as it was packed when we walked out by 7:30.\n\nOur waiter was incredibly helpful as we sorted through the menu and wine items. I ended up getting the porkchop while my friend got the bone-in ribeye. We also shared the cream corn and garlic smashed potatoes. Our food was served quickly and the red wines we ordered were fantastic - the Tobin James was darker than I usually like it but rich and paired very well with the ribeye. My Meiomi was a bit lighter and fruitier but was a great recommendation for its price.\n\nBe prepared for a BIG meal, the slabs of meat are huge and we barely got through half of our sides. So come hungry! Both the porkchop and ribeye were delicious - flavorful, tender, and juicy. Several waiters came by to check on us which was appreciated.\n\nThe only reason I'm docking a star is for the decor - a bit plain and out of the 90s. Lighting is perfectly dim but hopefully they renovate to match the prices. To be clear though, this is not a reason to not come - the dinner will be worth it!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The food was average at best.  The exceptionally high prices and the quality of the dishes do not match up.  Wife and I chose Delmonico based on reviews.  We left disappointed. The service is what you would expect to find at any high end restaurant.  All of our dishes lacked flavor and the quality of the ingredients were not there as well.  I am really not sure how this place is so well reviewed.  Coming from Boston we could go out every night for three months for a fantastic dinner and never revisit the same restaurant.  With that maybe we are spoiled.  Our bill for the two of us at the end of the night was $250.  Being generous I would say that dinner was worth maybe a third of the cost.  \n\nThe next night we sat at the bar at Seablue in the MGM for a couple of cocktails. I got talking with the bartender and told him about dinner the previous night.  He said "ooh, I wouldn't go there.  I was there years ago and found it to be extremely overpriced and the food just not that good.  I've heard lots of people say not great things about their Delmonico visit." Coincidentally, if you are in the MGM during happy hour visit the Seablue. Shrimp Cocktail are $1 each and are huge.  Coming from the east coast I wouldn't eat shrimp in the desert but on the bartenders recommendation we got some. They were excellent.\n\nIf the restaurant wasn't in the Venetian and visited by thousands of tourists I would guess it would go out of business rather quickly.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is a good steakhouse.  They use an Italian spice on their meat.  I'm generally not a fan of strong spices on meats but it was still good.  I had the strip and it was cooked perfectly.  Great service all around.  The sommelier was very polite and knowledgeable.  He recommend the perfect bottle of wine.  Reservations would be recommended.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My husband and I ate here for Thanksgiving dinner and really enjoyed our meal. \n\nI've eaten at many steakhouses in the area and I find that each one has their own unique style. Delmonico's interior isn't highly decorated or cluttered, just a simple and clean look. I liked the simplicity. \n\nOur waiter and his team were very attentive. Water glasses were constantly filled, plates cleared efficiently, and service moved smoothly. They were all very professional. \n\nThe meal begins with popovers that are both soft and flavorful. I began my meal with the Wilted Spinach and Frisee salad. It was anything, but the usual frisee salad because every ingredient was taken to the next level. The bacon vinaigrette had a nice smoky bacon flavor which was tossed in just the right amount with the spinach. The candied bacon was amazing. They perfectly balanced the sweet and salty. The egg on top was cooked to perfection. All of the flavors worked so well together. \n\nIt was hard to order something other than steak, but it was Thanksgiving so I had to have my traditional dinner. The Thanksgiving dinner didn't disappoint and was a very generous portion. The turkey was very moist and flavorful. The plate had a nice mix of white and dark meat. Under piles of turkey was a moist, delicious cornbread stuffing. A delicious gravy was drizzled over the turkey and stuffing. There was a small side of green beans, but those were not the best thing on the plate as they were a stringy and mushy.\n\nMy husband and I split a Twice Baked Potato because you have to have potatoes on Thanksgiving. I'm glad we split because it was definitely enough for two. The potato was flavorful and covered in a nice cheese layer.\n\nFor dessert I had the Pecan Pie and my husband had the Thanksgiving dessert special. My Pecan Pie was served like a tart in a small round, flaky crust. The crust was buttery and flaky. I don't like crust usually, but this was very good. There was plenty of gooey pecan filing and a nice heap of ice cream on top. My husband's special dessert was a trio of pumpkin cheesecake, bread pudding, and ice cream. This kind of fell flat. Nothing had much flavor and was certainly not the best representation of the dessert menu.\n\nI can't wait to return and try more of the regular menu items.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Fab bistro!\nI'm usually one to choose light dining over a big steak, i must say this is one steak house i want to go back. \nThe services was great! We were lucky enough to have "Vinnie" to help us selecting the right wine for both the rib eye steak and the fish dish.\nWill definitely go back when in Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great food, ambience and staff. The mash potatoes are possibly the best I've ever had! Def try the caramel butter cake with the little mint leaves...delish.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Very busy and noisy restaurant.\nAsparagas was cooked perfectly, however quite flavorless. The mashed potatoes were tasty.  \nFor the price, the spinach should have been fresh and the cream sauce needs improvement. \nMy organic filet was good and nicely cooked to medium rare, however not near as tasty as other organic beef I have had for half the price.\nThe New Orleans gumbo was a tad too salty.  The yorkshire style buns were average and were cold.  \nThe key lime pie was average.  The tartness was lacking.  The apple pie was a disappointment, with a doughy flavoured crust.\nAnother thing that  high end restaurants need to learn is how to choose great coffees like good wines.  I asked where the beans were from and they had no idea.  I would expect excellence in all areas of my food consumption and yes, even with my coffee. The espresso was extremely poor.\nThis is a restaurant that is way overpriced for average to good tasting food.  Nothing was outstanding or excellent.\nSo I can only give it a rating of 2 combining value and flavour.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Stayed at the Venetian and they were advertising how good this restaurant was, so we decided to try it. I was a bit unsure...because the front of the restaurant looked empty (good places are always full!). So we still made reservations and when we arrived we discovered that the actual restaurant portion of the steak house was in a different area and it was a full night!. Our waiter recommended the bone in rib eye which is aged and is their signature plate, and the mashed potatoes. This steak was the best!!! I could not believe how good it was. It was seared and just so good. One order of mashed potatoes is really big so our waiter recommended we shared. We did not even finish that 1 order of tasty mashed potatoes. The service was attentive, and since I love martinis they made me a peach martini.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We came here for my husbands birthday dinner.  We were a few minutes early so had drinks in the lounge, A Tale Of Two Cherries and Louisiana Hard Tea.  Drinks were good and packed a punch.  We started with Barbecue Shrimp and Fried Green Tomatoes.  Barbecue shrimp was the same as at Emeril's other restaurants.  Delicious.  I only wish you got more then 4 shrimp and 1 tiny biscuit.  The fried green tomatoes were one of the nights specials.  They were topped with lump crap and fried light and crisp.  For our Entrees I got Emeril's Barbecue Salmon, he got Bone In Ribeye.  We chose Twiced Baked Potato and Grits for our sides.  Salmon and steak were both wonderful and cooked perfectly.  The sides were creamy and rich, but very similar in flavor.  We loved them both but probably should have order something with more variety.  We finished with Banana Cream Pie and Caramel Butter Cake for dessert.  The Banana Cream Pie is Emeril's signature dessert that is served in all his restaurants.  Hubby loves it and it's a must order for us.  It was our first time ordering the Caramel Butter Cake and it didn't disappoint.  It was served warm and covered in gooey caramel.  Service started off slow, but got better as the meal went on.  We had incorrect charges on our bill that were quickly corrected when we brought it to our servers attention.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I went to Vegas most recently having made reservations at Delmonico ahead of time.  This is my 6th Emeril restaurant to visit. The French style of serving is charming, as always, and the management at this location were eager to please.  We felt a bit rushed at the beginning when our salads arrived seemingly almost immediately after we ordered, but they slowed the pace at our request so that we could savor the experience.  Neither of us were disappointed in our food, and the dessert was quite good.  The barbeque shrimp, if you've never had it, is definitely worth ordering.  But nothing left us talking about it afterword...  \nWhile Delmonico is not going to leave you hungry, it may not leave you marveling, either.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This has been the first time I've been disappointed going to a steakhouse in Vegas. We had a reservation for 8 and Delmonicos and everyone almost hated their steak or fish. I myself had a halibut, but also shared the ribeye. I also had a taste of the lobster bisque. the bisque was very good and could recommend that. but as for the halibut and steak, they were very salty. our whole table said the same thing about the steak and fish. we were very surprised that we were disappointed at an emeril restaurant. maybe the chef in the back had a bad day. in the end, you wont see me here again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Came here for a celebration, the only reason I chose this place was because I am a HUGE fan of banana cream pie, and all the reviews on here were raving about it. So I figured why not?! \n\nRight away, you realize that this place is trying to be something special. I say trying because it doesn't quite get it right. You do have 2 servers, and they pay attention to every little detail, which is great. I mean I was only thinking that i needed another iced tea, and before I could signal for one, the server had one ready for me. Great!!!\n\nHowever, I got the feeling everyone was trying a little to hard, I could tell only because everyone was so nervous and stumbling either over their words or the presentation of the food. \n\nFood wise, the food was GREAT! The steak was literally falling apart, I didn't even have to use any force at all to cut my filet. It was like thick beef jerky, if you can imagine that!!!\n\nHighly Recommended!!!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	People looking for a steak fix should definitely head over here for a yummy steak. The salad was a absolutely delicious. The mushrooms melted in my mouth and were just so good.\nMy wife and I both had soup as an appetizer, Something this place is very well known for. I had the shrimp gumbo, now that was great gumbo. My wife had the fillet minion and I tried the Cajun Steak which was just so tender and juicy, talk about perfection here.\nWe also had the asparagus, how perfectly cooked.\nI decided to have a yummy baked potato with my dinner,  butter and sour cream right along with it. Delmonico is by far the best steakhouse I have ever been to in Las Vegas.\nThe waiter  was very friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. The owner is the great Emeril Lagasse, the guy that yells BAM!!!! on his cooking show. Come here if you want the best steak ever.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Since this was my birthday trip we wanted(I wanted) a great steak dinner. As if I need a reason for a good piece of meat. We arrive 15 mins before our reservation and within 2 mins are seated. The place looks like an art museum very light and earthy colors. The seats are a bit uncomfortable as someone also stated. They are leather office chair styled, I kept sliding off of them. Now enough of that, the food: the server: Darren comes around and gives us menus we look it over- I see what I'm ordering- the filet $48, side $9 and I also want an appetizer $18 damn $80 and that's just my meal. Now I'm used to spending this on sushi so I wasn't vexed. My poor husband who until me, wasn't used to spending so much on a meal was sweating. Ha! I'm just kidding, so to be semi fair we order the gumbo $10 split, the bread they have is phenomenal a cross between hawaiian bread & monkey bread, and it gets served one by one for each person.  Kind of annoying because it's that good but it comes out fresh so one can't complain. The gumbo is decent enough for a restaurant such as this. We order the chateaubriand $105 for a beautiful piece of steak, garlic smashed potatoes, and asparagus for two. Bam! Look @ me saving us money. This was our first time having the chateaubriand and this will not be my last, very well seasoned w/ herbs& spices and nice encrusted char. It was more than enough food for two. And @ the end of our meal they brought me a candle lit sorbet sweet treat for the bday girl. Our service was top notch from start to finish. A well worth $200.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We arrived 20 mins late to our reservation and were so thankful they were accommodating. The bone-in ribeye, beef tartar, and every other appetizer we ordered was delicious. The meat didn't have too much fat which was the best part. Other steakhouses will serve your steak with bigger chunks of fat, so I felt like I was getting my money's worth here. The service was okay. Dress code tip: It's a nice restaurant but not extremely fancy.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Didn't like the steak there . I ask for medium rare but it was wel done and cold . I am not going back there agian .
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I was actually disappointed a bit by my meal at Delmonico's. I got the duck and it was overcooked. The cane syrup sauce did help bring out the flavor but it was still well done and I was not given the option when I ordered the duck as to how rare/well done I would like it. I do understand that it is a steakhouse, however if it is on the menu it needs to be of equal quality as the red meat.\nAlso, I tasted the mint ice cream profiteroles and the bread pudding served with butter pecan ice cream. Both house made ice creams were the best I'd ever tasted with a fantastic creaminess and balanced flavor, however the bread in both desserts were superfluous, didn't add anything and just weren't that spectacular.\nThe service we received was fantastic.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Best steakhouse we've been to yet. Our wine pairing was on point. Absolutely excellent service, highly recommend!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Typical day in Vegas couldn't decide where to eat (too many choices). Decided to go to Delmonico Steakhouse in the Venetian. Service was pretty prompt as usual with this place. We ordered the Caesar Salad that was prepared table side, I believe I ordered a  bone in rib-eye and my girlfriend ordered the salmon. All of the food was prepared well and service was perfection. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and family.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The restaurant looks like it needs an upgrade. The finishes are starting to wear and the bathrooms were not nicely appointed. The restaurant was nicely spread out, though. Tables were spaced so there was plenty of room to move and afforded some privacy.\n\nThe food, unfortunately, was mediocre. I opted for the pork chops at medium temperature. They were tasty, but very overdone and dry. The appetizers and salads were lovely, though.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Everything from the starters to the dessert was amazing. Highly recommended. Only loss of a star was for the restaurant decor. Very boring.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Wonderful service, awesome steak and sides. They were very accommodating to my gluten allergy. Wonderful experience.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	While at Vegas, our friends out of the blue, wanted to go eat at a nice restaurant for dinner since it was fight night and all the clubs would have a long line. They made the reservations around 4pm for a 9:30pm dinner, so making reservations last minute isn't a problem.\n\nThough we arrived on time, we had to wait at least 15 minutes to get seated, so we just waited at the bar. I thought the bar area looked better than the actual dining area itself. It was modern and sleek, with a piano situated at the far side of the room.\n\nOur hostess took us into the dining area, where we were immediately greeted by our smiling waitress. Very attentive, nice, and down to earth, explained the specials and menu to us. Meanwhile, the busboys/girls gave us hot bread, which my Filipino friends said tasted like Filipino bread. It was topped with finely grated cheese and salt, and they loved it. Our waters were constantly refilled before it was even half empty.\n\nWe all ordered either the rib-eye off the bone ($42), or the bone in rib-eye ($46). 14 to 16 oz. for the rib-eye. I tried both the steaks and they tasted the same to me. It was dry-aged 14 days, which you could tell when you sliced the meat with your knife. Tender, flavorful, delicious! I loved that the sides were encrusted with pepper and salt. My other friend ordered the filet-mignon, which she could not finish. I loved how it melted in your mouth and it was also very flavorful. We got the country smashed potatoes, the baked idaho potato, and the roasted fingerling potatoes. The roasted fingerling potatoes tasted the best. I thought it was perfect the way it was salted. The other 2 potatoes didn't stand out to me. \n\nDecor was minimal and sort of disappointing. The bathrooms were kind of disgusting to me because it seemed as if they didn't clean it much. The meal was delicious, but I still love Mastro's more! \n\nAt the end of our meal, one of the waiters kept coming by our table asking us if we needed help with our bill (because we had a party of 9). He came FIVE TIMES. It was SUPER annoying and it seemed that he was afraid we'd dine and run or something just because it was taking awhile for us to figure out how to calculate tax and tip and collecting money from people.\n\nI'd definitely come here again, but after I try other steakhouses in Vegas!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great steaks, great service and the banana cream pie was over the top.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Just hit this place for the 3rd time in 2 years and this place never let's down.  I was there just this past weekend during a very busy time at the Venetian with 2 major conventions going on.  We were fortunate enough to get a reservation with the host we prefer at 7:30 pm.  Game on!!\n\nService is impeccable.  We have a specific host who takes care of us when we come in so I suggest you get to know yours cause it does make getting reservations much easier.  Not only that, but you have a better time in general when you feel you have a friend there.  And trust me, I'm no high roller.\n\nEach section has its own host and several supporting cast.  Some hosts are better than others so again if you like yours try to stick with him/her.  They usually start you with an amuse bouche compliments of the chef.  Always different and always outstanding.  It's no meal just a way of getting your taste buds started.  The food will be brought as per normal or as you request.  You're in control so let them know what you want and they will help you better.  Even with wine selections of which they have a large selection.  The place can get a lot of hustle (not normal) so just try to sit tight and enjoy your meal.  They won't rush you so don't rush yourself.  \n\nI go straight for the steak but i hear the appetizers are fantastic.  I highly recommend the Wet/Dry Aged Bone In Rib Eye Medium.  The outside will be crusted just right with a pat of house made butter on top.  Inside will be pink and juicy (order med/rare if you want blood) and soft not chewy.  The meat will melt in your mouth as this cut has just the right amount of marbling (great now I want one).  Desert?  The steak is desert enough for me (lol).  \n\nService is impeccable.  We have a specific host who takes care of us when we come in so I suggest you get to know yours cause it does make getting reservations much easier.  Not only that, but you have a better time in general when you feel you have a friend there.  And trust me, I'm no high roller.\n\nDon't forget, Bone in Rib Eye!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I really like Delmonico's.  I've dined here multiple times and have never been disappointed in either the service or the food.  We decided to have lunch here on our most recent Vegas excursion.  My dad tried to get reservations for noon, but was told that they could seat us at 12:30pm instead.  No biggie.\n\nWhen we arrived, there were only about two other tables occupied.  Not sure why we couldn't come in at noon, but whatever.  We ordered the potato chips with truffle oil and parmesan as our app.  I never thought of potato chips as a gourmet dish, but now I know better.  Excellent!\n\nMy sister and I split the salmon which had a bbq-esque sauce and was served with onion strings.  The waiter actually asked how we would like to have our salmon prepared.  I've never had a waiter ask that before.  Pretty cool.  We also shared a side of broccoli (gotta eat your veggies) and the twice baked potato with white cheddar and bacon (OMG!).  So yummy!\n\nFor dessert we all split two of the infamous banana cream pies.  Can you say holy banana goodness?  Another OMG moment!  In all honesty, that pie is one of the main reasons we went to Delmonico's.  ;)\n\nI would highly recommend dining at Delmonico's if you are in the neighborhood.  Be prepared for a leisurely meal (service can be slow, but it is relaxing) and some delicious food.  Bon appetit!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've been to Ruth's, Mastro's, The Palm, & Morton's and I will have to say that the Rib-Eye (not bone-in) I had here was the BEST I have ever had (not that the others were bad). \n\nI may be partial to the spice "rub"/"crust" they put on it which is not traditional for high end steak places which favor only salting their meat, but honestly I wish other places seasoned their meats a little more. It was truly delicious. My brother ordered the NY and my aunt ordered the Filet and they were both in agreement I had the best tasting steak.\n\nThe service was exactly what you would expect and demand from a place in this price range and all the sides and appetizers were definitely good (but not great).\n\nTheir wine list is literally an encyclopedia of wine so it was a little intimidating and I opted for a glass of Scotch instead. \n\nIn comparison to some of the newer & flashier spots like SW & CUT the ambiance is a little muted but its still classy. Like I stated, go here and order the regular Rib Eye.. I highly doubt you will be disappointed.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Amazing restaurant. Lets start off by saying really goood waiter. Portions were big and very tasty aswell. Will definitely  be coming back
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I went to Delmonico with a large group for a friend's birthday recently.  There were about 20 of us, split up over 3 circular tables.  It would have been great to have one long table, but I understand the constraint.  We were seated as soon as the birthday girls arrived after having a drink at the bar.  The service was excellent!  There were a lot of us and the staff was courteous and knowledgable about the menu and the wine list.  \n\nLet me preface my review of the food by saying that I don't eat red meat.  I know steak is their speciality, so I was knowing order what they don't go best.  I started with the shrimp cocktail, which included 4 large shrimp, cocktail sauce and some garnish.  The shrimp were cooked very well, but it was a regular shrimp cocktail.  The cajun marinade imparted a little extra kick, but nothing remarkable.  Next, I had the snapper entree.  Almost everyone else at my table ordered the rib eye, which was enormous.  Like Man vs. Food big.  The piece of snapper looked so tiny in the bowl next to the big steaks!  In all honesty though, it was a regular portion.  The lentils were a great addition, as were the brussel sprouts.  However, the fish seemed to have been sitting out for a while.  The top was dry like it had been under the heat lamps.  I understand that it's tough to coordinate one peice of fish when you have to prepare 15+ rib eyes for the same set of tables, but that snapper still cost me $40.  I didn't have dessert since we brought a cake, but the coffee at the end was good.  I'm not saying that I wouldn't return to Delmonico, but knowing there are so many other steakhouses in Vegas that have a stronger reputation for seafood, if it's my choice, I'd probably choose to go elsewhere.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My mom lives in Vegas so I am there all the time and we try a lot of the nicer restaurants in town.  Delmonico Steakhouse was one of the better ones.  We were a little early for our reservation so we sat in the bar and ordered a few drinks.  The hostess then called our name after only a couple of minutes so we did not get our drinks in the bar but they brought them to the table and added them to our bill.  It was a very smooth process.  For dinner, I had the fillet Mignon with blue cheese melted on it.  It was delicious.  The steak was a tad undercooked for my taste but I did order medium rare.  I guess I was expecting the norm where other restaurants cook medium rare closer to medium.  But overall the steak was delicious.  Good flavor and I loved the blue cheese.  My mom had the rack of lamb.  Again a little too undercooked for her taste but they truly cooked it to medium rare.  We shared the twice baked potatoes with cheese and bacon.  Yummy!  The bread was good too.  We had a great main waiter and his assistants.  Everyone treated us well and in a timely manner.  Definitely a place I will go again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	There are many good steakhouses. This is a GREAT one. I had the shrimp cocktail which was excellent - big shrimp not over cooked. The wedge was great with real bacon and plenty of blue cheese crumbles. The bone-in ribeye was the best I have had. Great seasoning. Nice crust. Perfectly cooked. The banana creme pie was huge. Sinful. OMG I am so stuffed.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Really nice ribeye but not great. It had really good flavor but not quite as tender as I expected for prime beef. \nThe service was great and so were the sides and salads.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had dinner with the guys so we reserved the chef table in back with wine pairing and a tour of the restaurant. It was definitely the best dinner experience I had in Las Vegas. \n\nOne of the dishes was a quail which I normally am not fond of but they did such a good job I devoured it. The wine pairing was excellent and they were generous with their pours. I even took a full glass back to my room at the end of the night. Excellent service and food! My new favorite place!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Best place for a killer steak in the venetian. Always on my top list when visiting or dining with friends/clients.  Amazing food, amazing service. Wish we had more stars, I'd still give it 100%
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This Emeril namesake kicks ass.  Tableside caesar isnt my favorite ive ever had but its unique.  All the steaks at our table were perfectly prepared (including a non-butterflied Medium well steak).  Ambiance was free of "BAM!", very rich, elegant, a little loud, but leaves little to be desired. \n\nService was excellent, insane wine list, insane coffee list, limited Emeril.\n\nI will be back here for another special occasion or business dinner soon.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Looking at all the reviews, maybe I went on an off night, but I've had better steaks at home on my own grill from the local market.  Went with a group of 9 and ordered the "surf and turf" consisting of the ribeye and a seafood mashed potato combo.\n\nThe good - Mashed potatoes were excellent, generous lump seafood, very tasty.  Side dishes also were excellent.\n\nThe disappointing - The ribeye.  Ordered it medium rare, as did my friend next to me.  Both of our steaks were probably cooked closer to medium, neither was juicy or tender, there seemed to be no marbled fat content at all, and the texture was almost grainy.\n\nI'll eat everything from In N Out to more foodie type establishments, always with a smile on my face, but this experience was a bit of a shock to me.  I've had ribeyes for 1/3 the price but infinitely better.  \n\nWeird.  But I think I'd rather try somewhere else as I wouldn't want a repeat experience at that price point.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We have been several times now and it is a wonderful experience. Truly special. The staff are so friendly and attentive. They recommended dishes for us based on our likes. It really felt like they were committed to ensuring we were well cared for during our entire time. When we ordered coffee one of our friends went to the restroom. We were all enjoying our coffee when she returned. No sooner had she sat down one of the servers filled her cup so it would be nice and hot. It's those special touches that make this place so special. Now for the food. Delicious! The bone in ribeye is amazing and the salmon is delightful. The sides are served family style and honestly you cannot go wrong with any of them. We loved the corn dish was our favorite. We cannot thank the staff enough for such a wonderful dining experience.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Emril Lagasi's snazzy steak house at the Venetian.  The big brown leather chairs have stuck in my mind.  Filet was cooked to perfection.  Service was very attentive.  We left happy.  Will probably head back after experiencing some more of what Vegas has to offer.  So much to see... so little time!\n\nI would give it 4.5 stars if I could, but I am going to have to agree about the ambiance - a bit on the bright side (sights n'sound).  In the end, Delmonico's seemed to be a consistent and classic dining experience.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Back to Delmonico three more times for great Louisiana Caviar atop sumptuous Deviled Eggs; light and airy Popovers; mellow Lobster Bisque; traditional black New Orleans Gumbo; fine French Onion Soup; Caesar Salad prepared tableside; buttery medium rare Creekstone Prime Grade Filet Mignon paired with perfectly seasoned Duck Fat Fingerling Potatoes; a nice mix of Garlic Sauteed Mushrooms; coffee prepared with Jamaican coffee beans; amazingly delicious Emeril's Banana Cream Pie with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, and Whipped Cream; very memorable Pecan Pie with Oatmeal Shortbread Crust, Vanilla Ice Cream, and Caramel Sauce; and most recently for lunch during Restaurant Week a humongous 15-ounce Prime Grade medium rare Bacon Cheeseburger on a Sesame-Seeded Brioche Bun dressed with tomato slices, lettuce, White Onions, ketchup, and mayo topped by a juicy pickle segment accompanied by very tasty homemade lightly browned French Fries glistening with a sheen of Duck Fat.  \n\nOnce Diane did not receive her Maitre-D Butter, and her steak arrived with some char and pepper after her specific request not to.  But otherwise food preparation and service were impeccable and working in tandem like a well-oiled machine.  When an apparent miscommunication resulted in receipt of Sauteed Spinach instead of Creamed Spinach, a side of Creamed Spinach was voluntarily and quickly brought to the table as well, without charge.  Both dishes were outstanding.\n\nOur Restaurant Week lunch culminated in a fine finish with a rich Banana Cream Pie Parfait with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream and Graham Crumbs for me; and traditional Bread Pudding with lip-smacking warm Caramel Pecan Sauce for Diane.  For us, based on past experiences, there is every reason to return again for more epicurean delights.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had the occasion to eat here recently and although it was gook, it honestly didn't meet my expectations.  Of course everyone is going to have different expectations. Maybe because it's Emeril's but I was expecting just something much better.  \n\nWe had a party of 6 and they seated us at this huge round table.  You had to talk very loudly in order for the other side of the table to hear you, which just contributes to the already loud atmosphere.  \n\nThe food was on par for a steak house of this caliber though a little on the high side, which is premium you pay for the Lagasse name.  I can't review anything that already hasn't been said.  I had the rib eye which was good, sides I can't even remember.  Bread as others have mentioned was not memorable.  I'll have to disagree with others about the banana cream pie..  just didn't seem to have the flavor I was expecting.. just a lot of not sweet enough whipped cream.\n\nService was great though.\n\nWill probably not go back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico, the trivia first. \nDelmonico doesn't have Emeril Lagasse's name on it, however it is his establishment. Word is he signed a contract with MGM properties so no other place on the strip can use his name outside of the MGM properties. The only mention you will see is his first name mentioned in the dessert selection, other than that nothing.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and the waiter service is killer. However the food was lacking, the steak although cooked to perfection lacked some flavor and they do not mention how large the steaks are. Thepetit filet mignon was tiny, six ounces for sixty dollars which included three overcooked shrimp lobster topped. \n\nThe frog legs were good, a different for once and their selection of fine drinks is a good selection.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We were very disappointed with our meal. The waiter had absolutely no knowledge of the wine selection and therefore could not provide any recommendations. The steaks were flavorless and not cocked as requested. The side of broccoli was lukewarm and wine glasses were dirty. The best part of the meal was the caramel butter cake dessert and Fisticuffs cabernet.  We go to steakhouses quite often and Delmonico's ranks towards the very bottom of our list.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We had dinner reservations to celebrate a special event. We started off with a few drinks.\n\nFried Soft-Shell Crab:\nAn appetizer with poached egg, frisee salad and lemon truffle vinaigrette. Lightly breaded and fried. Not greasy, not fatty and the shell was definitely soft. The citrusy salad compliments the dish. One of the best soft-shell crab versions I've had. We got 2 orders of these - they were that good. 5/5\n\nFilet Mignon:\nSince I'm not a fan of animal fat, this is what I normally get. Some people may find it boring but I like my steak simple and lean. Very tender and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. This piece of meat didn't photograph very well since it looks so dark from all the pepper but it tasted good. 4/5\n\nChateaubriand:\nThe second most tender and lean cut of meat. We got mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. 4/5\n\nBone-In Ribeye:\nDry-aged prime with butter on top. Superb! 4/5\n\nFoie Gras:\nThis was a side item. Perfectly seared and mildly sweet. You don't really need to do much to make foie gras taste good. KISS (keep it simple, stupid!) 4.5/5\n\nMushrooms with Garlic:\nThis side was really good. I love mushrooms and garlic. The mushrooms did not have just a hint of garlic. They were deliciously garlicky. 5/5\n\nGrits:\nThis has bacon and good melted cheese which makes this more interesting than it should be. I wouldn't normally eat grits but this was good. 4/5\n\nCreme Brulee:\nI've been feeling tired of this dessert. I didn't find joy in eating this. Plain, ordinary and too safe. 2/5\n\nDelmonico Coquetel:\nGin, sparkling dessert wine, five spice-infused simple syrup, ruby red grapefruit and lime juices. Their signature cocktail...but why? Our server was right, I should've not wasted my time on this. It was too sweet and it just didn't taste right. I took a few sips and our server knew it was time for a different drink. 2/5\n\nA Tale of Two Cities:\nCherry vodka, elderflower liqueur, black cherry juice and citrus juices. This was deliciously amazing if you like cherry. 5/5\n\nAnother drink we had was a martini with bleu cheese-stuffed olives. Since I'm not a fan of martini, olives or bleu cheese - it would not be fair for me to rate this. We got a free chocolate gelato and it was good. Service was good. Our server gave us recommendations and what to stay away from. Honesty is always appreciated.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is a good steak place but not like the best steak ever, it's owned by Emeril, so most of the dishes has this unique Creole / Louisianna taste...If your staying at the Venetian this is a good place to get your steak fix =)...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Bone in rib eye.  Disgunstingly delicious.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	was in vegas for a wedding & did the fancy/smancy thing cuz i love to eat...big fan of the food network & this guys antics on tv...but this place was horrid & over priced~it fits the picture of u receiving a small piece of the main course & paying like $50/plate wit no sides~calamari was watered down...trus me im all about payin the big bucs if its quality....this one wasnt....this was the only party pooper of the sin city trip
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Best bone in ribeye I've ever had. Drinks were great. Wine list is exceptional. Recommend to anyone looking for a top shelf steakhouse in Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	What better way to celebrate a big 3-0 than with a mean piece of steak! It was my good friend's birthday and we had two tables reserved for our big group. I must say, service was stellar. Staff was knowledgeable with their menu and very patient with us when placing our orders in as we were all quite indecisive and had so many questions.   \n\nStarting off with some bread and aperitif, I chose a glass of Blue label Chimay as my poison. Ahhhh...a wonderful prelude to an evening of indulgence. For appetizers, I had their OYSTER ROCKEFELLER. This baked aphrodisiac was not as cheesy as I hoped it would be but they were fresh and of good quality. I can't complain. \n\nNext came the main show, BONE-IN RIBEYE which my man and I split. Split plating was beautifully done with the perfect portion for each of us. No fee for split plate, thank you. I like my meat cooked medium and it came as pink as I expected it to be. A dollop of butter topped off my steak but that for me was unnecessary. It had quite a chew to it which was unlikely coming from Chef Emeril Lagasse's kitchen. Did it taste bad? No, not at all. I just think that being in Vegas where you are surrounded by a plethora of dining options of the same caliber, you need to live up to your name. Sadly, I wasn't as impressed by this dish compared to other fellow Yelpers. \n\nMy side of choice was the CREAMED SPINACH. Now we're talking! It tasted sensational with that silky feel of butter and cream. Finally, Chef Emeril's true colors are coming out. And on a sweet note, we ended the evening with EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE. Can I say, WOW!? I will have to say this was the best banana cream pie I've had to date. Hats off to you, Chef! This my friends, earned Delmonico Steakhouse the 4 stars I'm giving them. \n\nWould I come back? Sure! I'll skip the steak and try his southern specialties instead. But more importantly, I shall not forget EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE. It's to die for!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The staff, servers (Michael and Co.) went beyond our expectations for service.  We were celebrating our anniversary, and they provided both an appetizer and dessert for free.The atmosphere is casual elegant, not stuffy, but very beautiful in a simple way.  You must try the Caesar salad, made for two at the table, AMAZING!!  We both had a steak, my NY Strip not quite as flavorful as partner's Rib Eye, which was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten.  The entire meal experience was unforgettable, and the pricetag, although steep, was worth it. We will return.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	It has been a few years since my 1 and only visit. I recall it being highly overrated. I am from Texas and have been to many steakhouses. First of all, the high-end white tablecloth fancy decor with everyone in suits and ties is not fitting for a steakhouse.\n\nThe steaks were not memorable and I have had much better for less money.  I do not recall if the steaks are grilled or broiled but I do recall mine was overcooked and for such a high-end fancy place, I would expect better.\n\nIf you are looking for quality steak in Vegas and willing to spend some cash, I would try many others before this place.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went to Emril's Delmonico last night for dinner and to sum up the experience was grossly underwhelmed from start to finish.\n\nAtmosphere: the general atmosphere and ambiance is exactly what you'd expect from a fine-dining Casino restaurant. Clean and well-kept. \n\nService: The service was generally pretty good from the two support staff assisting our primary server. Our main server, however, was quite underwhelming to say the least. It was apparent from the moment he greeted us that he wasn't enthused to have a 2 top sit down (at a table for 2 no less). I mentioned to the server that I was interested in an appetizer to share, but didn't want something so large as to prevent me from fully enjoying the steak I had decided on. He ignored my question for a suggestion. I've never had that happen, anywhere, let alone a fine-dining establishment. The worst part, however, came to the bill. To set the stage, we were seated adjacent to two other 2-top tables, one of which was behind us in the meal progression, the other who was ahead of us. Several moments after our dessert and after dinner-drinks were dropped off, our bill was placed on our table with the statement "I'll take this as soon as you are ready." Interesting . . . I looked at the table next to us, who had already finished dessert and they did not have their bill yet. And on top of that, he failed to ask us if we wanted anything else, which had he asked, he would have realized that my wife would have liked more hot water for her tea. My wife was also thoroughly irritated with the fact that the bill was explicitly placed within my reach, and not hers. She made it a point to the server that she was the one who wished to pay.\n\nFood: We were both completely and 100% underwhelmed with everything we ordered. I had the "house special" which was a dry aged, bone-in ribeye, reportedly seasoned with Emril's Essence. It was a good steak. Not great by any means, and most certainly not worth the $52 price tag. The flavor was mediocre (surprising since its purportedly dry-aged), and the cook highly inconsistent. It was ordered medium rare, and parts were rare, others were medium. Very disappointing and suggestive of an amateur grill chef. I'm quite content to pay that much and far more for a good steak, however, I expect to get what I pay for, and this was most certainly not it. I've had far superior steaks for less than 1/2 that price.  My wife ordered the snapper, and it was so overcooked that it was mostly inedible. Also had the mushroom side, which was generally pretty good.\n\nThe dessert, however, was quite good. The banana creme pie.\n\nPerhaps we went on an off night, however, this experience coupled with the abundance of other restaurants on the strip, is enough for me to never return.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Been here 4 times now. Was in the process of making this place one of those restaurants you gotta visit every time you come into town. Well, I don't feel that way so much any more after our last two visits\nService is outstanding.  No complaints when you're pampered.  But there are tons of staff which may explain the prices here. Looked to me like a 3 person team was assigned to 3 tables. Doesn't include the guy bringing the food or the floaters moving about \nThe quality of the food is merely average. 3 of us went, total bill was $360, no drinks.  The BBQ salmon was good, but the overpowering BBQ sauce hid the salmon flavor. My better half had the rack of lamb which she sent back for more cooking because it was raw in the middle. It came back hotter but nearly as raw. She gave up 1/2 through because of all the fat and the rawness. I tried a rib and found it average.  Costco has rack of lamb. Not as meaty but more flavorful than Delmonico.  But that depends on the chef. I had the bone in rib eye, asked for it med rare but it was mostly raw. The tail end was all fat. The flavor was average. For me, part of the cooking process is to turn a steak into a masterpiece. It starts with a prime cut of beef. Apparently, they were out of prime quality steers. This steak had no marbling, just huge fatty areas and lots of tough connective tissue. The tenderness and the tastiness you find in the outer rim of a rib eye wasn't there.  I had to saw through every piece of this steak. Maybe I had a crappy knife.  We had the cream corn and smashed potatoes, both were average. \nEverything here I could have made at home with better quality and with way more flavor for 1/4 the price. So I'll leave with Foodie's Helpful hints:\nStart with better quality ingredients. Learn what blue, rare, medium rare and so on are. Learn the point when to remove fish from the heat so it retains its natural flavors and moistness. Don't drown anything in sauce.  Spend some time in the kitchen outside working hours, experimenting, getting the broil and grill times right. Add alittle spice to the popovers might make them really stand out. Allow those steaks to sit outside the refrigerator to warm up before plopping them on a grill. It makes a huge difference  Add fresh corn to the creamed corn. Maybe that will add a little crunch instead of leaving a baby food texture. Liven up your tired old spuds. Liven up all your food.\nOverall the food quality is 2 stars. The service adds another star.   From now on, we will come here only for the $12 slice of Banana Cream Pie, which is to die for unless the quality starts slipping.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	5 stars for our waitress. Her service was impeccable.\n\n1 star for the food. 3 of 4 dishes had to be sent back. For an upscale restaurant that's unacceptable.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ordered ribeye bone.  it was excellent!  juicy, tasty.  now, i'm not sure if it's because of the type (with the bone), or the butter they put on top of it.  bread.. they only provided one kind and it was mediocre.  wine was good (based on their recommendation).\n\ngiving only 4 star because of the bread and the service.  they only provided one kind and even so it was just so-so.  would've been nice for them to invest a bit more in it, as a nice complement before the steak arrive.\nsecondly, the service.  was not as good as wolfgang puck's the cut.  but since i care more about the food, i still give delmonico the trophy over the cut.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Amazing!! The food was delicious!  I ordered the lobster soup as an entrée and the Salmon on a bed of potatoes it was amazing! My husband had Steak and potatoes it was cooked to perfection. It is pricey but worth every penny. We will definitely be back for our anniversary.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I was the best man and thus we came to vegas, we saw, and we ate at Delmonico's (among other things).\n\nTable for 13 men out on the town for my friend's bachelor party.\n\nI can't remember what everyone ordered but I can tell you that nobody complained about the food (not drunk yet and therefore enjoyed the food fully).\n\nThe bone-in Ribeye was marvelous.  The Calamari was good as was the steak tartare. Side dishes: New Orleans Creamed Spinach, Truffle Parmesan Potato Chips and Sautéed Garlic Mushrooms were all excellent!  The sides are quite large so please share because yeah, we ordered too many.\n\nTotal bill for 13 (which included some drinks) was about $1100 which is not bad for a nice high-end place that serves THE BEST RIBEYE.  If you like porterhouse, then go try the porterhouse at Keens steakhouse in NYC.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've heard criticism from others on Delmonico's. Out of the 10 or so times I've been here, always with at least three others at a time or more, I've never had a bad meal. The steaks are superb (I love their bone in rib steak - too big to eat in one sitting -but I manage it anyway), along with their sides, and finally their banana creme pie is to die for - and I normally NEVER order this - I was converted in a hurry and convinced friends who thought I was nuts to try it - they too are converted followers.  Haven't been there in about six months, need to go back next trip soon.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Fantastic experience. It was our third wedding anniversary. The wait staff was excellent and the Chateaubriand was incredible. The French Onion soup was to die for. I would highly recommend this place, especially for a special occasion.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went here with a large group. Good steak.  Sides were only decent. Overall a 4 star meal.  I would go back if asked, but would not plan the meal here. There is better in town.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The thing about fine dining establishments is that there's a heck of a chance you'll leave without having had your fill, so you're encouraged to empty your wallet even more for all the trimmings.\n\nDon't make that mistake at Delmonico Steakhouse, even if everything looks and is delicious.\n\nAlmost everything at Emeril's restaurant here is sharable.  I was here for a couple friends' birthdays, and everybody at my table ordered one appetizer to go with the steaks we ordered.  As good as everything was, we just ended up staring at our food 20 minutes after being served.\n\nAs for the food, as I stated, it's all terrific.  The complimentary bread is some of the best I've ever had.  They're delicate to the touch, and when you bite into it, the texture is flakier than a croissant.  I didn't even know that was possible with a roll.  \n\nI had the lobster bisque as an appetizer, which was creamy and some decent chunks of lobster in it.  For the record, I actually finished it.  Another person at our table ordered the seafood tower which is something you should get on a big baller budget, but everything from the oysters, to the lobster, and crab claws were scrumptious.  The country smashed potatoes, sauteed garlic mushrooms, truffle parmesan potato chips, and duck fat fingerling potatoes?  All amazing.\n\nNow, the steak.  Most of them are dry-aged, so we're talking $$$ here, but like my fellow Yelper Ferdinand L. said, do not attempt to have a steak without the foie gras on top.  If you've never had foie gras before, this is the time to do it.  The result is something you'll simply salivate over.\n\nNow it wasn't the best steak I ever had, but it was one of those situations where after eating here, I know most things after will be a disappointment, so choose your next meal wisely.  My whole table had the meat stares, and only one person at the table finished their entree.\n\nJust a great dining experience.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Absolutely outstanding food.  Top notch.  The best.\n\nI had the Bone in NY Strip and it's the best steak I've had in recent memory.  I ordered a little side of horseradish on the side and the two went very well together.  The steak fries were great also.\n\nThe staff was great and took very good care of us.\n\nIt's a tad bit loud and the ambiance isn't great.\n\nBut if you want a good steak, you'd be hard pressed to find a better one than Delmonico's serves.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My wife and I just celebrated an anniversary here.  The food and servers were excellent and very friendly.  The Piedmontese New York was surprisingly good.\n\nWhat cost the restaurant a better rating was how we were greeted by the host staff.  While I was checking in, the hostess turned away to seat someone that just walked up as I was giving my name.  I was so surprised and offended that I was prepared to leave.\n\nAnother host saw this and quickly jumped in and had us seated right away.  Kudos to him for the save, but still there was no apology issued.\n\nFirst impressions are important.  We never expected anything like this at a restaurant of this caliber, especially one associated with Emeril Lagasse.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I love a good steak. Filets are my favorite. I have to say that the Filet I had at the Delmonico Steakhouse was one of the best I've ever had. Maybe even the best. The char on it was perfect, the inside a perfect medium. If I had one complaint - it'd be that I didn't order two of them.\n\nThe side dishes and dessert were also delicious, and the service was amazing as well. Of course, the price was expensive, but I would hope no one going to this restaurant would be surprised by the price. You get what you pay for.\n\nI'm keeping the review short - if you don't mind paying good money for a great meal, then go here. You will not regret it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Came here as a recommendation from my brother and his wife. They had only been here for their lunch, but we came for their dinner.\n\nEasy to make a reservation through yelp via open table. Confirmed.\n\nCame here and ordered their famous bone-in-ribeye. Had the oysters and shrimp for appetizer. Cream spinach as a side to share. \n\nOysters:\nSort of like the Rockerfeller oysters... I liked it. Not the best but it was good.\n\nShrimp:\nThe sauce was Louisiana style, good but the shrimp was cooked too long. It came out a little 'old'. \n\nBone in Ribeye:\nThe flavors were strong and was there. It had that distinct iron? grilled tast to it. Juicy as well but too chewy for me. Some parts were a bit dry.But it is huge!\n\nCreme spinach:\nToo salty for me but other then that, good.\n\nFood: a-ok, 3 stars.\nService: 5 stars.\n\nWhy? We told them we were going to catch the show for Ka at the MGM Grand and seating started at 7:30. They made sure everything came out fast and had our check ready for us so we would leave in time. I didn't feel rushed at all, and they were glad to help us out. Thank you! :)\n\nI would recommend going there once.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great service and the best cooked steaks my wife and I have had in the US. The cocktails and sides are also delicious. Pricey but worth it
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Been wanting to come here , and outta all the times i been to vegas, finally i get here.\n\nEscargot was DELICIOUS\nceasar salad was also good\nStuffed crabs were small but very good\n\nHalibut was not oily andbuttery but tasty\nRibeye with foie gras on top was to die for\nFilet was very tasty! loved it\n\nSides: the mushrooms were amazing! garlic and butter \n\nDESSERTTT ... banana cream pie , i almost licked the plate\n\nAlso a bottle of syrah\n\nTotal 2 couples.. 600+ after 20% grad.\n\nGreat ambiance and service was impeccable\n\nDef coming back
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I guess the 4th time is the charm!!  My brother was nice enough to get us a gift certificate here so even though we didn't really want to come back here again we decided to order things we wouldn't normally get at a steakhouse.  Stuff like chateaubriand which was fn awesome and way better than anything else I had there the last 3 times.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Let me start by saying I don't  eat red meat but I decided to try Delmonico Steakhouse because I knew  the other proteins and veggies would be delicious and I knew all the other people in our group would love it. I was not disappointed at all....the halibut was perfect.  Veggie on the table were severed family style which made it easy to share and try everything: mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, mashed potatoes, twice baked potato, and regular baked potato.  The mushrooms were my personal favorite but everything was great. Other proteins  on our table: pork chop, rack of lamb, ribeye, NY strip, and filet mignon, while I didn't try them everyone in our group loved their dish, nothing but happy faces in our party. The service was stellar and the pop overs were mouth-wateringly delicious.  Also had the bbq shrimp appetizer and truffle potato chips both were great not a crumb left on the plate. Cocktail wise the Dorian Gray was sweet with a bit of punch at the end, I loved it. Overall I would love to return to Delmonico and perhaps leave room for dessert next time!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	While staying at the Palazzo in Vegas during the CES & AEE convention's I had a great dinner at Delmonico's with a few new friends on a Friday night.\nWe did not make a reservation for the 4 of us, but the maitre' d Marty put a table together for us in about a 5 min wait. The place was packed!\nI guess it's the perk of being with "high rollers" aka "corporate cocks".\nNo, but seriously we had unbelievable service thanks to Marty's personal touch & our beautiful hostess Corrine. \nOur C.C's did the pleasure of doing the ordering for us ladies. I must give my C.C's credit because these 2 men had great taste!\nWe started with a very nice bottle of Pinot Noir, Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp, Truffle Parmesan Potato Chips, Lobster Bisque, a really good salad that was not on the menu per the request of my C.C friend Richard.\nThe lobster bisque was interesting, the chef bakes the lobster into a tasty biscuit that you can dip or crumble into the creamy bisque. \nWe also had Butternut Squash Ravioli both dishes brought me back to Delmonico's for 2nd's on Sunday night. Again, I was lucky enough to have Corrine as my hostess the 2nd time around. Thanks Corrine : )\nOur main course we had a very fine bottle of Cabernet not on the wine list but one of our Maitre' d Marty's personal fav's!\nWe each had the Bone In Ribeye Steak's they were huge!! Gigantor!!! \nI ate maybe a 1/4 of it!! \nTo compliment our BIG juicy rib eyes we had Vegetables of the Day & New Orleans Creamed Spinach. D'lish!\nWe had sooo much food I thought I was going to burst!\nAll though we were all stuffed some how we managed to end our meal with some coffee & dessert's,  Emeril's Banana Cream Pie (my personal fav. FYI I love cream pies ; p) & Chocolate Peanut Butter Torte. So sinful..... but not as sinful as two women in vegas baby!! \nWhat happens in Vegas stay's in Vegas!!!\nLet's just say our date's were not cheap and our bill was not small $$$$.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Always on the hunt for the perfect steakhouse I took up some Yelp recommendations and gave this place a try. We were a party of 6 and truth be told we were running on fumes from the prior evenings festivities (how strange...in vegas??) so this review is based on our less than average appetites. Although we did order a lot more than we could manage to eat.\n\nTheir most popular steak is probably the bone in rib-eye and it's a whopping 16 ounces (without bone)...quite hefty and although the steak was cooked to perfection it was definitely under seasoned. It also seemed mine had a bit more fat than usual which is as we know is where all the flavour is but it seemed perhaps a bit too much. All the sides were awesome and their meant to be shared family style... definitely try the garlic mushrooms!\n\nService was top notch...not in your face but always there making sure your wine is topped off and full of suggestions when you need.\n\nI've been to STK in Vegas and if you're looking for the more swank place you might want to hit that up but for a more authentic steakhouse experience I'd definitely recommend Delmonico...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is my second visit to one of emeril's steakhouses. Like the chophouse I visited previously, the service and food were out of this world. It's not a cheap eat, but it's one of the best steaks you'll ever have!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I have eaten at this restaurant twice. The first meal was memorable and I never forgot it. As a result, I was so excited to go back last week. I had the truffle chips for an appetizer which were good but they didn't fit in with that kind of restaurant. My friend had a shrimp appetizer that was the favorite of the waiter's but we both found it very strange. It was supposed to be something creole and the shrimp was covered with an unattractive brown sauce. Odd.\n\nWe both had a filet mignon. I ordered mine medium rare. I couldn't finish the last 15% of it because it was rare. Disgusting. It was fine but not worth $50. It came with a  sauce that made it delicious though. Without the sauce it would have been a big disappointment.\n\nWe ordered a side of double baked potatoes. That was the best part of the meal.\n\nWe each ordered a dessert. I had the banana cream pie. It was gorgeous but it was all bananas (which I LOVE) but with little cream. It was fine. My friend had the creme brulee and it was delicious.\n\nService was very nice. Overall at $312 I won't be going back simply because it isn't worth the money.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I took my husband to LV for his 40 birthday. Thought would be nice to try this steak place since he loves steak.  I don't mind paying for good food but the steak is average, The place is nice but our table is right by the kitchen. If i mentioned is a birthday celebration when I made the reservation then at least a good table location. They made no effort to even mention "Happy Birthday" to my husband.  Joe's is much better. Never come back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	One of the most all-time memorable dining experiences I've ever had.  \n\nThough I am vegetarian now, my mouth *STILL* waters at the thought of the filet mignon I had at Delmonico's.  It was simply unrivaled by any other steak I've ever had and probably any other steak I ever will have.  I sincerely doubt that in my life I will ever -- EVER -- have a better steak.  It was perfectly cooked, and coated with the perfect amount of pepper and spices on all sides.  \n\nSecondly, but certainly not any less impressive, was the ceasar salad.  As somebody who orders ceasar salad everywhere she goes, I would venture to say that this was in the top three I've ever had -- I could probably even safely say it was the best.  Served with whole leaves, which I love, and the dressing was made at our table, right in front of our eyes.\n\nCannot be beat.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	If you are going to pay $52 dollars for the most expensive meet cut, you expect high quality meat.  Instead I got a piece of meat that was 1/3 filled with fat, fat!! Come-on this is what you expect when you are eating at a college kid barbeque party.  While my gf order the shrimp pasta and that was unbelievably oily if you are going to cook with sausage one knows hit has natural oil so you dont need to fill up the frying pan with extra oil, someone needs to question the cooks they got.  Baked oyster was alright it was tasty, but buttery and oily as well, but still flavorful.\n  The only thing good about this place is the service.  The main waiter was very helpful when choosing a cocktail.  The servers where very friendly as well.\n  Bottom line: This place can cost over $150 person, depends what and quantity of order, skip the food at this place just come for cocktails.\n\nThis place got two stars for service and cocktails.  Would have gotten four if I was describing a lounge or bar.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	WOW.\n\nI came to Vegas searching for their best steak and I think I might have found it.  The dining experience overall was spectacular.  \n\nI purposely starved myself all day and did tons of walking throughout the day so by the time we were seated at our table, I was ready to rip into it.  The only thing I eyeballed was their bone-in rib eye.  Ordered it medium rare.  The first bite was perfect.  So much flavor and it just melted in my mouth.  Not only was the food great, the service was as well!  \n\nThanks Delmonico for making my last night in Vegas dining experience a memorable one!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The meal started with Ryan greeting us and taking great care of every detail. From the Lobster Bisque and wedge salad with blue cheese crumbles to the best bone-in rib-eye in years to a great and perfectly tart key lime pie, I could not be happier.  Great meal and service!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	After reading other bad reviews I realized we are not the only ones whom this happened too. First we were charged double for the wine yes that's right a so called liquor tax that was exactly double the price\n \nSecond I noticed throughout the meal and going to the restrooms that this place is racist they put any group with colored people in this one room and white people out in the open I think another table noticed this as well. I'm clearly disgusted and won't be dinning at affiliated restaurants
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	What a wonderful food experience!!  Our waiter Ryan was perfect and treated us well. Give the Parmesan Truffle Potato chips a try, you will love them. Lobster Bisque was good as was our steaks.  Side dishes are large so split the order.  The decor is lovely and it was a nice quiet atmosphere. Wish we had room for dessert but maybe next time.  There's definitely lots of places to eat in Vegas but I have to say come to Delmonico Steakhouse. It's well worth every penny.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This was an amazing meal with wonderful service.  We ordered Filet Mignon and it was the best steak we ever had and we are from the Midwest.  Emeril knows his steak!  Husband started with the Lobster Bisque.  Best Bisque we have ever had.  Gratin potatoes were wonderful as an accompaniment for the steak!  Last we had the Emeril's Banana Cream Pie.  OMG!!!  This meal was worth every penny we spent on it.  It was incredible.  Delmonico's is a MUST DO in Las Vegas!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place is fantastic. A little pricey but worth it. Michael our waiter was spot on with service. \nI had the wilted spinach & frisée salad and the BBQ Salmon (medium). I also got the créme brûlée for desert. \nMy co-worker just got the NY Strip (well done), unfortunately it was not well done. However as soon as Michael saw that it was not cooked properly he immediately took it back and had it cooked completely. I would have not gotten a steak like that we'll-done but he's picky. When he got it back he said it was a very good steak, just wished there was more steak and less bone. \nI would definitely go back. One of the best meals I've ever had in Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Wonderful pre-show dinner!  We enjoyed the handcrafted cocktails, delicious BBQ shrimp appetizer, bowl of authentic gumbo, perfectly cooked filet mignon with cajun spices, twice cooked baked potato, and a flavorful key lime pie along with a beautiful bottle of Petit Syrah recommended by the sommelier.  The ambiance is nice, the service was impeccible and the location is wonderful!!  Would highly recommend this restaurant and will happily come again!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Been here twice for lunch (once today and once during Restaurant Week) and once for dinner a long time ago....\n\nThis review is for today's Lunch experience.\n\nSo... this place exudes Power Lunch without the Noise ambiance...Soft lighting, quiet/hush talking, white table clothes, ultra professional service, a fabulous menu and high prices.  Everyone except me was in a business suit... but like I care.  \n\nMy g-friend ordered sort of off the menu... the options were on the menu but the way she wanted it prepared was not.  They didn't even bat an eye... they just asked a couple questions to make sure they "did it right".\n\nShe got grilled salmon and steamed / lightly sauteed spinach.... and it came out perfect!  It looked fabulous.\n\nI just ordered the cobb salad.  I know... I'm boring that way.  But it was a really good cobb salad... the bacon... OH!  The bacon! on my salad was The Best!  Freshly grilled skinny strips of bacon that were juicy and meaty.  I'll order it again just for the bacon "bits".  The avocado was fresh and creamy... the blue cheese crumbles were rich and blue-cheesy.  All in all, a very nice salad.  \n\nService was very professional and attentive without being annoying. They filled our iced tea and water without us even noticing.  It was awesome.\n\nFor lunch... it's pricey ... the two of us was $52 w/o tip....but if you want a really, really nice business lunch or a lunch that is NOT noisy, crowded or typical... Go Here.\n\nI'll be back because they have Lobster Sliders on the menu now... I gotta go back to try these.  :)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Beyond food coma...it's food paralysis!  The itis ain't got nothin' on this.\n\nI had my preconceptions of the food here but I put them away for a short time and figured I'll try anything once.  Dinner started with some bread with butter and munched on the truffle and parmesan potato chips.  They were very oily, warm, crunchy, savory, and tangy in flavor.  We did not make a dent in them.  The appetizer was soon followed by the lobster bisque and traditional New Orleans gumbo with chicken and andouille sausage.  The lobster bisque was really intense in flavor.  It had an almost bitter flavor but so rich like condensed sweet buttery lobster in sea water.\n\nThe protein that night was the bone-in ribeye which we split.  Perfectly cooked to medium, it had a nice crust on the outside and had a big glob of butter on top.  I immediately scraped the butter off and put it on the side but a lot of it had already melted onto the plate or penetrated the meat.  The meat was thick, tender, juicy, had perfect grill marks on the outside, and smelled floral due to the either rosemary or thyme sprigs.  Accompanying the main dish was the seared foie gras.  Yes, I had to try the duck (or goose) liver.  It was indeed buttery, silky, melt in your mouth tender and a good sized piece at that.  Like everything else here, it was seared in butter and had a salty, buttery crust to it.\n\nAs for the sides, we had sauteed garlic wild mushrooms and the creamed corn gratinee.  The mushrooms were delightful.  I loved forking up different varieties that I had no idea what they were.  They just tasted great.  The garlicky, buttery flavor and tender yet almost slippery texture makes this dish my favorite of the night.  The creamed corn also exhibited buttery flavor so much I think it was in a bath of butter and heavy cream.\n\nYou couldn't have all this great food without wine and they have an impressive wine menu indeed.  I went with that I know and got the syrah.  Toward the end of the meal it hit me.  The wall...of carbs, butter, salt, cholesterol, all in a sluggish soup coursing though my veins like molasses.  I feel my heart straining to pump the blood with heavy thumps and I feel the arteries of my wrist bumping against the table.  My body starts to get lethargic - I don't wanna move, no I can't move - as I gaze blankly over the huge leftovers of corn and butter.  This is beyond food coma, I need a blood transfusion I thought.  Need I be more dramatic?  My preconceptions were right.\n\nOn the bright side, the service is impeccable here and everyone seems to to take their job seriously and sincerely.  It is a bit of a formal atmosphere but you don't feel like you're in Las Vegas for the short time you're there.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had the pleasure of dining at this establishment recently and have to say the food and service was above par. My Fiance got the Japanese Wagyu Ribeye steak and said it was the most delectable steak he has had the privilege of tasting. I had the Filet Mignon and it was cooked perfectly. I would definitely come back for any special event or for a great steak.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The best bone-in rib eye steak I've ever had.  I recommend getting it medium so the fatty goodness gets enough heat.\n\nThe calamari and truffle oil potato chips were also fantastic.\n\nThe service was nice and professional.\n\nThe bill was huge.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Yum.Yum.Yum\n\nCame here 4th of July weekend to celebrate my gf bday.\nWe made reservations for a party of 8. However, we arrived an hour late but they still seated us immediately. Thumbs up.\n\nI really wasn't paying attention to what everyone else was ordering so I'll just list what we got..\n\nCrab Cakes\nRib Eye Steak \nShrimp Fettucinni with Sausages\nSteamed Broccoli ($10 for a small bowl.. I really wanted to go to the Frozen isle and buy one for $1.50) haha\nOrange Zest Cheesecake (My Fav)\n\nEverything came out to $180 but this included tax and gratuity.\nThe food was delicious, especially the steak. Not overcooked\nor too much seasoning. It was just right.\nFor the pasta they serve large portions of the shrimp. Not the baby shrimp you have to go digging for.\nAh ha and the crab cake was very good! I don't deal with that imitation crab. Yuck! It was not a huge portion but enough to make me happy.\nI heart the Cheesecake! It's a must! You can definately taste the Orange zest, which makes it original for your typical strawberry..etc..etc\n\nThe service was great. Why 4 stars instead of 5? Because they wouldn't allow us to sing Happy Birthday in the restaurant.\nGeeze are there any exceptions?\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this place. Scrumdelumcious!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Not much to say that hasn't already been covered by previous reviews. Good steak (although I've had better), great rolls (freebies!) and the Tale of Two Cherries cocktail was excellent and unique.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This has definitely been the best Steak in Las Vegas that I have had yet. \n\nNot only were my date and I able to get a table last minute w/o a reservation - but our wait staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. I was given two wines to try based on my meal choice, and stuck with an Aussie Syrah that was to die for. \n\nWe were given no attitude when we told the server that we wanted to share the bone in ribeye($52) which was fab given our desire to try other menu items w/o emptying our pockets completely. \n\nStarted off with the Blue Cheese Apple Salad ($16) which had these grapes (that I originally thought were olives until I bit into them) I can only describe as being totally delicious. \n\nThen we picked the garlic sauteed mushrooms and asparagus for sides (all sides $9) The shrooms were wonderful, lots of flavor and definitely went well with the meat. The asparagus was cooked right, but I would say it lacked flavor, we had to sprinkle salt over it, and that is a downer for me at a nice restaurant. \n\nOur Bone in Rib Eye steak, which was split for us by the kitchen no questions asked, ... except for one "Who get's the bone?" "I Get the Bone!" I replied! \n\nOrdered along with a side of raw horse radish and their signature steak sauce ... The Rib Eye was cooked to perfection. I order my steak Med Rare (even though I like it bloody) because I've found in the past nicer steakhouses tend to cook on the rare side. True to form, it was cooked amazingly well. Very pink, and extremely tender. Every bite seemed to remind me of a fillet which is unusual for that cut of meat, it just melted in your mouth then, after my date made sure I wouldn't offend anyone by asking if they minded me chewing on the bone like a dog with table scraps ;) - I did just that \n\nI'd also like to mention that if you have a choice, I would ask for Todd to be your server, he was a delight to talk to, and payed us a lot of attention - which is more than I can say for the staff at Stack inside the Mirage :( \n\nOur entire bill was only $110 and we were both full and satisfied. I would go back to Delmonico's again in a heartbeat.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I was in Las Vegas with my fiancé while he was attending a wireless convention for his company.  I asked a friend to recommend a good restaurant to go to while we were there.  From his short list of about 5, we chose Delmonico's.  Delmonico's is at the Venetian in the Palazzo with about 50 other shops & restaurants.  Attire was business casual.  The dining room was dimly lit and elegant.  They treat you with table side service, and very personal attention from no less than 3 attendants.\n\nThe wine list was impressive and started out with Kevin's picks (the sommelier).  I noticed the by the glass section only had about 5 different wines on it. Apparently this wasn't a by the glass kind of place!  Their wine list also boasted many 'cult' wines like Screaming Eagle and Harlan.  Although Twomey Merlot was on the list, we soon found that they had sold out already.  Our maitre d', Lamont, said he was a very big fan and recommended it frequently.  Kevin came by our table to meet us and said he wasn't aware they were out of the Merlot and that he would be ordering more that week.\n\nDelmonico's is a classic American steakhouse with Creole influences.  I couldn't decide between the crab cake, the ahi tuna & salmon tartare & the New Orleans BBQ shrimp so our waiter suggested the shrimp; said it was their signature starter and I was so glad he did.  It was amazing! I also had the filet. It was cooked perfectly, creole seasoned, medium rare (the color was consistently the same shade through the entire cut) and it melted like butter in your mouth. The service was exquisite.  There was a maitre d' & a waiter for every 3 tables and we were given a lot of attention.  For dessert, I had chocolate brioche bread pudding with Hawaiian vintage chocolate ice cream & fudge. When our server came back to check on us, I thought maybe I had a look of sheer ecstasy on my face, but he had said he knew how good  it was and wanted to make sure I was enjoying it as much as he does.  We surprised Lamont by telling him we were leaving him wine; he thanked us for our generosity.\n\nI am giving Delmonico's 5 stars, each of which I feel they are very worthy of.  Dining here was not cheap, or even close to being on budget, ($450 for 2 people) but it was fantastic.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The misleading reviews that others wrote about this place have almost made me lose all faith in Yelp.\n\nIn short, this place is NOT worth your money. No. No. No.  Let's recap why.\n\nThe service was hit or miss. When we got there a few minutes early for a reservation, I let them know we would wait for a good table. Instead, the hostess tried to sit us at a table next to a portable cooking station and this little room where the waiters get extra plates, forks, etc. Worst seat in the house. No joke. It was after 10 p.m. on a Friday. The place WAS packed, but there were a few better tables left. Why do us like this?\n\nSo we ask for a better table. Hostess walks us all the way back out of the dining room, looks at computer, walks us all the way back into dining room, this time to sit us near the open backdoor that patrons use to go to the bathroom and the waitstaff uses to hide in in between orders. It's January. So clearly this is a great idea. NOT.\n\nI was so angry I almost walked out right then. I could understand if it was 8 p.m. and those free, better tables were being saved for someone. But it was late. We were the last customers of the night. Give us the best, free table, you idiot!\n\nAnyhizzle, our waiter shows up and man is amazing. He reads us the whole menu, which usually I hate, but he was so charming, it was OK.  Loved him. Best part of the entire night.\n\nSo they start us with a complimentary  amuse-bouche, which was declicious. So second best part of the night. And that basically concludes are positives.\n\nThe bread was so boring I thought it was running for office. \n\nMy wine tasted as if the bottle had been opened the week before. When I complained ONLY because I was asked if I liked it, the amazing waiter brought me two other wines to try. Im telling you, best waiter ever. But the wines all tasted rancid. I didn't tell him this because I didn't want to be a jerk, so I just sipped happily cuz it is Vegas and the point is to drink, OK?\n\nWe started with the lobster bisque (I've tasted better lobster broth at Whole Foods and the lobster was hard) and a mushy tomato salad.\n\n Then we shared some crazy 32-ounce ribeye that came with a puff pastry and bone marrow. I love marrow, but this was gross. And the ribeye had no taste at all. No salt. No pepper. Just grease. Where's the BAM, Emeril? Also, the steak was so hard and not medium rare, as we ordered it. \n\nThe waiter recommended the potatoes gratin. Dude, I've made better gratin drunk. The potatoes were still hard and it tasted like pure garlic. I love garlic, but this was like Buffy the Vampire Slayer killing a villian garlic. \n\nSo we left. The check wasn't bad for Vegas. \n\nBut for a special night out? Not worth your time.\n\nI like StripSteak at Mandalay so much more. While it does have THE shittiest service, the steaks are like butter and the sides are to die for.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	As a restaurant under Emeril Lagasse's name, I was expecting a consistent, quality meal.  Instead, I left very disapointed with the restaurant.  The only highlight was the signature BBQ shrimp appetizer.  The butternut squash raviolis with duck confit were unexplainably dry.  The shredded duck on top should be slightly dry or crispy, but the inside of the raviolis shouldn't be.  I don't know if I could even say the butternut squash was pasty.  So dry it was bordering on gritty.   \n\nThe truffle parmesan potato chips were cut ultra thin and so tasty, but were dripping with too much oil.  Instead of tasting light and airy, they felt weighed down by goopy oil drops that clung to each chip.  \n\nThen there's the steak.  We ordered one bone in ribeye and a standard ribeye.  Both cuts were juicy, marbled nicely and cooked to the right levels, except for one thing, the steak had no taste.  What creates the taste, seasoning and aging?  Well, whatever it was, it was only surface deep.  the outer portion of the steak was seasoned, but the meat in the middle really had no taste.  Even the butter scoop that topped the steak couldn't make a noticeable difference.    \n\nDon't get me wrong, the meat quality was good, but if I pay $50 for a steak, I expect flavor.  It felt like I was eating a $25 steak.   I almost wanted to ask them for bernaise sauce to get me through it.  Even though the wait staff was extremely helpful and attentive, it couldn't save this disappointing meal.   \n\nIn Vegas the only other steakhouse I've been to is N9ne at the Palms and I would recommend that over Delmonico's in a heartbeat.   I don't think I'll be going back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I rarely write reviews, even though I rely on Yelp VERY heavily for my restaurant selections! It's usually just because nothing overwhelmed me, or I was too lazy to do so - I'm trying to be better about that! My husband and I went to Las Vegas last week for our first year anniversary to get a way for a few days. We always try and scout out new restaurants. This was definitely our favorite meal - hands down! The entire experience was great -- they brought out a small treat for us to start, then we both had amazing bourbon cocktails, and then dove into the delicious food. I got the Filet Mignon, but prepared Piedmontese style which is just seasoning, olive oil, roasted garlic, and rosemary - it was cooked perfectly (medium) and super tender and had great flavoring. It didn't need any sauce! My husband got the bone-in ribeye which they are known for I believe - I had a few bites and it was fantastic. The au gratin potatoes were also good and not overly heavy like some can be. Our wine was great as well, Stag's Leap. The BEST part of the experience though was our waiter Rene. He was so attentive, fun to talk to, and just wanted us to enjoy ourselves. He really made this experience special. I also have some dietary restrictions and I've never seen a restaurant be so attentive to them. It really put me at ease. Next time you're in Vegas, GO HERE. We'll be returning for New Year's this year and have already recommended it to some friends going out later this month!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	First off I love Emeril I think his food is old school and sloppy, but I love him and don't doubt his food is delicous! So I was excited to go there. I am a chef, and a succesful one I've ran restaurants and now I am a private chef, so I know food and service! I was with my girlfriend and another couple, from the start we were treated like we didn't belong there. They forgot to bring us our wine for like 20 minutes. The table beside us arrived after us and recieved their wine and food before us! They recieved excellent service, getting a amuse bouch, and all served at the same time! We were treated like dishwashers. I thought the food was ok, crabcake was decent but lacked simple seasoning salt and pepper! I thought they would at least make there own bread, but no. The ribeyes were charred black and had no seasoning, filet was ok but lacked seasoning. Gnocchi was great but a little salty. All in all food lacked seasoning, waiter was a asshole, all though the manager was cool I will never step foot in there again!!!!!!!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The best steakhouse I have ever been too!!! I had the filet and it was soooo good! So tender. My hubby had the bone in ribeye and he said that it was the best steak he has ever had. Definitly a must try when in Vegas.\nProbably will be going again and again ever time we visit Las Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Thanksgiving dinner with the family,  ok food but better can be had for the price.\n\nGoing in,  you expect good service ( check), nice atmosphere (check), and good food (mostly check).  At $14 for soups and $62 for a steak ( including $12 for peppercorn sauce).  You get it here.\n\nA couple of issues. Delmonico's is branded as a premier Steakhouse priced accordingly.  Nothing about my meal and / or my service deserved a premier rating.  My steak was ok at best.  The Peppercorn sauce lacked any sort of consistency and flavor.  My Wife's turkey was good... but that was expected given day.\n\nService was attentive and not overbearing. They accommodated our kids ( mostly stuck to their Kindles all evening... thank you Amazon!)    but were slow to react to most simple requests ( again, could be thanksgiving though we were there early).\n\nNet,  after spending a significant amount on a special dinner... nothing rings special!\n\nI expected more and it delivered a sub par experience for a Premier establishment.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The wife wanted to go to a celebrity chef restaurant so I decided on this place from a past good experience. We had a real good time. \n\n I had the Pisco Sour as my cocktail, the petite lettuce wedges, filet and mash potatoes. All where freak'n delicious! \n\nMy wife still talks about the filet at this place.You cannot go wrong with this place unless you are vegetarian.\n\nAnother great place at the Venetian is Bouchon.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I was over here for dinner the other night.  It took a while to get seated on a busy Saturday night, so we hung out at the lounge for a bit.  Once we were seated though, the service was pretty good, as well as the setting.  It was too loud as far as ambiance goes, but it wasn't too invasive.  \n\nWe grabbed the Stuffed Pork Trotter, which by itself could be an entree as opposed to the appetizer.  After we were "stuffed" with the pork trotter, we proceeded on to the main course.  I grabbed the boneless rib-eye, which was very intimidating.  I also shared some sides of spinach and mashed potatoes.  All of the main entree items were excellent, though I was too full to finish the rib-eye.\n\nThis place is probably one of the better steakhouses I've been to in a long while, despite the prices, which I was fine with paying.  Bring an empty stomach, but a full wallet.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We came here for our one year anniversary dinner.   I was a little intimidated to eat at a place like this in Vegas but once we were seated everyone was super nice and didn't make us feel like we shouldn't be there.   \n\nThe menu has a bunch of different things on it but the star of the show (as told by my waitress) is the beef.   Husband and I knew we were both going to order steak before we even looked at the menu.   \n\nI ordered the ribeye with country smashed potatoes and husband got the filet mignon with creamed corn.   The side were served family style and were more than enough for two people.   The creamed corn was fantastic.  It had little bits of jalapeno in it for the extra BAM!  \n\nWe both ordered the lobster bisque to start.   Bisque was very delicious especially the lumps of lobster meat.   Did you know during the summer the bisque is dairy free?  \n\nThe steaks were just okay.  Asked for mine medium but it came out well done so I didn't find it that good.  Husband also asked for medium but basically got a rare steak.   \n\nOverall though the atmosphere was definitely upscale yet comfortable.  I want to compliment our waitress ...she was very friendly and fun.   Check was $164 dollars for two people.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great restaurant! The people were extremely kind and the food was excellent. Thanks to the Indianapolis Colts beating the Chiefs, house money paid the bill but I'd be more than happy to spend my "hard earned" cash here as well!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Disappointing or too high of expectations? \n\nWhen I am spending $50 for a steak (Bone-in Ribeye) which was recommended by the waiter was the best steak on the menu I have particularly high expectations. The dishes are all a la carte so I also ordered a side of Asparagus, Potatoes AuGratin and Garlic Mushrooms. \n\nThe steak was a large serving (14 oz) but I found it lacked in flavor for my expectations. I have had better steak at high end restaurants....
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Me and my wife have been here 4 years in a row for our anniversary. Last nite was simply incredible. Best steak of my life.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Just one word people " FABULOUS" !!!!!! \n\nIt was my first time eating in one of Emeril's restaurants and I'm so happy to say it definitely lived up to all the hype. The food Omg the food was mouth watering I ordered the bbq salmon which was to die for it had diced potatoes and chorizo (I think) The salmon was glazed with bbq sauce and was the best salmon I ever had it was finger liking good and my hubby ordered the bone in rib eye which he loved and for our side we order the grilled asparagus and twice baked potato. The food and service were superb. Next time I'm in Vegas I'm definitely going back !!!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Started out with a rude front desk manager who was too busy to pay attention that we were there. Finally the girl who was working the desk came over to take care of us. Service at the table was overkill. Too many different people trying to take care of us. Prices were high but that is expected so no big deal. Steaks were overcooked. That is poor for a steak house like this one. Sent them back. Manager did not even have the decensy to visit the table to attend to the problem.   First time there and with all the other great places to eat it will be the last. Don't waste your time.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	They have a barely manageable lunch menu, but their dinner menu and wine list is great.\n\nI love RIb Eye's everywhere, so I tried to go for the New York Strip, it was just ok.  Fortunately, I tried my friend's rib-eye and it was as expected, quite good.  Their sides are all above par, but make sure you look through their wine list - you will find a few gems in them!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The man has done it again!: On a recent trip to Vegas our casino host suggested we dine at the Delmonico for a nice steak in a fabulous environment. WOW! The atmosphere was cool & hip but not fake or stuffy as sometimes happens in upscale establishments. It was romantic & relaxed. We felt right at home. The service was top notch....friendly & efficient as one would hope. Our servers were always a nod away & ready to tend to all of our needs. The meal was simply fantastic. Our salads were crisp & fresh. We ordered the Chateaubriand for two & were blown away at the quality of beef & flavor. A nice touch was the final searing & butterfly filleting table side. Coffee was good. Dessert was shared as no room was left after the meal. We enjoyed every savory bite. The whole dinning experience has been one of our favorites to date.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The lamb is delicious! The atmosphere is wonderful and the service is excellent!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A lovely date spot but otherwise I'd worry it feels slightly too formal/buttoned up for my ideal night out in Vegas - food was pleasant, wait staff was really pro and the banana cream pie is the best I have ever had by a mile
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	By FAR one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  I have eaten here many times for dinner and was able to have lunch as well.  Lunch was just as good and less expensive here as dinner.  What I love most about this place is the variety on the menu.  It is all typical steakhouse fare but with lots of choices and executed very well.  The typical blue cheese wedge is so decadent with large chunks of cheese and caramelized bacon, all other wedge salads will not do it for you in the future.  The lobster bisque is sweet and creamy and is a must have each time you go.  \n\nImportant hint: don't pass up dessert - a true quality restaurant will have a well rounded and exciting dessert menu.  Delmonico's never fails.  My favorite is anything chocolate/peanut butter or Baily's Irish cream inspired.  This restaurant always seems to have something like this on their menu.  Desserts are rich, gooey with a multitude of flavor combos.  Just what I like :)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This was an experience meal, and totally the right choice for my 30th birthday dinner.\n\nThe service was special. Lots of attention to detail, and I left feeling spoiled.\n\nI had the bone-in ribeye, and it was a serious steak. I cook a dry-aged steak from my local butcher pretty well. I'll satisfy any friend of mine with that, and I'm always happy with my work. This steak was just long beyond anything I could have made. Great quality meat, wonderful seasoning, perfect crust, cooked to perfect medium rare.\n\nTheir special Mai Tai is really, really good. If you want an appetizer, the heirloom tomato salad we had was amazing, drizzled with balsamic, oil, and mozzarella. Also really enjoyed the parmesan truffle oil chips that our friends ordered.\n\nExpensive, but one of the few meals I've had that can justify this kind of price.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We decided to give Delmonico's a try because we had received a special notification through American Express. I had been to Delmonico's in New Orleans many years ago and my Hubby and I frequented Emeril's in Orlando when we lived in Tampa. We were not disappointed!! I had requested a romantic booth and that's exactly where we were seated!! This experience was wonderful and memorable! For starters, our wait staff was Amazing! Kudos to Mark, Dan and Tyke. We started with the Carpaccio and Green Salad - both fresh and delicious! I ordered a special Ribeye that was not on the menu that Mark told me about. Divine! Hubby got the Japanese Waygu and said it was the most tender Ribeye he had ever eaten! For wine, we opted for a 1/2 bottle of a 2007 Chateauneuf-du-Pape that was perfect for our entrees. For dessert, we got the Chocolate Decadence Cake that was delicious! The only negative was the Pistachio Ice Cream had shells in the first bite. The Manager was summoned and the dessert was taken off the bill and he offered us the choice of another dessert which we declined. Overall, a wonderful dining experience and we would gladly return!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The best steak I ever had in Vegas!! I have been here three times and they have never disappointed. Every steak I have had has been perfectly cooked and seasoned. Caesar salad was perfect and the sides were tasty as well. Service is always friendly and ambiance is nice. With many choices, Emeril never seems to disappoint  and I'm truly a fan.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Came here with my family and we had a great experience! Service was timely and very welcoming and every dish that came out was excellent. They have a great wine and cocktail list. To start, we got the seafood tower- lobster, oysters, shrimp, crab legs, tuna tartare YUM. All the seafood came on ice so I would recommend that you let it sit on your plate a couple minutes before eating. We also got the bone in rib eye which was cooked to perfection and huge! The chocolate cake and pistachio ice cream was a great way to end the meal. Definitely a pricey steakhouse but worth every dollar.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant while I was visiting Vegas with my fiance. We were staying at the Venetian and this location is conveniently located within the beautiful hotel so it was an easy choice for dinner. It is definitely nice not having to step outside of the AC when the average temperature outside is 115! \n\nI got the caesar salad to start and filet mignon for the main dish. Some of the side items we got were spinach, asparagus, wild mushrooms, and creamed corn gratinee. The main dishes do not come with sides so they are extra but the portions are large enough to share. \n\nI asked for my filet mignon to be medium rare and it was done perfectly. The steak was so tender and delicious! It was definitely one of the best steaks I have had. The sides complimented the meat nicely and everything single one of them were delicious. I wish I could comment on their deserts but we were both so full by the end of the meal that we decided to skip desert. This restaurant is a must if you are in Vegas!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I came here with HIGH expectations, and Delmonico's did not disappoint. \n\nEach steak ran between $45-55 a la carte, which isn't that extraordinary considering it was a Saturday night in Las Vegas. \n\nI had the bone-in rib eye, which was HUGE. Sadly, I couldn't finish it, which is pretty extraordinary for me. We all ordered several sides (potato gratin, asparagus, baked potatoes, etc), each of which cost $9. \n\nAside from the monstrously huge (and tasty!) portions, I think the most memorable feature of Delmonico's was the ambiance and atmosphere. The staff is incredibly helpful, and ensure an enjoyable experience overall. \n\nDon't miss out!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My friend told me about this place - really liked it. The bone in ribeye was great. Loved the creamed corn too.\n\nMy heart does belong to the NYC Strip House, but I would go back to here if I were in Vegas again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Love, Love, Love Delmonico's.\nMy husband and I eat here every time we visit Vegas.  The service has always been consistently great-call you by name, never a water glass left half full, and servers who know and understand the menu.  The food, well, that's what really keeps us going back.  Last visit, we had the Chateaubriand for 2-it was perfect.  The sides that came with were delicious and we had the beer/cheese dip with pretzel bread for a starter and it was heaven in a bowl.  I like the wine selection-our server paired our steak with an appropriate red-not too full, but not too sweet , either.  I also love that they've always sent out an amuse-bouche(a nice, little bite) from the chef before you order-it's the little things that add up!\nEmeril-you've done it right again!\nWe're going to actually try Carnevino, Batali's latest,  on our trip next month for something new, but I know we'll always visit Delmonico's!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	probably the best steak ive had in my life yet.\n\nfirst and foremost it is a steakhouse.  so you can go ahead and eat whatever else is on the menu, but if you come to this spot without ever trying their steak youre a foolio.\nive been here several times now and each time my experience is stellar on the social and epicurious level.  good service, fantastic food, youre in vegas, what else do you want? (i guess winning jackpot at the casino would round it off nicely, but thats a whole 'nother story :)\n\nanyway, so in my opinion, dont even bother with the filet mignon, that cut is way over rated, which fancy pants rich people have turned into this "exclusive" non weight bearing tender cut of bovine that the social elite should be eating.  while, all of the tenderness story is true, the flavor is all in the bone in ribeye.  this place uses usda prime aged cut, which is the best you can get.  and get it bone in, the bones give off more flavor in the cooking process.  another sign of a good steak house is if its served with butter, which not every place does, but i personally think makes the meat taste 10x better.\n\none other thing i did like about this place is their dinner rolls served to everyone at the beginning of your dinner.  ya ya, dinner rolls, so what.  well, it was actually fresh here.  freshly made, warm, with a little bit of salt on it.  its like being at an awesome steakhouse that has a pan del sal bakery in it!  all in all, it's great food, great service, good location, being in between the palazzo and venetian, thats all you need.  just make sure you bring money, cause this place is on the pricey side, but have no fear, you will get your money's worth!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Always reliable, like you old Ramington 870.\nGreat service, outstanding wine list. \nSkip the appetizers and go for a streak and salads
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We were served chicken skewers, prosciutto, and potstickers for appetizers. They were all delicious! \n\nNext we were served a delicious light salad! \nI was never disappointed by the service or food! Truly a five star restaurant
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place is excellent.  I would highly recommend it for steak.  I ordered the NY.  I ordered medium rare, but it came out overcooked to a medium well.... I would have complained and asked for another one, had the steak not been so effin' delicious.\n\neven though it was over cooked, by my taste, it still ranked on my top steaks that i've eaten.  that's got to say something.  But I will say that in my groups of 10 friends, the majority of them got their steaks exactly how they ordered it.\n\nThe sides are good.  The fresh buns they serve are fantastic.  and they do supply some sauces with the steaks, but man... you just don't want to spoil the taste of these awesome steaks.\n\nThis place is pricey, but it's worth it.  they have a great wine selection.  50 page/chaptered wine book selected by their own somoliere.\n \nI'm going back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	In a city with overrated 'celebrity' steakhouses, Delmonico was a breath of fresh air. Impeccable service, delicious salads, and unbelievably delicious steak (we got the bone-in ribeye, creamed spinach, and garlic mushrooms). Definitely will be coming back the next time we're in town.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This was an excellent experience from the front desk to the last bite of dessert.\nThe appetizers that we ordered from the nightly specials menu were creative and delicious. The steaks were perfectly cooked and excellent quality. I didn't love the seasonal onions but they were as described and just not cooked to my taste. The desserts were excellent, the creme brulee was perfect. I loved the list of espressos and enjoyed topping off my meal with one.\nThe wine list had moderately priced items and the staff were extremely helpful without being fussy. \nThis was a great experience and I highly recommend it!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Pretty pricey, but the food is good. Tried escargot for the first time here, and I was impressed. It is an OK place to eat alone, but would be better with a special someone. Nice atmosphere.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Pricey, but worth it. I tried the pan roasted salmon with sweet corn &  crab vinaigrette and fresh basil- of coarse with mashed potatoes :), the Cesar salad and a shared Apple Fritter desert with pecan pie.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2 stars for the great service!\n\n- 3 stars for all the food...\n\nThe bone in ribeye was bland and overcooked.\nThe lobster was really chewy and fishy smelling...\nThe foie gras was good but I mean when is the liver of an specially fattened duck not good? \n\nFor the $$$$ we spent I just expected so much more! \n\nYelp...you let me down!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Before you digest any of my review it is important to say that I travel to Vegas on business and I find that with very few exceptions the restaurants, even the nice ones, to be poor imitations of what one would find in a city that hasn't been painted into existence.\n\nNonetheless, the steak I had at Delmonico was excellent and the service refreshing by Vegas standards.  The table-side Caesar salad preparation makes for good show and equally excellent taste.  It's not the quietest or the most interesting interior design, very basic and elegant if perhaps a bit crowded.  If you want a nicely cooked piece of quality meat only slightly on the spendy side this is a recommended option.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I liked this place better than Elmer, but then again he ordered a "special of the day", so I think he's right in expecting something pretty good in a restaurant that's presenting itself as elegant.\n\nThe waiting bar was okay but dead.  The seats are nice but some tables get way too close to each other.  \n\nThe calamari was very disappointing.  The warm spinach salad was really tasty.\n\nI had the BBQ samon - it was flavorful, tender, juicy and overpriced.\n\nIf I had to eat there again, I'd probably just get a steak of some sort.  On my own, I wouldn't go back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	OHH.... ohhhhhhh.... omg. \n\nLet me start off by saying that I am not a beef person. I can happily chicken every day... buuut every now and then I get that naughty craving for some good ol' American red meat! :D\n\nSo ex-roomie and I went to Vegas to visit friends of hers and I told her we could do whatever they wanted & all I wanted in return was to visit one of the famous pricey Vegas steakhouses. All agreed and so we booked a reserv. for Delmonico. \n\nThe decor was simple, but elegant... kinda mod, imho. Looked very exclusive from the outside, so I felt all fancy. :D\n\nI have to give MAJOR props to the waiters(s), especially an awesome young gentleman who was a total sweetheart (I think his name was Andre..). Actually, I was shellshocked at the great service... most pricey restaurants are pretty snooty, but the peeps @ Delmonico were warm and super attentive.\n\nUnfortunately, there was major drama @ my table with a couple of the girls (snide remarks,  tears, running to the bathrooms), throughout which Andre (?) remained patient. I tuned all this out because................................\n\n..... I WAS HAVING MINI MOMENTS OVER MY AMAZING, TENDER, SUCCULENT AND DELICIOUS BONE-IN RIBEYE!!!  holy mother. The thing was huge and ex-roomie and I actually shared it (with Andre sweetly saying that it was not a problem) and it was STILL too much. Had my steak been anything but spectacular, I would have been mortified at the shenanigans. Instead, I swiped some artichoke spears (crisp, fresh and awesome) & truffle potato chips (a little greasy but OMG, so good)  from the other ladies and dug into the side we ordered, which was the potato au gratin (again, a little heavy but OHHH... so amazingly tasty... my favorite side dish!) \n\nCrazy delicious food, beautiful ambiance and wonderful service, and actually, with the magic of sharing, did not break the bank. I will definitely be back!!!!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is not the Delmonicos restaurant of NY. This is an Emeril Lagasse steakhouse. There is no decoration to speak of. Just a large open room with many tables and many people chatting and laughing. We ordered the bone-in ribeye and it was prepared to perfection, but a tad bit too salty for my friend's taste. I loved mine, but you need to be a full-on caveman to eat the whole damn thing. We had the creamed spinach which was coarse and tough to chew and the au gratin potatoes were really good. The sommelier was great and recommended a very nice blend. We were so stuffed, we chose not to have dessert, but they looked quite good. This is a very nice, fancy steakhouse, but CUT still gets my vote for the best one around.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The delmonico was delicious, the potatoes were excellent, and the deserts were amazing.  After dinner I was thinking about dessert and they suggested the banana cream pie.  Normally banana cream is not my favorite, so I was somewhat skeptical, but the server said that if I did not like it they would not charge me for it. so I gave it a try.  It was amazing, I would recommend it to anyone, but you can get it at any Emeril restaurant so dont go here just for that.  Overall pricy, but very good.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Fabulous! This place will not disappoint. I had the special which was wild caught salmon. I have never tasted salmon so delicious.My husband had the steak and he said it was the best $50 he ever spent on food. We hope to visit again next year.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Absolutely fantastic service, fantastic food, and wonderful atmosphere!  We will be back, without a doubt!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I am of cajun decent and HAD to try Emeril's gumbo.  It wasn't "mom's", but it was excellent gumbo for Las Vegas.  It was a darker roux and rich.\nEveryone had steaks which were perfectly cooked and had an amazing, salty, flavorful seasoning.  The Lobster Bisque was one of the top bisque's we've ever tried!\nAlso had to try banana's foster which we highly recommend!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place was really great.  There was no wait when my girlfriend and i went here, we have reservations anyway.  We never really had to wait long for anything because we had 3 waiters helping us.  They had really good bread to start off with and they made the best tasting whisky sour i've ever had from their bar.  I got the new york strip steak and it filled me up and tasted great.  it was a very quiet place too, most of the people there were older and drinking wine.  i'd go back if i ran into a lot of money, but i'm content with $12 steak.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Lousy steak. \n\nThe service was great - Todd, Jennifer, and Nicole were very attentive and personable. Our biggest complaint was the food. The heirloom tomato salad was good which isn't saying much, but the steak was underwhelming.  The rack of lamb was probably the best dish we ordered, despite being a steakhouse. \n\nWe ordered two bone in rib eyes, a bone in New York strip, and a rack of lamb. The steaks were under seasoned and lacked that beefy flavor you'd expect from a steak.  We were told that the steaks were wet aged then dry aged, but couldn't taste any of that nuttiness that comes from dry aging. The meat was tender, but didn't have much else going for it. \n\nWe've eaten a handful of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants before, but this one really missed the mark.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I was able to sample many menu items on my first and only visit to Delmonico's to date.   The things I loved were the Parmesan chip appetizer, the caesar salad, the soft shell crab and the BBQ shrimp app.  The Caesar salad was probably the best I've ever had.  The chips were thin cut and perfectly crispy.  The BBQ shrimps were cooked just right and the bbq sauce was mild and great for the shrimp.  The crab was excellent - perfectly cooked and had great flavor. I also tried the NY strip, it was cooked correctly and had a nice crust.  It was not the best steak I've ever had, but you can tell it was done with care and quality.  The appetizers were very good because each one had something that made it special...I would like to see that with the steaks as well.  I would say the service is what i was most disappointed in.  Not that it was bad, but it just wasn't what you expect from a place of this caliber (and price).
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	WOW! Had no idea this place was this good!!! Had some surf and turf and it was excellent! great service and very easy to get to from the Convention Center.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Couldn't possibly begin to describe the incredible everything about this restaurant.  It is not for the cheque shy but the service was excellent and the food was better.  Don't skip the crazy expensive but devine Cesar salad; sounds silly even as I add to my review.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We went here for lunch during a conference held at the Venetian.  We made reservations for 5, but did not need them on a Friday around lunch time.  The wait staff was friendly and very attentive to our needs.  I started with the gumbo.  At first it had a burnt taste, which seemed to go away as I ate more of the dish.  I had the chopped salad for lunch, which was huge and had lot of everything in it.  I'm not sure if there is a separate lunch menu from the dinner menu, but I did find out bill quite pricey considering it was for lunch and no one had a steak!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had a business lunch here with a few folks - very important meeting and they took great care of us. Like most places in the big hotels on the Strip, the service was impeccable. I had the fried chicken and black eye peas, very tasty. Not sure I'd go here if it wasn't a business meal, but overall I was impressed.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Came here on vacation after a four hour drive from Los Angeles. We didn't change out of our road trip clothes but there was no judgement. The servers were always around and very friendly. The bread was amazing, never had one exactly like it before. We started with the truffle chips which were amazing! The chips aren't 100% evenly cooked/flavored but they were totally worth taking the leftovers to our hotel room. They didn't get all soggy the next day. For my meal we had the lobster sliders. When I took a bite it was something I didn't except at all but it was still delicious. LOTS of lobster meat as well. The bread is warm but the meat is cool and it blends well together instead of clashing. We were too full after that but would love to come back and try some more items.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I been here prob 5x let me tell you this is the BEST in Vegas they really knows how to cook their steak\nService is great they really want to make you happy \nHowever the sides is just ok nothing to write home about
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Really disappointed by the food.  I've been to several of Emerile's places and this one is not up to par.  I should have left when I saw the stained carpet in the bar and had to clean off the seat at my table.  My cold lobster salad was rubbery,  My fried chicken and waffles were so sweet I couldn't eat them.  Very sad to see this place so run down
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	What kind of retard spends $60 on a steak? \n\n^^^ This kind (noob.yelp.com)\n\n             \nThis place is SOOOOOOOOOO good. I have nothing negative to say whatsoever about the food. The restaurant design/ambiance is on point and so are the waiters/waitresses. I like their waiting room (piano, drinks, seats, TVs, and all). \n\nSeriously though, I could eat their steak for breakfast, lunch, dinner, AND dessert. That good. Trust.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Celebrated Labor Day weekend in Vegas and was looking for a good steakhouse. This place was high quality and great service. I ordered the salmon but substituted the potato and andouille sausage hash for mashed potatoes since I don't eat red meat or pork, and held off of the homemade Worcestershire sauce. The onion rings on the top were delicious, I could have eaten a plate of them! My boyfriend got the bone in rib eye and my friends ordered the Caesar salad for two (kinda pricey ~$34 - but good) and a steak and salmon. This will be one of my top restaurants I'll be going to when I go back to Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I don't think I could have found a more perfect place to celebrate my birthday! \n\nAfter an amazing experience in December, I was so pleased to hear we would be going back for my birthday! I decided that this time around I would try out something besides steak. I knew they had steak down pat, but if this were truly an Emeril place, I knew I had to check out the other menu selections. So this time around we enjoyed the artisanal cheeses to start and I had the shrimp with fettuccini with olive oil. My husband enjoyed a trio of filet mignon medallions. The pasta was perfectly cooked, not overly dressed in sauce with the shrimp cooked to exactly the right temperature.  My husband's filets were also perfectly done and the sauces that adorned the medalions were amazing. Truly amazing. We shared the potatoes au gratin and of course, these were just as heavenly as I remembered from our first visit. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the chocolate root beer float. The root beer was Abita, made in Louisiana. It was mild in flavor yet refreshingly delicious. I could swear that the chocolate ice cream was house made though I don't know that for a fact. It was sooooo refreshing and just the right way to top off our meal.\n\nI love Delmonico. It is by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I can't wait to go back. One day I hope to meet Emeril and hug him for making such wonderful food.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Last time I ate at this fine establishment, I uttered the words, "This is the best meal of my life."  I got this Linguine with pesto, chicken and pine nuts (yes I know, I ordered pasta at a steakhouse), but it was well worth it!  Emeril knows what he's doing no matter what the dish you order.  \n\nTheir tartar is absolutely fantastic as well. \n\nService is unlike nothing I've ever experienced.  Even though it's pricey and fancy, even if you can get here just once in your life, it's worth it!!!\n\nPS - Good beers and wines!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My experience at Delmonico was fabulous in every way. Service (especially with my large group) was superb. My last visit was my second time dining here. I must say, both of my visits have been an outstanding five-star dining extravaganza. \n\nThe restaurant was bustling for the Global Gaming Expo this past fall. We had reservations and were seated right away at a large table to accommodate our group of 9 guests. We were seated off the main dining room in a dimply lit secluded area that helped enhanced conversation and provided a more intimate dining experience. \n\nWe were promptly served our craft cocktails and wine as we browsed the menu for our dinner options. We all had a really tough time deciding on the dishes since everything looked and sounded incredible. Out waitress was on top of her game and cheerfully provided her recommendations to the group.  We ended up ordering a mix of entrees/ sides/ starters/ cocktails/ wine and sweets including a handful of Bone-In Rib-eyes (check out the photo- holy guacamole..) Bone-In NY Strips, Twice Baked Potatoes, Asparagus, Wild Mushrooms, Potato Au Gratin, Lobster Bisque, Wedge Salads with blue cheese crumbles, Banana Cream Pie, and coffee to top it off. \n\nMy guests and I were blown away by the food and service experience. Our favorite dish of the night was, you guessed it, the Bone-In Rib-eye steaks. They were seasoned perfectly with an awesome rub with hints of Cajun inspiration and topped with dab of butter. Yum. It is the best steak I've had to date. Simply divine! \n\nThe sides were large and intended to be shared and passed. We enjoyed the classic steak and potato combos and broke it up with some mixed green salads, asparagus and mushrooms. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted heavenly. We stuffed ourselves in a Thanksgiving fashion and had a wonderful and memorable evening. \n\nI will undoubtedly be returning for another amazing experience in the future! Kudos to the entire staff for making this an amazing dining experience!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	i stumbled apon this place my first trip to vegas and been coming back ever since. u can always count on getting a very good meal with some great service.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Steakhouses are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas- every resort has one, and with a few exceptions, they're generally pretty good. \n\nMy experience at Delmonico was one of those exceptions.  Three of us celebrating St Patrick's Day, March Madness, and 40th birthdays all rolled into one weekend, decided to enjoy a dinner at Delmonico's.  \n\nFrom the moment we checked in, fantastic service.  Our server, Michael, was gracious, professional, funny, and more than willing to tolerate and participate in our banter, but never in an obtrusive way.  The food was outstanding- the ribeye was perfectly cooked, and the creamed corn gratin was downright amazing. \n\nGreat wine selection, excellent service (have I mentioned the service), and a great pecan pie with some glasses of port.  This was a great dinner, and an experience I will appreciate for a long time, and worth every penny of the $200 per head that we paid.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Stopped in for lunch on 3-14 which was also restaurant week.\n\nFor starters we ordered the vine ripened heirloom tomatoes salad for her and I got the roasted heirloom tomato soup and grilled ricotta cheese sandwich. Feeling a little under see the weather the soup was a welcome relief for my scratchy throat.\n\nOur next course consisted of pan roasted Atlantic salmon for her and butternut squash ravioli in brown butter sauce for me. The raviolis were creamy and delicious.\n\nLast course we ordered the bourbon brioche bread pudding and emerils banana cream pie. Bread pudding was amazing and the cream pie wasn't half bad either. \n\nAll in all it was a very good lunch just wish I wouldn't have been sick.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I have been taken here begrudgingly a few times now and have left with the same sensation of being overstuffed with average meat or poultry and starch.  The restaurant itself is not aesthetically appealing(drab lighting with white painted walls) and seating is not very private as the proximity of the tables are annoying.  I think the branding by Emeril has had a national appeal that people identify with and that's how his restaurants do so well but personally, I think all of his restaurant's food is mediocre at best with the exception of Commander's Palace in New Orleans.  Now don't get me totally wrong, the food isn't terrible as I still give this 3 stars but the whole experience here just won't knock your socks off.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've been here twice so far and I'd have to say the first experience was the best even though they burned my steak.  Be aware that due to the way they cook their steaks you probably don't want anything over medium.  My GF hates raw meat so we ordered medium well and got a black looking steak.  I did complain and was told it was due to the way the prepare the steaks.  They did comp the steak which made things better.  I'm an appetizer man so I ordered several appetizers.  They were all excellent especially the Fois Gras dish.  \n\nWhat made my second experience less memorable?  MENU CHANGES!  Even though I knew how to order my steak perfectly now, they changed the appetizer menu on me.  They no longer offer ANY Fois Gras!!!  I asked the reason for this and was told they had people protesting about the item so they discontinued it.  I was so looking forward to it that it ruined my whole night.  I sub'd the Fois Gras with the Truffle Oil Home Made Potato chips and those are probably the best chips you'll ever have.  Desserts must not have been good because I don't even remember what I had.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Why not 5 stars?  Because even though the food was amazing, I think it was a little too pricey for what they offer.  I was there for a work dinner, and I didn't have to pay for it.. but I sure feel sorry for our vendor that did.  It was a very expensive meal for the 5 of us. \n\nDon't get me wrong.  I had the BEST (sorry Tam o Shanter) steak I've ever put in my mouth here.  I got the bone OUT rib eye, covered with melty bleu cheese chunks.  I ate the whole thing by myself, which I thought was pretty impressive, because I've never even SEEN a piece of meat that big in my whole life.  Let alone that big on a plate to eat. But size aside, the steak knife almost literally fell through the steak once you started the cut.  I always thought the metaphor of red meat melting in your mouth was a little dramatic, but it really happened.  Repeatedly.  So delicious.\n\nWe also had the BBQ Shrimp appetizer, which wasn't what I expected BBQ Shrimp to be, but still really amazing.  It wasn't actually BBQ'd I don't think, but cooked and covered in BBQ sauce that was really tasty.  Not too smokey, not too tangy, not too sweet.  Just enough BAM!  OMG I'm sorry, I had to do it.\n\nI found the creamed spinach to be a little bland and lacking, which was disappointing, because the creamed spinach I had the day before at The Palm was fantastic. \n\nAlso had creme brulee for dessert, which is my favorite and really hard to do wrong.\n\nA great bottle of red wine as well.\n\nThe multiple servers were very friendly, very polite and very helpful and funny.  I found them all to be very accommodating and well trained.\n\nI am saving up to come back on my own the next time I go to Vegas. Yummy.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This review is actually an average of two visits. \n\nFirst visit was back in January of 2013. My friends and I decided to have dinner at delmonicos to spoil ourselves. We were in Vegas for the CES convention so the place was pretty crowded. We had to make reservations in advanced just to make sure we got a table.  \n\nSo what did we get? Bone-in Rib Eye. It was delicious. It was tender. It was juicy. It was pretty much the best steak I've had so far in my short life. The flavors were amazing and the seasoning was just right.. \n\nThen came dessert. I do believe my boyfriend and I had a cheesecake. It was so rich in flavor. While my friends, they had banana cream pies and one had bread pudding. Needless to say, we were very happy. The price was definitely worth it.\n\nService: N/A\nFood: A+++++ \n\nHowever, our second visit in August 2013, everything wasn't what we remembered it to be. The steaks were disgustingly different. They were dry. They were rough. I ordered a medium rare and it came out medium. It was NOT tender. It took a lot more effort to chew than it should for something that's $52. There were NO flavor in it and the seasoning was quite lacking.\n\nWhat the f*ck happened?!?!!!??!!! The steaks tasted like they were fresh steaks versus the dry aged ones that they advertised. \n\n\nTHEIR SERVICE IS FANTASTIC AND IMPECCABLE. \n\nWe had brought up the issue with one of the servers and the manager of the location, Doug, took care of us. My friend's steak, and so was mine, was done three times to see if we were happy with the results. My friend's steak was pretty much rare when she ordered medium rare so they tried to correct that for her. They took the steaks off the check and gave us complimentary desserts. \n\nEven though they tried to correct my steak and even though they had amazing service, I'm not sure if their quality control is at work anymore. The quality was a good 180. The piece of meat they gave me was comparable to a $20 steak from Outback or any other random cheap joint versus the $52 price tag. It could be a bad batch, it could be quality control, but I'm not sure if I'd return to the location.\n\nService: A+++++\nFood: F
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	One of the best meals of my life. Gumbo,  Filet, oliver style was delectable.  A nice 2010 bottle of wine from emerils own collection.  White choco macadamia nut  bread pudding.\n\nOh and the twice baked potato was like silk!\n\nService was great too, very attentive.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I came here for my Bros Bachelor party and we had a party of 5. I made a reservation on opentable.com while i was at work and it was very convenient! We walked over here on saturday night around 6 to start the night off right with a good steak dinner. This place came highly recommended from a friend. \n\nThe restaurant was overly amazing. It was clean and dimly light like most steak places. The waiters were knowledgeable and prompt with their service. I got kind of a pretentious vibe from our waiter which was a little off putting. But it didnt bother me too much.\n\nI ordered the Filet Mignon medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I was very impressed. The steak was soft and flavorful and melted in my mouth. The side dishes were just ok. We ordered broccoli, creamed spinach, and fingerling potatoes. I wasnt impressed by the sides all that much. Not extremely flavorful but still decent.\n\nWe also ordered a $200 bottle of wine which was the most expensive wine i have drank before. I didnt know much about it, the winery was called Mastery and it was a red wine. My bro ordered it not me and it was really good! It was listed on the last page of the wine menu and was $40 a glass, but we ordered a bottle for the table. i wish i figured out what wine it was but it was really really good.\n\nThis is a good spot for a vegas dinner and a great way to start the night! i would definitely check out some other places before i come back here but i recommend it!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	my bf and i were totally looking forward to dining at delmonico.  i like fancy dining, he likes meat, put it together and we usually go to a steakhouse.  however, i did look at the menu beforehand, and noticed there were no crab cakes.  i always have crab cakes before a filet!  so that's probably where the problem started.  i made a reservation a couple months in advance on open table, but even then i could only get a 5:30 rez.  i'm not sure of the entire layout, but it seemed like we were seated in a more private room, which was nice.  the areas we passed through were super loud (staff and wedding party of 20).  gorgeous giant leather seats.  we started off with the "creole boiled gulf shrimp cocktail with tomato horseradish sauce and homemade crackers".  there was definitely some BAM in the sauce.  very peppery and lingers.  the crackers were just as spicy, but why are crackers served anyway?  the shrimp itself didn't taste like it was prepared in any special way.  bf had a bone in strip.  i order one of the specials, kobe sirlon.  i'm sorry this had to be my first experience with kobe.  it was TERRIBLE.  pretty on the plate, thinly sliced, with sinewy strands running all through it.  i was mortified with all the chewing.  i partially blame myself.  i knew i should have stuck with my standard filet medium rare.  sigh.  and now i will probably never go back to delmonico.  the sides consisted of overly buttery country smashed potatoes and tiny fried bay scallops (tasted past its prime to me).  we also ordered an additional side of asparagus, also too buttery.  emeril's banana cream pie was good though.  intricately placed bananas seemed to float between layers of banana cheesecake.  the service is decent, but a bit impersonal.  we made a huge stain on the white tablecloth with a piece of dropped meat, and i expected the server to make a joke at least.  total damage, including tip, no drinks, was $195.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	16 idiots donning wigs came to Delmonico for a bachelor party dinner.  I had called other steakhouses, but since we had a large party, I was told we had to order from a set menu.  Us clods just wanted a delicious slab of steak, some wine and we'd be happy and Delmonico was there to provide.  The only shortcoming was the wait to take our orders, but once our waiter came, it was all good.  The wait staff had a great sense of humor which added to the night's festivities (hell they were serving a bunch of goofballs).  Of course, the best part was the steak.  Most of us at the table had the bone in ribeye steak.  Let me first say I didn't eat much of anything that day in anticipation of this dinner and we didn't have any appetizers or salads and I STILL couldn't finish off that piece of meat!  My steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and was wonderfully seasoned.  Thanks to Delmonico for tolerating the circus sideshow and cooking up some awesome meat..  and sorry to housekeeping that we ordered 4 orders of asparagus!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Five waiters for our table.  Table service was flawless, anticipatory and executed exemplarily.\n\nFresh cut flowers.\n\nImmaculate white linens.\n\nExcellent wine list--featuring Reds and Bordeaux in particular.\n\nEvery course was impeccably good.  \n\nThe bone-in Rib Eye steak and Filet mignon were truly succulent.\n\nThe Creme Brûlée was unparalleled.\n\nI recommend this restaurant with highest regard.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Everything we expected in a celebrity chef steakhouse and more. The service was absolutely top notch. This ties with the best service I've ever had and is second to none from my experience. \n\nWe don't have a lot of experience with wines and there was no hint of pretense or haughtiness from the staff and we felt very welcome and enjoyed the experience. The dress code was casual with no jacket and tie required.\n\nThey have a huge selection of cocktails and wines and we received friendly and helpful assistance in finding a wine to our liking and were immediately offered an alternative after the first selection didn't exactly meet my wife's liking. \n\nThe bone-in ribeye was perfect and I was very pleased with the Cajun seasoning used there (Emeril's). My wife had the rack of lamb and was very pleased with it. The pieces were very meaty. \n\nThe twice baked potato is HUGE and would be easy to share. The vegetable selections are also served with plenty to share so ordering one entrée for each person in a couple with a single potato and single vegetable would work sell. \n\nI can also recommend the crème Brule which had fresh fruit on top and was a very nice dessert to share.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've been wanting to come here for years. My husband and I like to try steak houses around Las Vegas and this one had been on our list for a while. He decided to take me for Mother's Day this year. It actually wasn't as great as I expected.  I heard so many great things about this place but I would give it an "OK."  It's good, but we have been to better steak houses. I ordered the bone in ribeye. It was cooked perfectly though. Kudos to the chef. The best part was dessert!  The pecan pie was delish!! I probably wouldn't come back here again, though. There's other places that I enjoy much more for the same price.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Over-rated!!!!!!!!! My steak was overly seasoned. It was way too salty for my liking. Everyone else at my table was completely disappointed with their order as well. Not worth wasting your time here.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	we got here at 730pm with reservations at 8pm, so we waited for a little bit in their "lounge." here, i asked for water, and the waitress gracefully brought me a glass, even though we were probably expected to order an alcoholic beverage. we waited about 15 minutes in their lounge, and then a waitress took us to our seats. the restaurant was surprisingly large, and we were seated in the middle of the back room. i was surprised at the decor, it was rather.. plain.  plain white walls with dim lighting.. it kind of felt like we were just being seated in a large room. after sitting, the waiter explained to us about the menu, and then left a very large book of alcoholic beverages for us to look over as well.  the menu wasnt too large, which was good for indecisive people like us. :)\n\nto start, we ordered a Lobster Bisque ($12.50) to share, esp after reading the rave reviews about it here. like i said, not hyped. it was sensational. it was so smooth, creamy, and rich, mMm.. i'm drooling right now just thinking about it. for our entrees, i ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb ($48) with a side of Roasted Fingerling Potatoes ($9), and the friend ordered one of their specials of the night--Blue Cheese covered Bone-in Filet with Bacon ($55) with a side of Sautéed Garlic Mushrooms ($9). i'll start with the sides. the potatoes were okay.. nothing too spectacular.. a little bit on the salty side.. but it was a good side if you need veggies (or veggie-related) along with your meat. the mushrooms were good. tasty, cooked nicely, and i dont even like mushrooms! i ordered the lamb cooked to medium, and it was still slightly too red for me, but it was good nonetheless. a little bit on the fatty side, but it was tasty, and came with a popover.. which is this egg-battered bread thing that went really well with the lamb sauce. i actually had a bite of the friend's steak before i dug into my lamb, and boy.. that steak was FABULOUS! the blue cheese, bacon, steak, and tangy sauce that came with it made the steak utterly orgasmic. perfect blend of flavors. the meat practically melts in your mouth. friend got the steak in medium rare, but it seemed slightly more cooked than it should've been. it definitely didnt take away the tenderness though, this was the best steak i've had in my life (and i only took a couple of bites from it). this was one of the specials though, so it probably wont always be available. just writing about it right now is making my stomach grumble. i was craving to see what their desserts would taste like. we decided to go with the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($10). it was really chocolate-y, but for chocolate-lovers like me, it was perfect. it was the cherry on top of an already great meal.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We agree that this was the best filet mignon we ever had. Beautiful crust on the outside and cooked perfectly on the inside. The service was impeccable of course. Side dishes of potatoes and creamed spinach were delicious.  The entire wait staff was very attentive; we never had to get their attention. They seemed to show up at the exact moment we needed them.  Delmonico's will be a must dine on our next trip.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My colleagues and I were in Vegas for one of our fun "day trips" from Silicon Valley and decided to stop by Delmonico Steakhouse, which is located at The Venetian. We were dressed very casually (it was, after all, a day trip) and worried we might be treated differently at an elegant restaurant like Delmonico Steakhouse. We were wrong. From the moment we walked in, we were treated with the best service possible. \n\nThe wine list is extensive, as is the dinner menu, which offered great courses for our varying palates. I enjoyed a filet with "Oscar" and it was absolutely fantastic! My colleagues were all very impressed as well. \n\nWe were also quite impressed by the staff, who were willing to "rush" things for our table, as two colleagues had an earlier flight back home. Excellent food, service, and ambiance will ensure I come back here next time I'm in town.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	If you are a bourbon fan, you will think you have hit the jackpot of all bourbon collections.  Even Rip Van Winkle bourbon is available for the drinking.  \n\nTop notch steak house with incredible care taken in the preparation and display of the dishes.  The chateaubriand is outstanding and the sides were all very amazing including the creamed corn and perfectly cooked asparagus.  Don't forget to try the banana cream pie (it's quite large so you may want to split it)!\n\nService was also top notch.  A team of servers was always available to ensure you could ask questions and ensure you were satisfied with your meal.  \n\nThis place is good for just about any occasion.  They also do tastings if arranged ahead of time of off-menu items such as stuffed quail or other dishes. Highly recommended....you won't be disappointed.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Five stars for the Banana Cream Pie! It's really really good! We decided buying one every time we come! This is the top one dessert for me right now! As good as mastro's butter cake!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	in a nutshell:\n\n-best service I've ever received in a restaurant.  They treat you like you are the owner, totally personal and attentive without ever being intrusive.  The wait team is on the ball with every facet of service\n\n-Food was fantastic of course.  Got the bone-in filet (10oz) which was cooked perfectly, the missus got the filet medallions, which was a bit misleading as these were small steaks, not "medallions"!! Lot of food.  The side dishes are quite large, suitable for 3 or 4, so a party of 2 will have more than enough ordering just 1 side dish.  \n\n-The room is very nice. Uber minimal, nothing on the walls, just nicely sculptured archways and ceilings.  Very nice environment for a phenomenal meal.   The prices are high, esp considering side dishes are all a la carte, but nothing astronomical.  Figure around $100/person for a starter, entree, non-alcoholic drink, dessert, tax and 20% tip.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I really wasn't aware that this restaurant is Emeril's place until I looked it up on msn.com.  In any case, I was dying to taste ribeye in every restaurant and since this place was highly touted as being one of the best in Vegas, I had to go here.\n\nSo surprise, surprise, I ordered the rib-eye.  My wife ordered the filet mignon.  My impression before we received our dishes was that this was an upscale place so we were expecting meats on the level of Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  I was slightly disappointed in that their rib-eye, although good, I felt was only slightly better than a Black Angus steak.  I've had a much better tasting rib-eye from Smitty's in Pasadena.  The filet was nice and tender so that was the bright spot during our dinner date.  We also ordered a couple of glasses of cab and so it complemented our steaks very well.\n\nThe service was, as you would come to expect, excellent.  If it wasn't for the rib-eye, which was lacking some flavor, I would've given it a 5-star rating.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Hmm.  I can't put my finger on why, but I just wasn't blown away by Delmonico.  The food and service were both certainly good, but....I don't know....something was lacking.  It may have been the atmosphere.  Everything seemed very bland and sort of old - for instance, the leather dining chairs all had cracks and chips in them, which isn't what I expect from a place of this caliber.  I guess it just wasn't a very special experience.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Everything I had was great - lobster bisque and filet.  Although all the dishes Could probably be a little less buttery/heavy, I would recommend and return.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	It was a good restaurant but I wouldn't tell a friend "you have to try this place!" \n\nI didn't want to order a whole steak for myself because I was on a diet at the time so I decided to share one with my sister. This was a bad decision. If I have never been able to get along with her, what made me think we can share a steak. This was apparent after she ordered it "medium well" and I shot her a look and remark of "I don't want mine medium well, I want it medium rare" This minor conflict turned uncomfortable for the rest of my family as her and I debated over how our steak should be cooked. (My theory - anything over medium kills the good juicy flavor) All the while the waitress was standing there, listening to us go back and forth about the steak. I don't remember how it ended up being cooked, but I do remember the steak coming out cut in half. Thanks waitress. \n\nThe food was good, I think everyone was pretty content with what they ordered. I don't think any of us thought it was the greatest meal ever, but it worked and we were satisfied. Service was nice, patient, and attentive.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The place? Comfortable yet elegant.\nThe service? Spot on.\nThe food? Really good, but...\n\nSomething was lacking. I had been wanting to try one of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants for awhile and was really excited to dine at Delmonico, but the food didn't blow me away like I had expected it to. Their gumbo was good, but lacked a bit of salt. Their pork chops were good, but could have been a little more tender. My friend noted that the texture of the steak was a bit off. Their desserts were good, but the chocolate cake was kind of dry. Everything was "good", but nothing was great. Wait...I take that back - their dinner rolls were delicious! \n\nAlthough I really enjoyed my Delmonico experience overall, I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. (I have yet to find a steakhouse that I like better than Mastro's!)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The service was great! When our server came, she apologized saying that she thought someone had already taken our order. We didn't even notice, and it didn't feel like we waited long. It could be due to the multiple servers making sure we got our drinks and bread. \n\nWe shared the bone-in ribeye (18 ounce) and the butternut squash ravioli and was not disappointed. My partner's only regret is not ordering a ribeye all to himself. Additionally, when we split it, we only had one choice of how we wanted it cooked. I like rare, and my partner likes medium rare. It came out perfect for both of us. \n\nThe rib-eye was deliciously slightly crispy on the edges with the perfect amount of fat to make it melt-in-your mouth. The flavor was delicious and makes me want more thinking back to it. \n\nThe butternut squash ravioli was very delicious as well and a wonderful surprise. We did not know what to expect of it. My partner loved it. He loved the sweet flavor inside the ravioli. I am personally not a huge fan of the sweet potato genre, and it did taste a great deal like sweet potato with butternut squash texture within a delicious ravioli. It deserves a 10/10, it's just not my preference.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great meal!  Went for lunch and had the truffle potato chips, Caesar salad, lobster sliders, filet medallions and prime burger.  Topped it off with the pecan pie (spectacular) and peppermint chocolate layer cake.  Service was outstanding as well - what a great group from start to finish.  And thanks so much for the surprise pop-overs in our to-go bag!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The past few visits to the Venetian Hotel I've made it a point to eat at Demonico's. The service is impeccable, waiters remove plates the second you are finished and they are very approachable. The most recent trip I had the braised pork appetizer w/cranberry, creole mustard and basil which was delicious. The entree consisted of the charbroiled bone-in filet mignon with roasted root vegetables, fingerling potatoes and jumbo onion rings. Very fun. Thanks to Hector, my server, everything arrived on time and well prepared.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Having been to most of the steak places in Vegas I was excited to try something new so I chose Delmonico's.\n\nHad a reservation but arrived early and they go us in fairly quickly. They aren't overly friendly, the barely look at you and they speed you to your table, but that's where I wanted to be anyway. Service in every other way was impeccable. I was pretty impressed with the waitstaff from the start. They were amazing.\n\nSat down and only had water between me and the business associate I was with. He declined an appetizer, but I chose to have the half dozen oysters on the half shell. They were tiny, but delicious. I definitely would recommend these if you enjoy nice, mildly salty and briny oysters. They had a lot of flavor for the size.\n\nWe both ordered steak; I had the bone-in ribeye and he the filet mignon. I also ordered the foie gras to top my steak.\n\nMy steak was a nice size and it was cooked medium rare with the outside being a little tough and very seared on the outside making it tasted burned almost. I ate around that and was pleased. It isn't the best steak I've ever had, but the prices were reasonable so it hurt less. \n\nThe foie gras was tasteless and a waste of money. I like mine to be buttery and melt in my mouth. Not happening here, save your money. There are a lot better places to get it.\n\nMy associate had the filet and I tasted it; it was tender and moist. It was cooked perfectly, but the outside was pepper coated and it tasted bitter. Not a fan of that.\n\nFor dessert we split the banana cream pie and it was the best part of the whole night. Highly recommend! It tasted like something my mom would make and I loved it! It was big and we couldn't finish it. I bet it would have tasted awesome right out of the fridge the next day, but alas I left it there. \n\nAll in all it's an okay restaurant. I probably won't go back because there are a lot better steak houses, but I enjoyed it for what it was.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Absolutely impressed with this restaurant. The entire dining experience was amazing. My favorite had to be their pork belly. It was meat candy. I could've ordered 2 or 3 and been happy with that for the entire night.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Ahhh. Delmonico. I always make a point to visit this restaurant when I am in Nevada, for this is my favorite steakhouse. The ambience is quite dim, and the overall atmosphere simple and elegant.\n\nWe started out with the truffle and parmesan chips as well as the pork trotter. The chips= simply AMAZING. The chip was light and airy, yet when you bite into it, you get the perfect combination of truffle oil and crisp potato. The pork trotter was also good, but I believe that it was better the last time I came.\n\nAs for the steak, I ordered their signature bone-in ribeye with a side of spinach. The steak came with butter on top, which I found different because not many other steakhouses included that. The steak was delicious; and i was able to finish it without problem.\n\nHowever, I was too full for dessert, and did not have the opportunity to see the desert menu. Last time when I was here, I remember the peach or apple (some fruit) tart with ice cream was the best.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My husband and I ate at Delmonico on our recent trip to Las Vegas. He was there for a job interview and this was our one night out together. The food was good. I got the mixed greens salad and he got the wilted spinach salad. Both salads were very good, especially the wilted spinach. We each got the NY Strip, medium rare. It was not overcooked, which was nice. I thought the rub and char on the steak was good but my husband did not like it at all. We got the creamed corn and mashed potatoes for sides. Creamed corn was very good but the potatoes were a little bland. \n\nAs we were leaving we noticed the signs for a 3 course prix fixe menu. This sign was outside the restaurant and we both remembered seeing it as we entered, but after waiting inside, being seated, and then getting menus we did not remember this. We asked if that menu was currently being offered, and it was. There was a separate insert inside the menu, however, neither of our menus had it. We asked to speak to a manager and he apologized and said it must have been misplaced, or the customers before us didn't insert them back into the menus. Yes, the manager stated that it is the customers' responsibility to make sure their menus are current. It was quite suspicious that NEITHER of our menus had this insert. This makes us suspect a deliberate move by our very attentive waiter. The bigger bill we paid meant a bigger tip for him. We don't care about the money; we feel like this restaurant took advantage of us and the manager did absolutely nothing to try to rectify the situation except make inappropriate excuses.\n\nIf you eat here, you MUST be aware of any special offering if you want to take advantage of it or you won't be told about it. You must also be absolutely certain to replace any menu inserts for the next customer - that is NOT the responsibility of Delmonico Steakhouse, according to their manager. \n\nWe were very, very disappointed and angered by this extremely poor customer service. Being deliberately duped by the waiter was one thing, but to have the manager defend it and make excuses was simply appalling.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I think this is the first time I went to a higher end restaurant in Las Vegas and walked out thinking...it's worth the price.  \n\nOur server was pretty awesome in my mind. Took great care of us and explain the specials thoroughly.  Also helped gave us the idea that the last person at the table should take care of the tab. =)\n\nTheir whole menu sounds tasty....good selection of meats and a lot of sides/appetizers to accommodate your needs.\n\nI ordered the Truffle Oil & Parmesan Potato Chips for my appetizer.\nOMG....it tasted so good.  Best chips I've ever had!!!  It's crunchy...tasty...and best of all...it's cheesy!\n\nFor my entree....I stucked with their Bone-in Rib Eye with a side of corn. I always like my steak medium rare and they cooked it to perfection.  Steak was super tender and juicy.  Dash some horse-radish on the side and I'm happy.\n\nMy buddy Eugene ordered their "Tomahawk" which is basically a 32 oz. Ribeye with a big ass rib to boot.  He topped it off....of course....with some foie gras.  \n\nMost of the table ordered their own rib eye steak....and ordered a lot of different sides to mix it up.  I'll say my favorite was the Wild Mushrooms and the Grits.\n\nOverall, pretty good...will definitely come back to give this place a second spin.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is what every restaurant aspires to be....perfect\nEverything is perfect each and every-time.\nI have been going for what? ten years maybe?\nTheir steaks are always cooked to what exactly you ask for.\nI LOVE THIS PLACE!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My favorite storehouse. Better than Cut better than Maestros better than Ruths Chris. Just can't be beat. Went here again for the kazillionth time this weekend. I always go when in Vegas. So good so good. Never a complaint.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We took my mother here for her birthday and we were all really excited as we are fans of Emeril. The food was good, not great and we had a minor slip up -- which at a fancy restaurant, such as this...there should not be slip ups....here's what happened:\n\nMy sister was chewing her steak and then started crunching on somehting hard -- it was the plastic tab they put in steaks to mark 'how to cook it.' So you think 'oops, they just forgot to take it out, right?' Well, when you think about dining at such a nice place, a steakhouse at that, with famous chefs and executive chefs and the sort....should they even need to have to use the little plastic things to tell when or how a steak should be cooked? \n\nSince it was my mother's birthday they brought her out a free scoop of sorbet. ....yes it could have been nothing, but a scoop of sorbet at a fancy restaurant??? - a baked slice of cake or something made by a pastry chef would have been a little more appropriate and suiting. \n\nThe atmosphere too was very cold and there was no warmth or decor to the place. \n\nThe service was, however, excellent! Very professional and nice. They did take care of the 'slip up,' but I must say, "with all the places in Vegas, I will not be dining there again."
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We have been to many steakhouses in Vegas, NYC and around the country and this rates right with the best of them.\n\nMy wife and I shared an appitizer of tomato and Mazzarella which was very good. She had the rib eye and I had the filet mignon. Both were cooked perfectly and tasted so good. For dessert we had their famous banana cream pie. I highly recommend it and it is enough for two. Also-their espresso was excellent. \n\nThe atmosphere is loud and full of energy. The decor us somewhat plain but nice and clean. Our server was very good and professional. This is a Vegas restaurant I would come back to.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Sunday night\n\nwarning:  optimal for big eaters...wow!  below are the items I tried, ratings out of 5:\n\n- (3) new Orleans rouge cocktail - rye whiskey & pomegranate: nice, potent, simple, but had a tad bit of the cough syrup taste. I guess it didn't have real pomegranate juice.\n- (4) complementary amuse bouche - crostini, cheese, balsamic vinaigrette: a pleasant surprise treat, a nice 2-bite start.\n- (5) truffle & parmesan potato chips:  crispy, oily, & flaky cheesy goodness!  plenty to share.\n- (4.5) rib eye (no bone):  cooked perfectly medium rare, lots of flavor, no need for any jus.  however, I couldn't get my mind out of the other 2 steaks I tasted...the bone-in NY strip & the bone-in filet...wow!  bone-in is definitely the way to go...\n- (3) creamed spinach, potato gratin, & grilled asparagus:  our side choices were pretty average, but loved how the portions are sized for sharing.\n- (5) EXCELLENT SERVICE!  everything was a presentation...from the mention of specials, answers to questions, they announced the highlighted ingredients for every plate and cocktail they put down.  magnificent!\n\nI wish I knew the portions were big enough to share.  I had to throw away half my steak...boo!  no room for dessert.  definitely coming back to share my steak this time so I can try the dessert options.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The best part of the whole experience was the service...they paid a lot of attention to our party of four.\n\nThe worst part were the STEAKS!!!!!!! cold....later warmed up and dry with no taste at all. I can make a much better meal at home!!\n\nI would never come back to spend so much money for horrible food.\n\nI had a duck that was decent but not worth writing home about, sadly :( it was quite dry and all it needed was some of the cane sauce to be poured over it. I wonder if they can cook anything right here when it comes to meat.\n\nquite a disappointment, i am never coming back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went there for a bachelor dinner with 7 guys.The hostess was very accommodating on a Sunday night as we were able to push back our reservation from 730-830 because we had too much fun earlier in the afternoon. Unbelievable meal . Steaks were all excellent , sides (family style) delicious and the seafood tower app was fresh and  adequate for the 5 of us eating seafood . One friend had the lamb chops and was very satisfied. The service was by far the best part , in all honesty . Frank and his assistants were all on point . Strongly recommend for a high end meal, especially if staying at Venetian or The Palazzo .
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I'd probably give Delmonico four stars, except that my expectations were set higher than they probably should have been. In all honesty, The Delmonico did not deliver anything notably better, more worthy of celebrity, than the average high end steak house in Nashville - including Stoney River, Ruth's, or local favorites like Sperry's. I guess I thought that for all the critique Emeril gives Top Chef stars, his restaurant would blow me away.\n\nThe homemade truffle chips were good, and somewhat unique, but perhaps a little over cooked, leaving a numb of chips hard.\n\nOur steaks were indeed prepared excellently, and a quality cut of meat. I had the filet, which was an ample serving and cooked to a perfect medium rare.\n\nBut the twice baked potatoes were a big disappointment. The shells seems to be way overcooked, to the point or requiring a steak knife to cut through them. The flavor was bland, even with cheddar and bacon. A little salt and pepper certainly helped.\n\nWe did enjoy the creamed spinach, even including my colleague who usually doesn't like green things.\n\nThe bread pudding was definitely the way to go on dessert. We also had a slice of banana cream pie, but the star was the bread pudding, which was not ruined with raisins. It was rich, smooth, creamy and delicious.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Always fantastic. This place is a real gem in Las Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Exceptional...exceptional steakhouse!! Ordered ribeye bone out and I've never had such an amazing cut of meat in my life! I died and went to heaven! The service is phenomenal! Had a huge party of about 15 and everyone was well attended too! The sides are superb too! Such a great atmosphere! Sophisticated an chic! Loved loved this place! A MUST when visiting Vegas!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I went here for my friend's bachelor party's dinner.  I am not a steak person but after reading all the reviews here about the bone in rib eye and then hearing the waiter's description I was in for one.  I ordered it Medium Well.  When it came to the table I was expecting it to be tough, chewy, small, etc... When it arrived at the table it was a pretty big slab of meat and  when I cut into it and had my first slice it was totally opposite of what I was expecting.  It was soft, flavorful, and melted in your mouth.  I should have expected that instead since it was priced $52.  Best damn cooked to order piece of steak I have ever had to this day =)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I took a group of eight to Delmonico for business. My party included a number of foodies, including a couple that prided themselves on having been to the best steakhouses around. Most people had steak and Delmonico fared extremely well, with one person saying it was one of the two best steakhouses he had ever been to. We enjoyed the appetizers -- Emeril sure knows his barbequed shrimp! Sides were excellent, including asparagus, creamed corn, and au gratin potatoes. I had the salmon, which was extremely flavorful and perfectly prepared (despite being farm raised). The wine list is extensive and impressive, although finding a reasonably priced bottle was a challenge. Service was truly exceptional.\n\nWe had appetizers to share for the whole table, top-end entrees, and two desserts.  Also quite a few bottles of wine (albeit on the lower end of the price list) and several after dinner drinks.  With tax and tip the meal was a bit over $150/person.  Clearly not a budget place, but for a top Las Vegas restaurant and for the amount we ordered I thought this very reasonable.  You could easily blow the budget on that wine list though!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I didn't get a chance to eat here but the mojitos were absolutely divine. they make their own rum in house and could easily be the elixir of the gods. worth the time, every time. highly recommend.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Again, just wandering Vegas and was hungry so I stumbled in here. I dont really like the ambiance of the place. The decor was blah. It was not minimalist, it was just blah. Anyways, onto the food.\n\nThe steak was good, but not as good as others Ive had. The stand out was the BBQ shrimp appetizer and the lobster bisque. Those 2 made the meal. The BBQ shrimp was in a gumbo like sauce, but it was so good. And then I dipped the bread into the sauce too. The lobster bisque was perfect.  IT came out in a sauce pan and they poured it into my bowl.\n\nService was great, I think I had like 3 servers.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Hands down the best meal and service I have ever had! We all did the three course special which was great and the portions were triple the size what I thought they would be! Michael and Drew were awesome waiters and made sure everything was perfect. I know my family will talk about that night for years to come!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We were sat at 9:15. Dinner arrived at 10:45...  Those of us not drinking wine were not offered anything other than water. Once dinner arrived a couple of the steaks were placed in front of the wrong patrons. Instead of just correcting the issues, the server/manager restated what I ordered (the bone in NY strip). The steak in front of me was very clearly a filet. Our wine glasses were not cleared until our dinner plates were...\nThe steaks were decent. Not amazing, but adequate...  \nRestroom was dirty, toilet seat damaged, no hand towels. \nA relatively pitiful attempt at a fine dining experience.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	So, after several years of not eating at an restaurant of Mr. Lagasse, I finally made it to Delmonico's.  Why might you ask?  Well for one reason - the bone in aged rib-eye steak.\n\nThis was the third Emeril restaurant that I've eaten at.  I used to live in New Orleans and ate at his first restaurant, Emeril's, and his casual outpost, NOLA, several times.  The food was good at times, not so great at other times, but the one thing that was constant was the excellent service.  \n\nDelmonico's continues that tradition.  The service is excellent.  At times, it's a little too friendly, but attentive and not overbearing.  Food came out at a very good pace, allowing for long conversations without interruption.  And the decor is so understated and clean.  It really is a nice change from all of the typical Vegas restaurants with loud lighting and faux-glam decor.\n\nBecause my girlfriend was so eager to try Emeril's food (she's a big fan), we started off with some classics - barbecued shrimp (New Orleans style) and shrimp cocktail with remoulade sauce.  The lunch menu usually has shrimp remoulade over fried green tomatoes.  However, it wasn't on the menu and I really wanted my girlfriend to try it.  The waiter was nice enough to accommodate my request, learned they had some prepared and served it with the shrimp cocktail.  To drink, she ordered a glass of Loosen Bros.  "Dr. L Estate" Riesling and I ordered a glass of Laurent Perrier NV Champagne. \n\nThe Riesling was recommended by the Asst. Sommelier.  The waiter initially recommended an Australian white blend.  But to me, it didn't seem like the best match with the barbecued shrimp because it lacked the acidity to cut the richness of the dish.  When I commented to the Sommelier that I thought the Australian white had Viognier in it, he said it definitely did.  As we talked more, he said the Riesling was a "perfect match" for the barbecued shrimp.  You know what?  It was.  My girlfriend wolfed down half of the barbecued shrimp, taking a sip of the Riesling with each bite.  She even raved - it was a perfect match.  And she also loved the remoulade.  The barbecued shrimp were cooked well, I noticed one of the shrimp I had was a little tough, but the remaining shrimp were plump and juicy.  The shrimp cocktail was great.  Cold, large shrimp, moist, juicy and firm.  They were perfect with the remoulade sauce.\n\nFrom there, we split the bone-in rib eye which was cooked ABSOFRIGGINLUTELY PERFECTLY MED-RARE TO MED.  It wasn't charred, but had that crunch of a good high-temp seared steak.  The twice baked potato with bacon and cheese was sinfully great.  The asparagus was sauteed with garlic and shallots, cooked perfectly through with still a slight crunch.  We shared a half bottle of 2003 Pine Ridge Crimson Creek Merlot which was a good match for the steak.  It had good balance, acidity, but enough soft fruit to please my girlfriend, who doesn't like tannic wines.\n\nDessert was banana cream pie for her, pecan pie for me.  Both were excellent.  The banana cream pie wasn't as sweet as expected, which made it even more easy to eat.  She ordered an espresso martini made with espresso (not the flavored vodka), I ordered a glass of 2003 Carmes de Rieussec Sauternes and finished with a cup of chicory coffee to finish.\n\nWas it inexpensive? Of course not.  It was quite expensive.  But for the excellent quality of food (far, far, far better than Gallagher's and probably the second best only to Bouchon of the restaurants I've eaten at in Vegas) and the best service I've had in Vegas (yes, better than Bouchon), it was worth it.  \n\nWhy 5 stars?  Because everything went right.  Was the service perfect? Almost.  Was the food perfect?  Almost.  Were the drinks perfect?  Almost.  Adding that all together with the right person I wanted to share the evening with, it was perfect.  (Although I didn't ever finish my French Laundry review, that place IS nearly perfect with whoever you go with.  It is still to this day, the best eating experience I have ever had and I've had the fortune of going there 3 times now.)\n\nNow if I could only remember the name of the Asst. Sommelier, I would give him a shout out here.  \n\nI am once again a fan of Emeril.  But please, no "BAM."
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	BAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nEmeril has done good!\n\nITs located in the venetian casino level on restaurant row on the way to the palazzo. the place has a cute bar area where we had to wait for the rest of our party but eventually the hostess sat us first. we had to sit at 2 seperate tables because we had 13people BUT they didnt charge gratuity...although we gave more regardless...\n\nfrom the start our server was beyond nice and welcoming. he helped ben choose his martini, he helped me and a friend chose our red wine which was yummy and we devoured our calamari, filet mignon, bonein ribeye, truffle chips and mushrooms!!!\n\nthe bread they bring out one by one on your plate was SO soft, warm and goooood with the butter, calamari was wonderful even with olives (which im not a big fan of) it was yummy, the filetmignon was cooked well all the way around perfectly seasoned. the ribeye was a REAL winner though super yummmy and HUGGE (obviously hence the place being called delmonico...). the mushrooms were perfect and the truffle chips were delish altho a little TOO greasy for me. \n\nalll the food runners and our server was so nice and the atmosphere like many steakhouses wasnt stuck up but actually really relaxed while still being rather nice. at the end he asked us where we were heading and suggested many different places to check out even tho we were so picky on tryin to decide which bar to head too. he also brought out two desserts with a candle for the two bday boys at our table!\n\nat the end our table of 6 had a bill of near $450  (5 of us got filet or ribeye $45-$55) Ben F and I ate $190 worth hahahah it was a wonderful meal...in a wonderful atmosphere! check it out when in need of a fabulous steak + great wine.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	During a recent visit to Las Vegas, Delmonico Steakhouse was one of our top priorities. We had heard wonderful things about the food and this review was echoed when our driver commented that Delmonico was "one of the best steakhouses in the world." Upon arriving we felt like VIP guests. The bar was sleek and high class. We were there to celebrate and friend's upcoming move and this was the perfect setting. The dining room was tastefully decorated and the minimalistic style allowed us to focus on the delicious food and good company. Among the appetizers we tried our favorites were the Foie Gras and Crabcakes. The appetizers set the tone for what would be an incredible dining experience. I suppose it should go without saying but the next course was STEAK! Filets and Bone-in Ribeyes were the popular picks with the guest of honor going for the Filet Oscar (a filet topped with jumbo crab meat), which was the group's favorite. The steaks lived up to their reputation. The sides were a la carte and were great for sharing. And it was all tied together with a Sineann Pinot Noir from the expansive wine list. We enjoyed the meal so much we did not get a chance to try the dessert menu. Service was outstanding. Our server, Michael, was very attentive and enhanced the entire experience. Everyone ranked our evening at Delmonico amongst their favorite dining experiences. The food, drinks and service were top-notch and it was the perfect send-off for a good friend.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico's is an interesting venue for dining. \nMy first impression was that the decor was very understated for a "quality dining"experience.\nAs we waited a short time for our table to be prepared, we were invited to the lounge and bar - it was not impressive.\nThe table selection, at first seemed unimpressive, but after a short while we began to appreciate our location.\nWe were seated near the entrance to the dining room, but were hoping for a table deep into the interior.\nAsthe evening proceeded, we found that we could have a very fine conversation, while those dining well into the room had to raise the level of their conversation just to be heard over the din coming from  the remainder of the room.  \nThe first component of the five star trating came with the extensive wine list.\nThe wine list will amaze anyone. A selection for every taste .....  \nThe service is also five star. Any need you have will be well attended at Delmonico's.\nI have a hard time believing that I went to one of the very best steakhouses in Las Vegas and ordered Salmon.\nI thought if Emeril Lagasse is associated with this steakhouse then the fish selections would be first rate.\nI was not wrong !\nI enjoyed the crabcake appetizer -  it was just supurb.\nThe BBQ Salmon was astoundingly good and cooked to perfection. \nA wealth of flavor in every bite. \nThe steaks ordered by the rest of the table were huge and exceedingly good.\nThe table shared a chocolate blackberry cake for desert and it was the perfect pair for a fine selection of tawny Port.\nOnce again, the service provided by the staff was excellent throughout the meal. \nSimply an amazing dining experience.\nFirst class all the way ...........
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Steak and sides were tasty although not nearly as well prepared or delicious as the food at Ruth's Chris. The pecan pie desert was actually the best part of the meal and the chicory coffee was horrible. Wine list offered $40.00 bottles of wine for over $100.00. Service was excellent which it should be when your paying so much money for your food. Ruth's Chris is much better steak and sides for less money. A fun experience but will not be back for a long time.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Steak that melts in your mouth.  Crispy, flavorful asparagus & attentive service.  \nEverything that came out of the kitchen was perfect.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	was there this past weekend with a group of 7 people... not a disappointed person in the party. the staff was super friendly and accomodating (we had children with us). i had mushroom crusted filet medallions. so good. we got sides of grits, corn and steamed broccoli... all three were great. we also ordered a few desserts, the banana cream pie was outrageous. so fresh and tasty. i didnt have the wine but my friends really enjoyed the bottle that was recommended to them.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've heard mixed reviews from friends for Delmonico but I really enjoyed it! Too bad I stuffed myself during brunch at Bouchon, I really wanted to try more at Delmonico.\n\n+ easy to make reservations via Opentable.com (in fact I changed my reservation easily via smartphone)\n+ great location in the Venetian/Palazzo restaurant row; close to multiple show theaters\n+/- huge restaurant (didn't notice from outside but there's a lot of tables)\n- sitting by the kitchen; another group asked to be moved too because the bus boys run in and out of there like their shoes were on fire, it was kind of nerve-wrecking to watch them\n- the place wasn't 100% packed even though it was Christmas so I don't understand why the wait service was meh (no butter, no bread until after appetizers, slow to refill water, etc.)\n+ waiter hadn't come back to take our order and a manger (or whatever the guys in the suit vs. the aprons are called) stepped in\n+ we ordered the Chateaubriand $105 (for 2) for the 3 of us ("no, it's not frowned upon" haha)\n+/- the sides that came w/ the meat was okay (the mashed potatoes wasn't as bad as everyone says and the asparagus was so forced - it's not even in season right now)\n+/- Traditional New Orleans Gumbo $10 was not worth it - it was decent but I wouldn't order it again or recommend it to anyone (and whats up with serving it in a small sauce pan on the bowl, then pouring it into the bowl - does that mean that pan was just on the stove top aka dirty? and I didn't even get a chance to pick out all the green onion before it got mixed in, sigh)\n+ Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad $17- pricey but it was tasty and this is coming from someone that doesn't like tomato unless it's in salsa form\n+ tasty wine and hefty wine BINDER ;-)\n\nWe debated ordering a dessert but none of it sounded appetizing. If you can get it at the buffet, save the calories.\n\nI may come back to try some more stuff but there are so many more restaurants I need to try the next time I'm back in Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Nice atmosphere and wonderful service. I had the dinner special which was a wedge salad, a petite ribeye, and desert.   \n\nThe salad was as expected. Nothing to jump up and down about. The petite ribeye was tasty. Just a minute over cooked, but overall it was good. The desert was ice cream and cake. As I'm not a cake eater I can't tell you about that, but the ice cream was good. \n\nOverall, it was a pleasant dinner.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3.5\n\nI had high hopes for Delmonico, as many had said some great things.  Being an Emeril restaurant I figured it was just another celebrity chef restaurant, so I had my reservations.  The place was well decorated and had a great vibe.  The food was up to par and certain items had great taste, such as the lobster bisque.  I was hoping for more with the wilted spinach salad, but it was still OK.  The complimentary amuse bouche was a nice touch, tasted like a truffle cream of mushroom.  Now the steak, everyone says to go with the bone-in ribeye, so that's what I got.  Tasty, but needed a bit more flavor.  Not as buttery and smooth as other high end steakhouses.  Service could use some attention for a restaurant of this caliber.  Forgot our truffle potato chips and service went downhill with the way they took our plates and such.\n\nNot sure I'd go back with all the other many celebrity chef restaurants to try, but it's definitely one of the better ones.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Took my girlfriend to Vegas for her birthday (and secretly, to propose), and was planning to take her to a nice dinner.  Went to Delmonico on a suggestion from a trusted friend, and damn, glad I did.  He may be annoyingly over the top on TV, but Emeril and company know what they're doing.\n\nRight from the beginning wait to be seated, until the ending dessert and coffee, we had a great time with great food.  In a "that is so Vegas" twist, our waiter looked like Wayne Newton.  They were great on recommending drinks and pick of entrees, and answered all questions off the menu.  Service was even to such a level that they helped my lady with her seat, which is good, since the chairs are heavy. \n\nAs to the food. . . *glarg* *drool*  Sorry, I get moisture in my mouth thinking about it.  Shrimp the size of my thumb after I hit it with a hammer covered in a fantastic spicy cream sauce, steak that you could cut with a spoon, a portion of the most tender venison I've ever had, that was just as good when cold the next day (because I couldn't eat all of it), a martini that made it harder to walk out of there than the amount of food I ate, incredible desserts, and well, an espresso menu that involved such quality coffee I had no idea coffee that good existed.\n\nI don't eat at high caliber steakhouses on a weekly basis or anything, but I've been to a few, and it's not like DC has a shortage of them given the wealth there.  Vegas is the same sort of way -- artificial city with lots of money -- and damn if Delmonico didn't top anything I've had so far when it comes to high caliber steak places.  \n\nAnd in case you're wondering -- she said yes.  I'm sure that was in part due to this dinner. ;)\n\n~EEE~
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is what a steakhouse ought to be. Located in the Venetian/Palazzo complex, it's divided into several rooms, all pleasantly decorated. The ambience is relaxed and friendly. The wait staff is attentive without being overbearing. There's none of the pretense you get at, say Carnevino in the same hotel complex. There is a nice energy level but you can easily hear each other.\n\nWe brought a wine bottle from home and the wait staff was fine with it. They politely informed us of the corkage fee (a reasonable $30) without making us feel weird about having brought our own bottle the way some places do.\n\nWe started with a very tasty shrimp cocktail to share. Then I moved on to the Piedmontese boneless strip steak, which was delicious. Helen had the salmon, which was like butter. Potatoes au gratin made a nice side.\n\nEverything was perfectly cooked, impeccable in quality, and served with refined flair.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	So overall the food was amazing - we had shrimp and biscuit for appetizer with a delicious romaine salad, then filet mignon. The bread was to die for, the ambiance, and service were excellent...why not 5? \n\nMy steak was overcooked...I ordered medium, it was well...and this is a steak house. However, everything else was very well prepared and delicious. I will give them another try my next time in vegas!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My husband and I dined here for my 40th birthday. We were treated like royalty and loved every minute. He had the chateaubriand and I had the salmon. Both were incredible. I can't wait to visit Vegas again just to eat here!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went there for the thanksgiving dinner. What a mistake! Dry turkey with horrible tasting green beans. Also ordered mojitos and they were the worse I've had. I do not know about the rest of the menu but the thanksgiving dinner was overpriced and gross. The two stars are for the dinner roles and the parmesan chips.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Let the 5 star rating speak for itself. Absolutely delicious mind blowing steaks served here. The bone-in ribeye was grilled to perfection. Topped with butter. Seriously, could you ask for anything more. I had tears welling up in my eyes it was so good. I was having a moment. Tender beyond belief. The cajun rub did not taste cajun. It tasted like seasoned perfection.\n\nExcellent sides and appetizers. Wine list, extensive. Decor wasn't my style but very simple - nothing to write home about. The staff was very attentive, helpful, and courteous. \n\nAgain. Mind blowing!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	7 girls, after a long 4 hour drive, arrived at the Venetian on a mission for some hearty steak.  Delmonico was the answer to our problem.  We were so exhausted that we didn't even bother pretty-ing ourselves up before hand...dumped out bags and headed straight to dinner.  We were worried that our shorts and flip-flop attire wasn't going to cut it but aside from some dirty stares from some of the other guests, the wait staff kindly turned their heads.  \n\nThe service was impeccable.   They started us off with a goat cheese puff pastry to cleanse our pallets, compliments of the chef.  All of us buddied up and ordered the Bone-in Ribeye Steak...which was plenty to go around.  Tasty, it sure was but I'd have to say, I've had better.  The garlic mushrooms, creamed corn, cheddar bacon grits, and sauteed asparagus sides were great compliments set in the middle of the table for all of us to share.  We were seated at a circular table which was ideal for conversation instead of screaming across a long table.  By dessert, we were stuffed...next time for sure.  \n\nSince we didn't order any wine to compliment the dinners that we all split, Delmonico left the robbing of our $$ to the casinos.  I know if I went with just my boyfriend, it'd be one less night we could stay at the Venetian.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	"Too much of anything is bad, but too much good whiskey is barely enough" - M. Twain\n\nLoaded with more whiskey than most whiskey drinkers will ever try, I think Delmonico still boasts the largest selection of whiskey in Vegas...I know they did in the recent past. Either way, there are a plethora of whiskey options to elevate your safe, Emeril, food choices while at Delmonico. \n\nDelmonico is also home to a fantastic craft cocktail program...seriously one of the best in town...and also the reason that you should visit every so often. This as actually rather troublesome for me because given their range of whiskeys I'm forced to choose between flights whiskey, pours of favorites that you can't find most places and excellent craft cocktails...and the craft cocktails include every type of spirit, so even the problematic non-whiskey lovers can enjoy something amazing.\n\nSuffice it to say, Delmonico is home to 5 star adult beverages with typical 3.5 star Emeril Lagasse food.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went here over the past weekend just to try. Have been to other steakhouses like cut, Ruth cris, morels, summit house in Fullerton, and lawrys. Safe to say food was decent considering the price. \n\nFilet mingnon was tender but good. Not great. I have liked the filet at cut much better. \n\nCrab legs were bland but amazingly precut and offered at either a cold or hot temperature. \n\nThe lobster bisque was ok too. I think I had expected the greatness I found with McCormick's lobster bisque. Safe to say for the price I would probably go to cut again or lawrys or McCormick. Probably wouldn't want to go back here. Sorry kids. But that's just me.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Celebrated hubby's birthday here.  The whole experience was top notch from the service, the food, and the attention to detail.  The moment we walked into the restaurant, the host greeted us by saying "Happy Birthday" to my hubby, which started the night great for us.  For once, I didn't get a side eye or a raised eyebrow when I asked my steak to be well-done; there was no snobby attitude from our server, and all the food we ordered was cooked to perfection.  Hubby ordered the bone-in ribeye (medium), I ordered regular ribeye, and we shared twice baked potato.  Their portions were so generous that we had no room for dessert.  Specialty cocktails didn't live up to my expectation and was a bit of a let down, but deceptively strong so worth the money.  Over all, really great first time experience here.  Oh, and a shoutout to our server Dale, who was nice, witty, and took care of us.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	How could anyone give this place less than 5 stars.  The food is great.  Everything went perfectly.  I wish I could eat here everyday...  I usually split the Chateaubriand with a friend.  I would recommend Delmonico to everyone that wants an amazing experience with great food.\n\nRegards,\n\nAdam
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I took my wife here for our anniversary last year. The service was outstanding (I think we had three waiters just for our table) and the food was excellent. I had the sea bass and she had the pork chops, both were cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful. For desert they had root beer ice cream and I swear it felt like it was carbonated. The decor was OK but they could do a little more.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Good steak, good wine, good grits, no complaints...minus the bill
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Hints: Bone-In Rib Steaks\nBone-In Rib Steaks\nBone-In Rib Steaks\nBone-In Rib Steaks\nBone-In Rib Steaks\nBone-In Rib Steaks\nOk, you should get it by now.\n\nMore Hints: \nThe mushroom sauce is too salty for my taste bud.\nService is always excellent every time I come here for dinner.\nBone-In Rib Steaks is always cooked to perfection, everything else here is just average .\n\nOne last Hint: \nBone-In Rib Steaks
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AOL Keyword: Bone-in ribeye
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The pro: The steaks here are the best. Actually even the appetizer and the side dishes are excellent. We ordered the calamari and homemade chips (really tasty) as our appetizers. The asparagus was enough for all four of us to eat (and only $9) the baked potato was hella good too.\n\nThe con: It is very pricey, steaks start off at about $48, but well worth it. Even if you can only eat here once just do it, very tasty.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great service from the get go! The steak fish are delicious but please save room for emerils banana cream pie omg it's  the best.\nWhen in Vegas always make sure to eat at emerils restaurants.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	If you're looking for good steak, you go to Delmonico.\n\nThis place is classy as hell and I loved it. The waiter was very nice and knowledgeable and a funny guy.\n\nThe bone in ribeye was perfect. Medium rare, juice oozed out, flavor exploded. Exactly what you want. The grits were good too, but the cheesy potato side was a standout.\n\nWe had a hair in our dessert and our waiter brought over the manager, comped the dessert and gave us another dessert on top of that! The caramel cake and the creme brûlée were good ways to end the night.\n\nHonestly, I want to live in the steak.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The excellent: 1) Waiter Frank was very helpful and personable and was dead-on with food recommendations! 2) the barbeque shrimp was the highlight of the meal; its sauce was so flavorful and a definite must-get item! 3) very nice touch of congratulatory dish written in chocolate and complementary dessert! The bad: we received NY strips instead of rib-eyes and steak not impressive at all; did not taste like it was a prime cut - too lean and very little flavor, although foie gras was cooked perfectly. Restaurant touts of 7 week aged beef but couldn't tell - have had more flavorful steaks from Costco. Won't go here again because of the unimpressive steak quality, even though service, ambiance, and appetizer was excellent.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	If you want a perfectly executed, consistent steak, this place is where you go.  Everything is the gold standard.   I had a medium rare ribeye that was wonderful.  Sides were great and the bread.... so good that you can just eat the bread alone.\n\nMy biggest issue, it's boring.  Really boring.  If you've had an expense account like me due to work, you eat at these places every month and although it's great, it gets boring.   Same type of people, same type of customers, dressed the same way.     I know... first world problems.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I think this place can serve bologna sandwiches and still get a 5-star rating solely based on how good their customer service and wait staff is here! We started out with the fried oysters and the petite wedge salads. The oysters were incredibly fresh and crispy. Do the pro move and ask the waiter to bring out some crystals hot sauce to put on the top if you really want to make it Cajun, also smeared some blue cheese on top of mine from my wife salad which made it over the top good. For the main course we split the Chateaubriand and the cut was really  nice and seasoned and came with a side of asparagus and Lebanese potatoes. On our next visit I think we will stick with getting just the bone in ribeye as it looked a little better and then ordering our sides ala carte. For dessert we had the banana cream pie which was not overly sweet and the contrast  with the chocolate shavings on top giving it that slight bitter taste mixing with that creamy goodness.  The cappuccino was very good and was the excellent end cap to an extraordinary meal.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place is about as bland as vanilla ice cream.... there is no style to the dining room, the service is slow and quiet, the steaks well... I have had much better... the only good is the deserts are very good, and the palce has a great wine list (albeit very pricey)... Vegas can do better (and it does)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I enjoyed my food good price great service but i have had better but would definetly will come here again
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Excellent steakhouse. Well designed to be classy with some modern touches but not too modern you don't feel like you aren't in an old fashioned steakhouse.\n\nThe filet mignon done au poive was superb (5/5). Not necessarily the most traditional prep but the cajun seasoning combined with the crusted pepper and very tender beef made for an awesome bite.\n\nThe bone in rib eye (5/5) was also cooked expertly and one of the most flavorful and not too fatty pieces of steak I've had.\n\nThe shrimp cocktail (3.5/5) was nice but I thought standard cocktail sauce would have been better. The slice of avocado and sprig of microgreens made it nice.\n\nService was on point and very professional. \n\nWould come back here again. Thought it was better than Cut Steakhouse in the Venetian.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We had early reservations for a party of 9 for my 40th birthday. We were seated at a lovely table and were all surprised how we could hear everyone without having to strain. This means the acoustics in the room we were in were spot on. \n\nOur waiter was Lamont and there were various other folks helping us out. We were all served warm buttery rolls that had both a salt and we are pretty sure bit of sugar sprinkling on them. Drinks were ordered by a few of us-I imbibed just a bit as it was my birthday after all and the drinks were good, reasonably priced and tasty. \n\nEverything we ate was wonderful. We started with 2 orders of house made potato chips with truffle oil and Parmesan. They were yummy and the perfect combination of salt and grease to help the booze go down easily. Some of us had starters, some of us chose not to. \n\nI had the lobster bisque to start and it was heavenly with perfectly cooked lobster and nice pieces of it. Others had the Gumbo (no seafood-heat but not hot), the heirloom tomato and Burrata cheese salad. There were also a couple of other appetizers ordered-BBQ Shrimp (delicious and unlike anything we had before) and Escargot(I was too chicken to try it).\nTruffle Parmesan potato chips\n\nFor mains, people had \nFilets\nBone In Rib-eye \nSalmon\nScallops\nMedallions of beef\n\nSince sides are generous, we all shared:\nAsparagus\nCreamed Corn-delicious (and I make my own just as good)\nCreamed Spinach (the most boring)\nSauteed Mushrooms-fabulous\nPotato Gratin\nTwice Baked Potatoes\nGrits (meh-but not for me texturally)\n\nWe were all so full, we only ordered one dessert to share and that was the infamous Banana cream pie. Worth every bite and every calorie-in fact....\n\nKevin and I came back here for lunch our last day in Vegas!\nWe shared the BBQ shrimp, I had the lobster bisque again and he had the heirloom tomato salad. We also shared another slice of the banana cream pie and I would do it again in a heartbeat. \n\nFabulous birthday dinner and wonderful company!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Finally made it here after wanting to go for so many years.  From the moment we got there we were greeted by the hosting area and whisked away to our table.  They pulled the chairs out for me and my guest and made sure we were comfortable.  They even asked if I wanted my jacket placed on the empty seat next to me, wow.  Head waiter came over and introduced himself and his team that were going to serve us for the night.  Sommelier came over and asked if I need any help picking out a wine.  being the wine geek that I am I had no problem browsing thru the incredible list/book and picked out a delicious red burgundy.  We ordered the truffled potato chips and boy were they good, yummo.  We skipped on a big appetizer because we didn't want to get too full.  We both ordered the Bone In RIb Eye and it was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten that I was sucking the tasty bone with no shame.  One incredible meal and one of the best I have had in Vegas.  This is the place and I will be back for sure...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Do not order the lamb!  It is 70 % fat or better.  They warned me but I just could not imagine that much fat could be on these chops! It was obscene!!  \n  The chips were very good ; and the liquor and wine lists are some of the most complete anywhere . \n  The servers behind the bar were attentive but it was REALLY obvious that they have a slight touch of  animosity toward the guests.  Perhaps here in Las Vegas the guests are a bit abusive , that may account for the latent attitude .  Mind you , they don't display it to your face , but if You keep your ears and eyes open ,  you can easily pick up on the glares and hushed cross talk between them .  Given the world as it is though , can anyone expect them to be anything but a little jaded?  All in all , 4 stars
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I was very pleased with this restaurant.   \nWe were celebrating an anniversary and both maitre D and wait staff greeted us with "Happy Anniversary".\nThe restaurant itself was lovely, comfortable, and busy, but not noisy. We certainly had privacy at our table. \nThe staff was helpful and considerate. The food was excellent and plentiful. Lots of variety and the staff was respectful of allergies/dietary restrictions. It was pricey, but we spent far less than we anticipated. \nMy only regret is that we didn't have enough room for one of their fabulous desserts. \nI would not hesitate to dine there again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had an all around fine meal at Delmonico on our recent trip to Las Vegas.  I also went to Wolfgang Puck's CUT and gave it 4 stars on this trip.  The only real difference was that Delmonico cooked my NY Strip perfectly medium rare vs. just a bit over at Puck's place.  The rest of the meal from service to apps to salads was first rate.  The gumbo was yummy with a dark brick roux used and plenty of chicken, seafood and andouille to complement.  They put a big ole hunk of Maitre d butter on each steak and this, along with the Cajun seasoning (am assuming Emeril's trademark Essence) and the natural juices from the prime, aged beef lead to a wonderful liquid on your plate for dipping each tender bite.\n\nService was as attentive and on point as one would expect at these prices.  Sorry Wolfgang, Emeril wins this showdown by .5 of a star!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place was the bomb-digity!  One of the best meals I've ever had.  I know they are known for the bone-in ribeye but go with the filet oscar style.   My crew and I were out for my bachelor party and we had a 10:30PM dinner and we ended up staying there till about 1 in the morning.  The wait staff was awesome, not pushy at all and very helpful.  Even joked with us a little bit.  We were definitely the last ones in the place but they were happy to let us stay as long as we wanted.  Highly recommend this place, very classy.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place was EXCELLENT!  We were on the hunt for a great steakhouse and we definitely found it here.  The food and drinks were excellent and there were many options to choose from.  One thing I find in many upscale steakhouses is a somewhat limited menu with only a handful of entrees and appetizers to choose from.  Delmoico's has an expansive menu and everything was delicious.  the atmosphere and food made for a great night out... definitely try if you are looking for a nice night out (for steak) in Vegas!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Simply delicious!\n\nI went with a group from work while attending a meeting and everyone seemed impressed with the food. We started off with a few appetizers including the calamari which was a little on the salty side, roasted butternut squash ravioli with duck and the crab cakes. \n\nI had the spinach and radicchio salad with apple rosemary vinaigrette and warm pistachio crusted goat cheesecake. Yep, that's right, you heard me... a goat cheese cake. It was fantastic. \n\nFor my entrée I was worried because I had already filled up on the appetizers and my delicious salad but I managed to eat my Filet Mignon medallions with a bacon peppercorn sauce.  We split a few sides as a table including the broccoli, asparagus and some delicious corn dish. I have no idea who ordered it but for the love of all that is holy, you have to get this corn dish. It was phenomenal. The broccoli not so much... too al dente for me!\n\nFor dessert there were a few orders of the bread pudding and banana cream pie which no one seemed to complain about. The service was a little slow but maybe it was because the place was packed. There was way too much time in between courses. Oh and it took at least 30 minutes to get drinks each round. Maybe go early before the rush hits or just don't go with a party of 13 like we did.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We had dinner reservations here at 6:00 on March 4th, & I was excited to eat here because I use so many of Emeril's recipes at home.  We were seated promptly.  However, I stumbled on a chicken leg on the way to our table, & it was all down hill from there.  The 16 oz. Ribeye was flavorful, but overpriced, considering it was almost 1/2 fat.  When my boyfriend commented, our waiter laughed & said, "that's typical for a Ribeye" & walked away.  After that, we didn't receive any further service from him.  I had the fried chicken, which was $38, & came with black-eyed peas that had no flavor.  Our drinks were just Tito's vodka and cranberry juice at about $14 each.  I had one piece of chicken, & we were done.  The atmosphere was not warm & inviting, & the flavorless food was definitely overpriced.  We were incredibly disappointed & will not eat here, again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Second time dining at DelMonico.  Food was great service was on\nPoint. A must when in Las Vegas
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place is amazing!! This is our second time to visit Delmonico and we were equally as delighted as our first time. We really did it up...\n\nFor apps, we got the BBQ shrimp (awesome) and the oysters. Both are highly recommended.\n\nMy husband got the lobster bisque and I got the heirloom tomato salad.. the tomato salad was $18. Was that ridiculous? Yes. Was it worth it? Also yes. \n\nI got the filet medium done, and my husband got the bone-in rib eye medium rare. My steak was perfection.. my husbands was too medium.. The staff were quick to correct the error and apologetically brought him a new steak. Talk about wonderful service! \n\nWe shared grits (so yummy and I am NOT a grits girl), and the asparagus. \n\nFor dessert we sampled the banana cream pie.. like everything else we had, it was really special :)\n\nOverall, this is a wonderful place to splurge! The service is accommodating and helpful.. the food is well worth the money, and the ambiance is great :)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Didn't eat.  Sat at bar and had wine.  Pretty reasonably priced considering it's vegas.  Wine by glass list well above average.  Very competent bartender.  Would return.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The food was really good, but I've had better.  The atmosphere was somewhat pretentious and uncomfortable, but nicely done.  $10 to add broccoli with my $62 steak seemed a bit gouging.\n\nService was above reproach.  Knowledgable and sincerely friendly staff.\n\nWould I eat at Delmonico's again?  Absolutely.  But my expectations will be lower next time.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I'm soooo bummed! Wanted to love this place! Brought my hubby based on the reviews. Lobster bisque....amaze balls! Scallops......sooo salty they were not edible. Filet was raw even though I ordered it medium. Manager was so sorry that they comped the scallops, comped dessert, and comped a salad. Our whole meal was basically wrong or ruined. I'm glad they comped, but still.......umm probably won't be back. Bummer :(
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've eaten here twice, it was better a few years back. The steak wasn't that great quality in general for the steak. The sides and salads were excellent. I'm kind of upset that they share the name with the fantastic steakhouse Emeril owns in New Orleans.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I'm a big fan of Emeril's cooking and love his steakhouse within The Venetian hotel. I always stay at adjoining The Palazzo and love walking through both hotels to arrive at the restaurant. The filets are amazing! Perfectly cooked medium rare just the way I like it and wonderfully seasoned. Service is excellent with an extensive wine list. The BBQ shrimp is delicious and do try desserts. We had a fantastic dinner here. Thank you Emeril!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	wonderful decor and ambiance.  simple, modern and elegant.  comfy chairs too.   as others have stated the restaurant is a little loud (which I liked) but the tables are spaced comfortably apart so you can still enjoy an intimate dinner.  \n\nstellar service.  John and his group were attentive without being snooty and overbearing.  we felt comfortable.  i don't think there was ever a moment when our glasses reached half empty glass before they addressed it.  any little crumbs on the table were quickly taken care of.  definitely the service I was expecting from a top notch Vegas establishment.\n\nexpect to spend about $100 / person.  everything is a la carte.  entrees were about $50, sides about $10, cocktails about $15 and wine $$$$.\n\nhuge portions.  if you had any food earlier in the day,  don't expect to finish your entree, especially if you order the bone rib steak. \n\nenjoyed a delicious meal:\n- crabcake topped with fennel and tomatoes (very good!)\n- bone rib steak (lots of marbleization, good, but was not wowed)\n- parmesan fillet medallion (very good!)\n- parmesan truffle potato chips (soo bad, but ooh soo tasty)\n- asparagus (gotta have a veggie)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Possibly the best steak I ever had. Bone in Rib steak. Definitely recommend. Place is pricey, but 5 stars. Staff was extremely helpful and nice. Had a great experience. Didn't feel at all like I was in a shopping mall in a Casino like some other Vegas spots.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had a very nice birthday dinner here and really, really enjoyed it. The atmosphere is simple and classic, it occurred to me that they were striving to feature the food with such simple ambiance, and they succeeded. \n\nThe service was fantastic, we had a team of servers for our party of 6 and we did not wait for a single thing throughout dinner. They did manage to find that balance between being attentive and hovering, it was perfect. Hubby and I had the table side prepared Cesar salad and it was excellent. For dinner I had the rare filet and I really enjoyed it, and the table shared the grits (my personal favorite of the entire dinner), spinach and mushrooms. For desert we had the peppermint profiteroles, which were so so (I'm not a big peppermint fan though). \n\nI really enjoyed dinner and highly recommend it for a nice dinner in Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We have eaten here multiple times over the years.  We have enjoyed the chef's table on 3 different occasions, including a family dinner the night before my sister-in-law got married.  \n\nThe service is wonderful and we have never had bad service in the dining room, bar or chef's table. \n\nThe food is spectacular.  If you are a carnivore - thls is will be a religious experience.   The steaks, lamb chops, foie gras, fresh raw oysters, and \n\nA couple of things not to miss:\n        Appetizers: N.O. barbecue shrimp,  truffle, parmesan potato chips\n        Entrees:  American Buffalo ribeye, the bone-in ribeye, lamb chops\n        Dessert:  brioche bread pudding, Delmonico chocolate cake\n\nWine List:  I swear the darn book weighs 10 pounds.  They have an extensive wine list and it can be intimidating.  I have found the sommelier  has always been approachable (some restaurants have sommeliers that are kind of snotty or stand offish) and helpful.\n\nAdult Beverages:  I like champagne and wine but they have some really nice cocktails and I would suggest trying one or two.  \n     The Lady Lychee\n     A Tale of Two Cherries\n     La Flor Mayor - for a little kick  \n\nThey also have an impressive list of whiskey & whisky.\n\nThere are several seating areas of the restaurant, so you can have an intimate meal, a family get together or enjoy a group of friends.  I enjoy sitting on the long bench because it is comfy and I can people watch.\n\nIf you have a special event, reserve the Chef's Table but show up hungry because they are going to FEED YOU!  No tasting size dishes and they will toss in a surprise or two.  Like the time we had a wonderful ribeye main course, and thinking we were getting dessert, in walks another main course!  A spectacular lamb chop that was the best I have ever eaten.  \n\nAnd if you are just looking for some munchies and a drink - visit the bar.  Michelle is a great bartender and the food is the best bar food you will find.\n\nOr need your Emeril dessert fix - pop into the bar and have a dessert with a vintage cocktail.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I agree with all the raves regarding the food however the restaurant itself lacks any real ambiance. Tucked away on the first floor of The Venitian we were disappointed by lack of personality given the location,  Vegas, and being so highly rated. Food, of course,  was excellent.  Loved my wilted spinach salad and the bone in ribeye was terrific.  Just anticipated more of a dining experience.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I absolutely love treated myself to an awesome steak dinner at least once a month. Was there last week for March Madness and came here with my boyfriend and a couple other friends. Our server, Frank, was amazing!!! We all felt really comfortable with him and felt at home. He made our experience very memorable. We talked about music, life, our home heritage and all sorts of stuff. I hope he's working next time we are in town. As for the food I ordered the wagyu filet which was thee best piece of meat I've ever had!!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	its about on par with craft steak...the sides were ok...the prime rib was superb...me likey
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3 stars for the wine list.   2 for the steak.  I've gotta say that the service and ambiance was astounding given they let me bring my 3 foot tall yard full of long island ice tea, from the flamingo no less, to the table.  Greater than that? the wait staff were kind enough to fill it up with ice for me as I left it sitting there, as our center piece.  \n\nThe wine list was insane.  It must have been 50 pages.  In the end we ended up going with something simple because we were already pretty hammered from our fun in the sun.  The appetizers were decent from what I remember, but the anti-pasto salad looked like cold cuts from my mom's fridge.  It just wasn't presented well for the type of clout this place assumes.  So here I am, dining Euro style waiting 2 hours for the steak to finally arrive, chewing on my day old bologna and it finally arrives...\n\n...and it sucks!  I got the bone in rib-eye, one of my favorite cuts, and it was "toasted" excessively and really lacked any distinguishable flavor!  I couldn't believe that i was paying this kind of money for a steak I was making in my BBQ baby years.  And you know how sometimes things taste so, so good when you're trashed?  I couldn't imagine my feelings had I been sober.  \n\nBut I'm not so sure it was all bad - my friends had some pretty good Filet, and the soup was good from what I understand.  It's just not going to be MY first choice for a favorite dining spot in Vegas.  Like I said though, the wait staff was great, the wine list amazing, and the silverware clean.  \n\nEmeril - try again... and for you readers - try The Mesa Grill instead...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Outstanding service, an intimidating large wine list and great steaks.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The service was great and the food was delicious!! Make sure you go in hungry, the portions are huge!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We were at DelMonico's last year to celebrate my boyfriend's sister's 21st birthday. That meant there were A LOT of us! The atmosphere was awesome, but then again, every restaurant in Vegas has some degree of nice ambiance, right? Anyhow, our large party wasn't able to sit together, which really sucked because we had made reservations and they expected all of us at that time. So, my boyfriend, me and his two cousins got our own mini-table. We all shared the caesar salad prepared table-side. It was seriously enough for all 4 of us, and it was very very delicious. I ordered the gumbo, and was very disappointed. I thought that gumbo would be Emeril's thing! It was slightly cold and WAY too salty. It was a nice little presentation though-- it came in a mini-pot and was poured into my bowl. \n\nI had the filet mignon and it was okay, and I wish I had ordered the duck. I can't really say why I only thought the filet mignon was only okay, but maybe it had to do with the fact that it was pretty salty too and I had just finished up a super salty gumbo? \n\nAll in all, it was a fun experience because of the atmosphere and because all of the family was there. Would we have had just a good of a time had we gone somewhere else? Probably. But, this was birthday girl's choice and it was kinda fun to go to a celebrity chef's place and criticize their food. :)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Best filet of my life! I'll be back. Grits were a bit undercooked, but the steak and mushrooms made up for the oversight. Amazingly attentive and friendly waiters.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Is there an email address I can complain to about my experience somewhere? For being the priciest place we ate at during my trip to LV, this was definitely the most disappointing. Service was incredibly aloof. The food was sub-par. \n\nFor 2 we ordered a few drinks, the Caesar salad and the Chateaubriand, both to share. The Caesar salad was delicious but how can you really go wrong with that? The main course was the absolute worst. Three pieces of meat per person, and it was barely lukewarm. I saw our server "heat" it up for maybe 3 seconds, and then take it off the grill. Although the meat was flavorful, the fact that it was almost COLD ruined the whole meal. Not only that, I asked our server to take a picture of us since it was my bday, and he handed over my camera to another server as if he was too good to take a damn picture!\n\nAt the end, we had a couple cups of coffee, and was given their birthday raspberry sorbet, which wasn't even edible. Overall NOT recommended.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I love Delmonico's, I really do.  But this past weekend, it just didn't measure up.  I should have gone with my gut and given CUT a try.  We started with drinks in the bar, which was fine.  Our table for seven was ready on time, which is always nice.  Unfortunately, our service was super average compared to what I've had in the past at Delmonico's and at other comparable high end steakhouses.  My husband and I shared a salad for an appetizer.  We let the server know this when we ordered and in the past, we've had this served on two separate plates in lieu of having to divide the salad at the table.  Unfortunately, we were given to salad plates and told we could split it ourselves.  \n\nI love a good filet, and unfortunately, my filet was very average.  It was cooked to my liking, medium rare, but it was served relatively cool, which made me think that our food was sitting for a while before it was served.  My mom ordered seared ahi tuna which was served completely cold.  The outer edges were completely cooled after the searing, which again, tells me that our food sat out for a while.  My husband and my brother both ordered bone-in rib-eyes.  When the food was served, they brought one rib-eye that had been split in two.  The server went back to the kitchen and they realized they made a mistake and brought out the other rib-eye, while using tongs to take the half from my husband's plate and added it to my brother's plate.  Rookie move, seriously.\n\nMy family doesn't eat a ton of cards, so for sides we ordered two servings of the mushrooms, broccoli, and corn for my niece.  The server kept pushing for us to order a starch, which we insisted we didn't want- very bizarre, it's not like we weren't running up a pretty hefty tab.\n\nIt was my mom's birthday and I really thought Delmonico's would come through with an excellent experience.  The food was okay overall, but I really can't say that this meal met my expectations or anyone at our tables' expectations.  I've been to many Emeril restaurants, maybe they went through a recent management change??  I don't know, I wish I could explain the extremely average experience.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Every single thing that we have tried here was above expectations. Had the filet mignon and Colorado rack of lamb with roasted fingerling potatoes and garlic mushrooms. The filet was oh so soft and the lamb was ever so juicy! Will come back here for yet another dinner splurge.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Dinner was fabulous. The bone in ribeye was perfectly done, the filet was blue as requested, not an easily done prep-and spit on. The grits, as well as the creamed spinach very tasty. The banana cream pie a perfectly yummy dessert for two. Well worth the price.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	What better place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and Yelp Spring Break than in Las Vegas! I wanted to surprise my bf so I made reservations through open table for dinner at Delmonico. When we arrived the hostess wished my bf a happy birthday and we were told to have a seat in the waiting room. Wow that waiting room was super nice but also packed! Lucky for us as we turned around to scan for a seat the hostess called my name and said our table was ready.\n\nUpon being seated we were greeted by our server. He also wished my bf happy birthday and took our drink orders. When the waiter returned with our water he also brought some warm, soft, honey rolls the melted in our mouths. We decided to start with the Petite Iceberg Lettuce Wedge salad followed by a Twice Baked Potato ($9) and Rib-eye ($48) for me and Short Rib Special ($35) for my bf. Before our salads came out the waiter brought a small appetizer for us to share- compliments of the chef. I don't remember what exactly it was but it was so delicious!\n\nThe wedge salad ($13) was composed with petite iceberg lettuce wedges and topped with apple smoked bacon and red onion with buttermilk blue cheese dressing. There was A LOT of crumbled blue cheese on the salad- almost a little too much for me. It was enough for both of us to share and enjoy before we got our steak knifes and forks ready for what was to come next.\n\nI wish I were hungrier at the time- my rib-eye was HUGE! After the rolls and salad my steak and bf's short rib looked almost impossible to finish and it was quite a challenge. The rib eye was thick, juicy and tender- served with a slice of melting butter on top. Every bite felt so sinful as it tasted so good despite how full I was I couldn't stop indulging in more. I tried my best to eat my half of the twice baked potato. It was really smooth and rich with bacon and Vermont cheddar.\n\nI can't say much about my bf's short rib since I was too busy trying to finish my ribeye. I know he really enjoyed it and the meat was so tender it fell apart with a light brush from his fork.\n\nAfter dinner the server brought my boyfriend a complementary scoop of banana sorbet for his birthday. He likes bananas but usually doesn't like banana flavored foods. The sorbet was so fresh and smooth he actually really enjoyed it and finished! With a food coma coming on and $115 later we postponed surprise #2 (dessert at Serendipity) and cabbed back to our hotel and called it a night. Who does that in Vegas!?!? \n\nP.S. I can't wait back to try the Creekstone Farms Naturally Raised Angus, Carved Tableside for Two with Asparagus and Garlic Smashed Potatoes. Time to start saving up again...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	As part of a birthday celebration weekend for two of my cousins, a group of us decided to head to Delmonico Steakhouse for a really nice birthday dinner. We had no idea what to expect of this place, except for the high prices. \n\nWe were running late for our reservation, but we called the restaurant letting them know we were on our way. It was a group of 6, so we really did not want to loose our reservation. They could not have been any more helpful over the phone! Directions were provided, and they kindly held our table until we arrived.\n\nUpon arrival, we were quickly escorted to our table. Our server kindly welcomed us and wished my two cousins a very happy birthday and memorable meal. After we all ordered our entrees, we were pleasantly surprised with complimentary appetizers for the entire group (halibut ceviche which was to die for!!). Their bread rolls were extremely delicious and always kept coming. Water was always replenished without even asking. Always a step ahead those people! When it came time to receiving our entrees, the wait staff made sure that all our orders were correct before setting them on the table. The dinner was then completed with complimentary sorbet (made in house). Everything was delicious!!! No one had any complaints about anything.\n\nThe service was excellent; above and beyond my expectations of any restaurant. I have been to other restaurants like Delmonico's at The Venetian for birthday celebrations, and none match the superb service and attention of Delmonico. Despite the fact that the restaurant's prices are high, the overall experience, taste of the food, and service make it an exceptional place for any occasion.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Long overdue review! Went back in July...and swore to myself I needed to give the place kudos because we had such a lovely experience. The food was delicious...and yes, it's a steakhouse, but I'd go back just for the banana cream pie. Oh...how I long for that pie. Anyway...the standout though has got to be the service. When our steaks came, I was disappointed to see that my steak had been overcooked - but it was clearly a busy night (and it looked like they had some crazy difficult customers that night), and I'm not usually one to complain, so I figured it still tasted good, and said nothing. But the manager, Ken, was nearby, and must've seen me sort of picking and inspecting my food, and he came by to make sure things were okay. I said they were fine, but he insisted on checking it out for me -- and in the end, even though I had already taken a few bites, he brought me a whole new steak and made sure it was cooked the way I liked before he left us to dine. That is fantastic service. \n\nFood was delicious, foie gras was heavenly (damn you California for banning it!), and the service top notch.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Amazing. From the service to the food. \nWe had reservations for 6 pm. And were seated almost as soon as we walked in. Everyone was friendly and our waiter was very knowledgeable with the menu. The bread and that butter with honey is amazing. \n\nI ordered steak, potatoes and broccoli and my bf ordered the ribs. \nWe both really enjoyed our food. Even the salad was amazing. \nWe will definitely we back when we R in town. \nBookmarked for the future (: I highly recommend this restaurant
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We had to come back here again on our most recent visit to Vegas. It was as good as we remember it. The lobster bisque, filet, and chocolate soufflé did not disappoint. The only minor complaint I have this time is with the cocktails. Too much ice and no garnish. For the type of restaurant it is, it should also not be using regular ice cubes from an ice machine. The drinks should not only taste good, but look delicious as well. \nI would not hesitate to come back here.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We ordered the Chateau Brian and it was awesome!  The steak cheese fondue is to die for.  Quality of beef was very good.  Service is good beside the fact that there is a huge party in front of us.  LOL.  One of the best steakhouse in Vegas I would say.  Will come back during slower, non-trade show time to experience better service.\n\nOut of all the fabulous restaurants this hold one of the top rank on my mind.  That's a lot to be said.\n\nNext time we're in Vegas we'll be sure make a stop here.  Make your reservation because this place is pack!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Screaming toddlers ruined it. \n\nWe have been coming here for a couple of years but tonight I couldn't believe that 1) they actually had high chairs and 2) people would be so inconsiderate to bring toddlers to this restaurant. \n\nThe food and service was impeccable as always but if you're paying $200+ for a meal you don't want kids banging silverware and having tantrums. \n\nWhile we love it here we will consider coming much later or somewhere else completely for a nice quiet adult dinner. \n\nDear parents, don't bring your kids here. Don't bring your kids to a casino. Disneyland is 3 hours a way. Go there instead.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Fantastic food, great service.  Much more expensive than what we usually spend on dinner, but so yummy and worth it!  We both had steak for dinner, with sides of salad in the sherry ving., garlic smashed potatoes, and the pecan pie.  I wish we had room to finish the pecan pie, but could only get through half.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	In Vegas a few nights seeking a great steak dinner. The petit filet mignon was yummy! Also a great individual portion, anything else simply too large. Dinner rolls the best !! Also the truffle pasta appetizer is a must try! Waiters provided good service too.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Food was amazing!! Portions were big (especially steak).  One of the better steakhouses in Vegas.  A bit pricey but at least the food is delicious!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The BEST steakhouse ever. The perfect amount of seasoning/flavor and a nice huge cut of perfectly cooked bone-in ribeye earns this establishment a 5 from me. every time I eat at a different steakhouse I always compare it to Delmonico's. Some other steakhouses in LV might hold a higher rating from "professional reviewers", but seriously, they don't hold a candle to this joint.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The decor is plain but that's not why you come here. You go to Delmonico for the great steaks, sides and yummy desserts. This place is almost always five stars for me but this last visit I made then mistake and deviated from my normal order of filet mignon and did the surf and turf special instead. The lobster was good (not sure if I would say amazing since it was slathered in bearnaise sauce) but the steak was only so-so; not up to normal Delmonico quality. Covering it in the amazing house steak sauce did help but I wouldn't recommend ordering the surf and turf.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I have been coming to this place for the last five years and it never disappoints.  One of my Vegas go to dining spots.  Visited last Thursday again.  A few favorites:\n\nArrive early and visit Max the Bartender.  Just recently learned he is a world class mixologist (after ordering wine for years) and will create beverages that will make your head spin.  Has his own bitters collection to add a custom touch.  Tequila Gumption he made me was world class.\n\nI always get the Filet Pittsburgh Style and it is exceptional.  Not too loaded down with butter and just the right flavor.  If I am steaked out, The Salmon dish is incredible.  Creamed Corn is to die for with jalapeno seasoning topping (I am hyper critical of creamed corn but thing D's and STK are two of the best).  Biscuits that they serve are out of this world.  Potato chips with truffle oil are a nice indulgence.  Caprese salad is a great starter.  Like the wine list and not over priced like Del Frisco and the Wynn or Bellagio spots.\n\nFinish it off with a double espresso and you are ready to venture on into the evening.\n\nI prefer to sit in the main room and the seating towards the back is preferred.  Lamont is the best server by far.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The best service I had was here during my time in Las Vegas. The al a cart sides were large enough to share family style. My filet was overcooked and the server had another one out to me in minutes. The martinis were wonderful in chilled glasses with blue cheese olives. The table settings beautiful.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Best meal EVER! (also the most expensive...but worth it).\n\nThe food was just unbelieveable. We had a special gnocchi/lump crab appetizer, wedge salad, filet & ribeye, roasted potatoes w/garlic, and pecan pie for dessert. Food coma! Everything was absolutely perfect and the service was excellent. Highly recommended for a special occasion.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Last night I had the salmon with a side of grits followed up by that he banana cream pie. It is amazing how good food can be! Just loved it. The food is pricey but if you want to give yourself a treat then this is the place to go.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I came for a restaurant week lunch with my two lovelies, Sandra and David and my husband joined before he headed to work. This 3 course was $30.15.\n\nThe 3 of us not working that day ordered beverages. This place made my heart sing because they had a Whisky BOOK. To be handed pages upon pages to browse on top of the other spirits, wine menu AND cocktail menus made my damn head spin because I wanted a lot of things. I settled on getting the Scarlet Starlet which had Glenmorangie 10, Tuaca, lime, hibiscus, strawberry and egg whites. It was totally up my alley - very much the scotch shined then the balance of the rest of the ingredients came through. Very much worth the $16 in alcohol and skill in mixing- the bartender Michelle was great.\n\nAppetizer I got VINE-RIPENED HEIRLOOM TOMATO SALAD (With Burrata Cheese, Red onion, Balsamic Vinegar and Torn Local Basil) which was standard, but good because the components were quality and fresh. \n\nEntree I got PAN ROASTED ATLANTIC SALMON( With Sweet Corn & Crab Vinaigrette and Fresh Basil) which was nicely cooked and was very fresh and clean. I liked the large pieces of lump crab mixed in with the corn. \n\nDessert the hubby and I shared:\n\nBANANA CREAM PIE PARFAIT(Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream and Graham Crumbs) was a solid dessert that could convince someone who doesnt like banana cream. The custard in it was creamy while still being light. \n\nTRADITIONAL BREAD PUDDING(With Warm Caramel Pecan Sauce) I love bread pudding and this was good, but average. I do appreciate that the caramel was flavorful while not being saccharine sweet.\n\nI thought it was a solid lunch, but I am coming back for drinks as there's very few places on the strip I've enjoyed the beverage offerings as this. Fantastic beverage program for the libation lover.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Five Star food and Five Star service! Fantastic beef and you have to try the banana pie!\nI know that every restaurant has a bad day, but some of the bad reviews I read are completely ridiculous. My guess is that either too much alcohol was consumed by people complaining and/or these reviews come from people that think food trucks are fine dining.\nPrices are very reasonable for the great food and service. This is a must try when visiting Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Minimalist decor, maximalist flavor!  the dry-aged ribeye steak was a marvel of cut and cure, and flawlessly prepared with a lump of butter oozing over the edges (as if the marbled steak didn't have enough cholesterol to make me reach for a double hit of pravastatin!) I generally order beef cooked medium-well which tends to dry out the meat; however the chefs here knew what they were doing and delivered the most fork tender medium well i have ever eaten!  The maitre'd oversaw the dining sequence and operation with panache, though the grim-faced waiters could have used a few lessons on how to develop an engaging personality.  The prices were reasonable for Vegas top flight restaurants.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great food, great staff.  Came for a steak, a steak is what I got.  Sides were amazing but not needed especially after my soup.  Never had to ask for water, never had to fill up my own wine glass.  Staff was excellent.  Knew before hand about dietary needs and overcame them.  I would defiantly recommend if you coming or stating near the palazzo.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	f you are going to eat here the only suggestion as mentioned before is to go with the Porterhouse. You will not regret it! At $85 the price is a bit of a turn off and there are other nice cuts available around a $50 range. Although, at 32 oz and being one of the best steaks I ever had in my life it was well worth it. Service was also fairly good although not superb. Very professional staff but during the busy dinner hours are not the most attentive.\n\nI made my reservations well in advance on the Venetian website and did not have to wait a minute to be seated.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I had better expectations for this place based on the reviews.  I ordered the bone in ribeye, which was touted as their "signature dish".  The meat was not well marbled and was quite gristly for the price.  The quality of meat was comparable to an Outback or Black Angus.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Such a disappointment!  Here in Vegas with family, we're all a bit of foodies and selected Delmonicos for its reputation as a great steakhouse.  We've dined at other Emeril restaurants and been very pleased, including another Delmonicos location.  The ambiance of the restaurant was considerably lacking.  You expect a steakhouse to have that rich dark woods atmosphere.  This was very bland and nondescript in a city that does things to an excess..  The steak, a bone in ribeye was good but not OMG.  Barbecue shrimp appetizer and popovers were delicious.  Side dishes including the Au gratin potatoes were fair.  Banana cream pie is a must have.  The freezing cold restaurant added to the disappointment.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Came back here with in a month just to show my wife the deliciousniss of the lobster bisque...it was just as good the 2nd time...too bad during lunch..they don't give the lobster as  a garnish as they do during dinner.  \n\nLunch service was ok...you can tell the difference from the dinner service.  But the food was good still.  I did want to try the lobster sliders....some one else go that and it looked pretty good...you get 2 sliders.  I had the pasta dish during lunch but the flavors was a bit bland and the dish was forgetable.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Service was great but being a steakhouse, I would have expected a lot better steaks! Table ordered 1 filet, 3 ribeyes and a New York - meat lacked seasoning, dry and 3 of the 5 were overcooked! Side dishes were okay. Best thing was the wedge salad! Definitely not a place I would return!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Best pecan pie ever!\nShrimp cocktail, good but nothing special, I thought it would be more Cajun. Oysters fresh and the horseradish was so good! Lobster bisque very good. The steak was pretty good I had a filet mignon and my husband had the Ribeye it was huge! Everything was cooked well. I have had a better steak but it was good. The best thing was the dessert of pecan pie. I'm just going to go there for that!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I usually only Yelp a location when I either have something negative to say (sad but true) or when I think I'm being witty. lol \n\nToday, for what I think is the first time, I'm Yelping because I'm just so incredibly impressed. EVERYTHING was delicious. Amazing. My husband got the bone in rib eye and I got the filet mignon.... so good. Sides were twice baked potato (better than my mom's, sorry mom) and cream corn. Literally some of the best food I've ever had. Great service too. \n\nExpensive, yes. But very well worth it. :)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	In my opinion it's not fit for a foodie. Meal was very good but not superb. However, service was great. I wasn't impressed by their BBQ shrimp which was highly recommended as their signature appetizer.  Fish was cooked perfectly but most of the food only had 2 dimensions.  I expected more complexity and excitement in their flavors. Overall great for a cocktail and a good meal but Las Vegas has so many places in this category. I would love a large well known restaurant on the strip to go above and beyond. \n\nIf you aren't adventurous and just want a good meal with all your great basics on the menu this is perfect. It's a crowd pleaser but definitely lacking in excitement. \n\nIf I were to rate the food it would only be 3 stars but the service is very good so I gave them 4 stars. I will be back for drinks but it wouldn't be my first choice for food.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I blame my father for my inordinate love of all things gourmet. Thankfully, I appreciate a good burrito as much as I appreciate a good steak, but I will definitely seize every opportunity to dine in style as much as I can.\n\nThanks to a family trip to Vegas, I got to eat at Emeril's, once more partaking our family's favorite pasttime: eating. We had eaten at the original location in New Orleans when I lived there, and it was one of my top 5 dining experiences of all time. This one definitely tied that experience.\n\nAs other people have said, if you're not going to eat steak in some form when you come here, you're wasting your time. The steak is truly a peak experience for meat lovers. We all ate our  steaks in silence, save for the "OMG!" and "MMMM!" and "wow.wow.wow."  They all had the filet mignon, and I had the bone-in dry aged ribeye: the best steak I have ever eaten in my life. It came on a bed of perfectly creamy garlic mashed potatoes and foie gras butter just melting into it. \n\nHave you ever had lightly tempura battered asparagus? It's worth coming here just to try them. \n\nEven the sides- delicious spinach he made without cream that was STILL good (shocking, I know), and broccoli cooked to perfection...we all kept remarking how absolutely everything was just perfect.\n\nThe other thing that distinguishes restaurants like this is the service.  Places like this are in a whole other league- waiters who seem to read your mind, appearing and disappearing before you even realized you needed something - never interrupting conversation, never hovering, always classy and helpful. Our waiter chose the perfect wine for us with with the vague descriptions of what we were looking for, and it truly was the best complement to our meals ever. \n\nThe design of the room is also a refreshing breath of fresh air from all the gaudy glitz and obnoxious 'bigness' of Vegas; simple, clean lines and understated elegance and chairs that make it seem like your table is totally self-contained and isolated from the other tables. Great to have that feeling of privacy.\n\nWe lingered for hours just basking in the glow of such perfection and decadence.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	He may be a TV celebrity chef, but you can't take away credit where credit is due: Emeril is a fantastic restaurateur.  My wife and I have dined here twice; the first time because we were staying at the Venetian and the second time we purposely came back to eat here on one of our anniversaries while staying in Vegas.  In short this is a fantastic formal steakhouse experience all around.  What sold us was the Chateaubriand for two. Expertly cooked and finished off by table side with a flame of cognac for that over-the-top Vegas style experience.  Quite possibly one of the most memorable steaks we've had in our life. Tender with an explosion of flavor when you take a bite, mmm.  There are several wonderful side dishes you can choose to complement the meat and so far we haven't been disappointed in any of them whether you go for the vegetable of the day (garlic pan fried green beans the last time were there) or the bacon and cheddar grits, mashed potatoes, or baked potato. Oh and for your prerequisite greenery before the meat course they also do a fantastic Caesar salad prepared at table side for 2 as well.  Desert? Yes please!  You can't go wrong with their caramel cream brulee but everything on their dessert menu looked sweetly decadent.  I don't think I need bother describing the wine or drink menu here other than this is Vegas after all and if you possibly couldn't find what you're after here to complement your meal then I'm sure they could get it for you.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went here for guys weekend. Unbelievable. Ravioli app was so good. The steak was very good too. When getting a good bottle of wine, make sure they decant it for you...had to ask.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is one of the most amazing restaurant I've ever had. I made a reservation for Fourth of July for my boyfriend's birthday. The service was 5 stars, my water was never below one sip level. We had three servers for our table. I've been waiting for their bone in ribeye as review said it was good. It was better than I expected. We had two appetizers beef cappacio and table side  Caesar salad, halibut, delicious! And caramel cake dessert was perfect. The servers had also given us a birthday banana walnut ice cream. Highly recommend this place!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Meh. Just .. meh. For the price we paid, I expected better food, and better service.\n\nAlthough my steak was cooked properly, my husband's steak was not. The service was slow and not especially friendly.\n\nHonestly, save your money - you can get better steak, better service, and better drinks at Ruth's Chris.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	One of the top steak places I've had in Vegas aside from STK and CraftSteak! \n\nMy friends and I started off with the steak tartare and truffle chips which were on point! It was shareable between the four of us and held us over until our steaks! They gave us complimentary bread that was so warm and slightly crispy....it was heavenly! \n\nI ordered the NYS, medium well and it came out perfectly cooked with garlic butter on top. The steak was huge and I was able to eat 3/4!! Honestly, all top steak places in Vegas taste the same to me due to the high quality meats they use but what I look for in these restaurants are the quality and taste in the sides and appetizers! \n\nThe sautéed mushrooms were seasoned perfectly and very tasty. The smashed potatoes were creamy and complimented the steaks very well! \nThe service was excellent; I highly recommend this place!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My wife & I dined here while we were in Vegas for a conference. With so many places to choose from we decided on Delmonico because it was in our hotel & we figured we couldn't go wrong at one of Emeril's restaurants. The dining area was very spacious & well decorated. The staff was very friendly and attentive to all our needs. I started with the wedge salad which was excellent. The bacon had a great smokey flavor & was crispy. The blue cheese was some of the best I ever had. My wife had the lobster bisque which was excellent as well. We the decided to try the Chateaubriand dinner for 2 which came with garlic mashed potatoes & asparagus. The meal is brought out and the meat is served table side. We ordered it medium rare & it was perfect for me. It had excellent flavor and was extremely tender. My wife would have preferred it to be a little more cooked in the center but she ate the outer pieces which for a little more well down but still tender & tasty. The potatoes & asparagus were both  perfectly cooked with great flavor. We passed on dessert because we were too full to eat anything else. I would highly recommend this restaurant & would eat there again when in Vegas!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We stayed at the venetian and as a very special treat had reservations for the hubby's birthday.  \n\nWe received warm friendly smiles as soon as we arrived and were quickly at our table for 4.  \n\nI ordered a Filet Mignon medium rare with country smashed potatoes.\n\nwe also had the best prepared Caesar salad ever to encounter my taste buds made table side.  \n\nThe steak just literally melted in my mouth.  I was in utter awe and in an orgasmic state.  With each tantalizing bite I felt I was being lifted into food heaven.  This was hands down the best Filet Mignon I have had thus far!\n\nOur Server was kind funny and on point.  The wine selection is impressive and we had our two bottles to the last drop:)  Hey we were celebrating remember(hubby's bday)\n\nI satisfyingly finished my meal off with a homemade sorbet\nThis will be a memorable moment locked away in my taste buds memory!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Our foodie friend Chung recommended us to this wonderful place. \n\nThis place is dark, it felt like eating in a rustic wine cellar. \nThe waiters are friendly.\nI ordered Bone in New York strip and Mr.Q ordered himself  Bone in rib eye.\nThe presentation of the steak looks poor, when I saw the giant portion of sizzling steak was drowning in the oil and come out in a hot plate.  I told myself " that couldn't be good". It made me changed my mind immediately after I took my first bite. It was juicy, meaty, tasty, tender and much much more. Wow! Amazingly tasty! The quality of the steak is really good. \nThe steak is d*mn good, but huge. I left half of it. What a waste of such beautiful piece, I wish I could bear a spandex tummy instead of wear spandex dress.\n\nThank you Chung for the wonderful recommendation and a wonderful happy tummy evening for me and Mr.Q.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had solo lunch at a table. The service here is some of the best I've ever encountered, hands down. Lunch may be a little more casual than dinner but there was no evidence of it in the level of professionalism. As time permitted, the staff really appreciated chatting about food and restaurants.\n\nI enjoyed the rich, super savory lobster bisque immensely. A meal in itself. The cajun salmon - featuring a nice salmon filet, french fried onions, and andouille hash - was prettty delicious. The best thing in this dish was the perfectly-cooked and seasoned salmon. While important to the overall combination, the cajun sauce was a little too gelatinous and as a result its sweetness was more cloying in my opinion. I thought had it been thinner it would have blended in more without overpowering with its texture. Overall the dish was very tasty.\n\nDelmonico's is extremely formal and professional but still has the makings of a fun place. I'd have to try their steaks to be able to really give it five stars.Reviewing other food in a steak place isn't completely fair.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Amazing.... wine is great from a wide range, great side dishes, and on-point steak/lobster! I had the steak and my wife had the lobster
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Steak Lover's motto: A steak cooked beyond medium rare is fit only for dogs.\n\nLike many a Vegas Steakhouse, I feel like the excitement and constant crowds provide easy business to this high-end restaurant and that easy patronage has caused them to rest a little on their laurels. \n\nThe service I received was adequate but not commensurate with the price level of this restaurant. The side dishes were very good. The steak was also very good, but at this price, it should have been exceptional. \n\nThe ribeye was very tasty. It obviously came from a happy, well-fed and fatty bovine donor. The unusual cajun seasoned rub was also a unique and complimentary twist. It was cooked to the requested temperature (rare), and it tasted great. My beef with their beef is simple: it could have been served with a hotter searing, on a hotter plate, and in a larger portion size. For the price, I expect a larger steak than this, and for that reason, I would probably go to Mastro's next time. \n\nThe meal was good enough that I would still go here again for another try if I get dragged along by other friends. We'll see how that goes. Till then, bon appetit!\n\n-The Beef Baron
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Amazing food, amazing service...loved the yorkshire pudding instead of bread!  Definitely, would recommend this location to anyone in Vegas!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A Las Vegas classic, great steaks, a nice rendition of the Manhattan original.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've been to this restaurant 3 times in the last 4 years.  The first time was amazing.  The bbq shrimp appetizer had big delicious shrimp, the steak was super tender and cooked just right and the service was impeccable, servers are there just when you want them and not more.  Also, the sommelier made an excellent wine suggestion that was reasonably priced.\n\nMy friends and I liked the place so much after the first time that we kept talking about going back the next time we were in Vegas.  The place was crowned as the place to go for our annual Vegas outing.  \n\nUnfortunately, the next two times I came back were utter disappointment.  The second time, I took my then fiancee.  We ordered the French onion soup, the BBQ shrimp and I had a rib-eye.  I forget what she had as an entree.  The French onion soup was gross, it tasted like dish water.  So we asked the waiter to bring us the Lobster Bisque instead.  It took us too long to find our server though.  To their credit, they took the french onion off of our tab.  The lobster Bisque was not special, very bland even for lobster bisque.  The shrimp came out very poor, the bbq sauce tasted burnt and the shrimp were small.  And to top the night off, my steak was medium well almost well done, when I had asked for medium rare.\n\nThe third time, I went with my friends.  The wine suggestion was poor and it was tres expensive.  Also, the food was just as mediocre as the second time I went.\n\nI give the place two stars despite the food being ok, because of the price.  Also, I think the service has gotten weaker since my first visit.  Hopefully, this place can get back into fighting form, but I won't know because I doubt I'll be coming back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I have been a big fan of emeril so I was excited to go... But I really wouldn't go back unless it was free. The best thing there was the service. The team that waits on your table is awesome. But for the food... The foie gras was good... The Caesar salad was okay, too much dressing but good flavor, the creamed corn tasted good but had too much breeding, the grits are not  grits... More like risotto. My husbands ribeye was only okay and for the price it should have been better. The macnut bread pudding and the banana cram pie... Stay away they are NOT good. And I think the most disappointing thing was the gumbo... It tasted like crap. I have been to the south and expected better gumbo from him.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The steak was delicious and the sides amazing defiantly worth the price and defiantly enjoyed my meal and experience. Service was excellent defiantly recommend.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I had a late-ish dinner around 9 here on Friday the 28th of July after seeing Phantom at the Venetian because the restaurant was close to the theater. I noticed there was a piano in the waiting room but no one was playing it; instead they were blasting the sportscast on the TV which soured the mood. Once seated the atmosphere was largely pleasant but also a bit too loud and some of the staff seemed uncertain and nervous. Our head server in particular was not enjoying himself at all and was visibly annoyed by the group across from our table which was loitering around the restaurant for a long time after finishing their meal. \n\nThe meal itself was very good, especially my Bone-in-Ribeye which is their signature cut. It's a slightly glazed and massive piece of meat, rubbed with a Cajun sauce that gave it zest and even a bit of spice. It paired beautifully with the Bourbon-Bacon Manhattan I ordered at the bar. My dining companion had the New York strip which was fine but not nearly as memorable as the Bone-in. Like the cuts of the meat, the sides are probably too big and one side is more than enough for 2 people. However both of the sides we had (The Wild Mushrooms and the Spinach) were delicious so it would be difficult to pick one. The appetizers were relatively standard, with the exception of the Parmesan-Truffle Chips but be forewarned that delicious as they are they are very filling and quite greasy.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Came here to eat dinner and everything for the most part was delicious. I got the bonein ribeye cooked medium rare. It was perfectly cooked and I was satisfied. It's pretty big but I still finished mines cause it was bomb. Ordered a bunch of sides too which were good. Nothing too special about them. However don't order the chicken my sister doesn't really eat red meat so she ordered it and it was dry. We ordered two desserts the banana cream pie and the butter cake. Both were good but the banana cream pie was exceptional! All in all it was a good experience and the food was worth the price
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I am a foodie.  I have watched many a show from Lagrasse.  I had expectations that were not made.  Service was great, ambience was good.  I had the petite lettuce wedge... ok.  I had the BBQ Salmon.  Was not impressed.  It was cooked to the stated level, cut of fish was good but the BBQ was not good and the sausage potatoe hash was lacking.  For the price of the dinner , it was not worth it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Outstanding lobster bisque and gumbo. Got a bit loud at times with large groups, but we enjoyed a delicious ribeye and filet. Both are good choices.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	It's been at least a year and half since i hit delmonico's - i wanted to try CUT but the person that invited me and was flipping the bill, chose the bam guy's steakhouse and since i was free loadin' - all good with me.\n\nate around 6 - started with a fat tire ale, then a sauvignon blanc - both hit the spot after the heated drive. ordered the bone-in rib eye with blue cheese melted on top - medium ( i believe it costs $52 - i didn't have my reading glasses - difficult to read ! ) twice baked potato,( $9) asparagus ($8)  and the gumbo of the day ( $10)\n\namuse buche - some sort of mushroom tapanade on a crostini - not bad !\n\nthe gumbo - ok - kinda dull - expected more heat \n\nthe steak - shear perfection - and with the blue cheese bubblin' and slightly browned -  B -  U -  T  - fulllllll\n\nthe sides - all decent \n\nthe group shared banana cream pie and banana bread pudding - GREAT !\n\nwe had 2 bottles of pinot noir - sonoma - could not read the name but it worked with the steak.\n\na meal like this is almost pushing me back into the rat race so i can enjoy the wining/dining i left behind when i retired.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I cannot believe this place is rated anything less than 5 full stars.\n\nI have eaten steak dinners that cost twice as much, yet they cannot touch the bone-in ribeye at Delmonico's.  NYC steakhouses are shamed by this Vegas institution.\n\nService has always been impeccable.  The sides and apps are great (I like the steak tartar), but the bone-in ribeye is the king of all steaks.\n\nI've been to Vegas twice and to Delmonico's twice.  It's the only place I insist friends visit when they go to Vegas.  It's better than craps or blackjack!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	WOW. This place did not disappoint. I had a pretty high expectation, especially after seeing 5 reviews (yeah out of 600+ lol) that said the steak might be better than Mastro's my most favorite steakhouse. \n\nBeing a true tubby at heart, I was the only one who ordered 2 appetizers lol. I had the BBQ shrimp (it's aight), wilted spinach & frisée (super delicious), and I tried the ravioli too (my friends loved it but it's aight for me maybe because I wasn't feeling like pasta). \n\nI had the Chateaubriand for my main and I lovvvveee the Creole seasoning on it. It was served with a huge handful of asparagus that looked really fresh and mash, which tasted delicious with the creole juice/sauce. My medium-rare steak was cooked perfectly and was super delish. Mastro's steak still wins though!\n\nWe also had a side of grits (good) and creamed corn (yummy). And for dessert, as usual we had a buffet of it. The best ones (in order): Bourbon bread pudding, pecan pie, espresso Creme brûlée. The chocolate cheesecake just wasn't my thing. My hubby also had their Blue Mountain coffee and he seemed to like it. \n\nI'm happy this is a chain (lol) because Delmonico is going to my regular/Yum Yum list!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I wanted to get a nice steak while in Vegas.  There were several options in Venetian/Palazzo alone.  I picked this one because, well, bam!  No but I figured a guy like Emeril Lagasse would make sure his steakhouse served a nice steak.\n\nThe decor inside is nice and clean, not a whole lot going on.  The opposite of a Red Robin, say.  Service was duly attentive.  Caesar salad prepared table-side was a treat.  \n\nWe went with cocktails over wine from the rather pricey and extensive wine list.  I didn't even eyeball the list personally.  But a generous portion of Bombay Sapphire satisfied nicely.  \n\nI went with a bone-in New York, medium-rare.  It was cooked expertly.  It had great texture and flavor, a nice creole seasoning rub on there but not too heavily applied.  The beef did the talking.  Or the mooing.  It was good.  Only ordered one side on account of a late lunch and we're not rich: mushrooms sauteed in butter.  I feared some pain old sauteed buttons would come out.  But I was rewarded.  A hearty mix of flavorful 'shrooms, like oyster and chantrelle and maybe porcini or shiitake came out.  Lovely.  And buttery.  and Garlicky.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	How can you screw up on Boned in New York twice? Come to Delmonico's.  Medium means Well Done.  No pink what so ever.  And they even cooked two steaks. \n\nIs your steak fine? After all your friends have eaten? Yes.  It's fine because I don't want to wait around for you to screw up anymore.  \n\nOnly saving grace was the bourbon.  \n\nBasically, screwed up on steak.  Luke warm coffee.  Oh hell, might be a bad night, but my five other friends had good dinners.  Didn't want to bitch and spoil their evening.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We expected much better. The design of this restaurant is great, the service is great but the steaks are not great. They started us with a complimentary thin slice of cucumber topped with tiny lentils, a tasty tidbit. We then had the lobster bisque which was very good with large chunks of lobster in it. My husband had the bone- in NY strip,medium rare, it was grizzly and very chewy, not worth a price tag of $50. I had the petite Piedmontese filet mignon, 6oz., although extremely small for $50.00 it was very good. We were then given a small scoop of complimentary blood orange sorbet and finished the meal with the pecan pie, good but not memorable. With all the steakhouses in Vegas we have no reason to return here.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Very good food! You have to try the banana cream pie. It is awesome! I had the bone in rib eye and it was delicious even though it was pretty fatty. The price is very high so come prepared to spend some $$$.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Enjoyed the service typically expected for a nice Vegas restaurant.  I ate the rib eye steak cooked medium and was mouth watering.  The portion was big which I had to take home.  The environment is great for a dinner party, but may be loud for a date (we dined on a Wed night).
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Fantastic meal and service. I had the filet mignon and my husband had the BBQ salmon. We each ordered a salad (mine the organic greens and his the heirloom tomato and cheese--superb!) and shared the creamed corn. Thank you for the delicious New Years Day meal. We will not forget it and highly recommend coming here for a nice dinner out. .
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Excellent steakhouse !!! Food amazing !!! Service 5 star !!! Not much to say just must visit and you'll see ;-)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Five star service the bone in rub eye was a good size and so favor full and tender that I ate the whole thing , the strawberry shortcake was unbelievable . Unlike anything I had before, my wife loved her scallop and macadanina bread pudding. In fact. It was the olmy bread pudding I liked
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	5 starts (I highly recommend)\n\nDelmonicos earns a five star rating for two reasons.  For one, I've never had a bad experience eating there... Their food and service has always exceeded my expectations.  Secondly, their Pan Seared Foie Gras literally took my breath away because I was enjoying it so much I damn near forgot to breath.  That is saying a lot because normally I don't like liver!  For a quick recommendation, try their filet mignon, duck or ask for their filet medallions, it is off the menu but the flavor is amazing.\n\nFor a full review read my post at:\nhttp://foodilistic.com/reviews/delmonicos-las-vegas/
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	bone in rib eye steak is the popular choice it's corn fed rather than grass fed (piedmontese = italian leaner import).  overall solid with flavor and cooking temp although some were not pleased
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	First time here and I will be back!\n\nI made reservations a week before on their website and asked for a nice table.\n\nMy party of 4 arrived early, but no problem- they had our table ready for us!\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon ($65) and had the following:\n\nI ordered two appetizers for my entree:\n1. Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad with Burrata Cheese, Red Onion, Extra\nVirgin Olive Oil, Balsamic Vinegar and Torn Local Basil.\n- I was a little sad that the Burrata cheese was so small compared to the heirloom tomatoes, but it was delicious!\n\n2. Butternut Squash Ravioli with Sage Brown Butter, Toasted Hazelnuts and Parmesan\n- OMG!  SO GOOD!  The squash was divine.  I would definitely order this again.\n\n3. Grilled Marinated Organic Chicken Breast - Roasted Fingerling Potatoes, Whole\nGarlic, Wild Mushrooms and Natural Reduction\n- The person that ate this said that the chicken was cooked perfectly and had really good flavor.\n\n4. Filet Mignon w/ a twice baked potato (with Bacon and Vermont Cheddar) and a Caesar Salad.\n- He said that the steak melted in his mouth!\n\n5. Surf & Turf- bone in ribeye and crab & buttered Fresh Asparagus, I believe. (I don't see it on the menu, so it must be a special)\n- My husband cleaned his plate.\n\nWe also ordered two desserts:\n1. Delmonico Chocolate Layer Cake - Chocolate Pudding, Coconut Ice Cream and\nToasted Almonds\n- Looked delicious.  They said it was good and the coconut ice cream was amazing!\n\n2. Pecan Pie with Oatmeal Shortbread Crust French, Vanilla Ice Cream & Caramel Sauce\n- Pie was in the shape of a circle, so the center was ooey and gooey and yummy!!  Very good!\n\nPrice was about $300+ for the table (not including tip).\n\nThe service was OUTSTANDING!  We actually had 3 people waiting on us and never had to ask for anything.  They were on-point with re-filling the water at the table!  It was SO nice to never have to look around for someone to help us.  The timing of everything was beautiful.\n\nWe even got an amuse-bouche bruschetta when we were deciding what to have for dinner.  What a nice surprise!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The entire experience was phenomenal!  From the staff, food presentation (loved the table side preparation of our Caesar salad), and of course the flavor of the food. We would absolutely return for another dinner.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Of all steakhouse experiences, this is the best. I have enjoyed many steaks at Delmonico Steak house. Tonight was perfect. \nI enjoyed a New York strip served Piedmontese. My steak was cooked impeccably. Executive Sous Chef Ivan Rojas prepared a meal my wife and I truly appreciated. \nWe have been customers here for 5 years now. \nI was raised in the restaurant industry, and I truly appreciate the effort involved to create our meal.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My family went here for Fathers Day at noon. The place had a very nice atmosphere. We sat two minutes after checking in.  Five minutes later, a waiter approached us and took our order for drinks. He introduced himself and another waitress. We got our drinks and ten to fifteen minutes later, a different waitress gave us bread.  A person in a suit then approached us to ask if we were ready to order. We replied, "Yes".  He then walked away instead of taking our order. I would assume that he is the manager.  A different waitress then approached us to Finally take our order.  This took more than half an hour from the time we sat down.  Sad thing was that the table behind us sat after we did and was already eating their appetizer before someone took our order.  Mind you, we sat before several customers and they were attended to first. Very very poor start of customer service.  I would think that this place would have excellent service consistently.  Another, I had black slacks on. I placed the napkin on my lap, and behold the napkin left tons of white lint on my black pants.  I went to other restaurants in Vegas and I was offered a black napkin to use instead.  Others, the napkin did not leave as much lint as this one did. I ordered the lobster bisque, which was excellent. Creamy, smooth, and a lot of flavor.  I also ordered the filet medallions.  It had panko breading which I really didn't care for.  The bacon was charred and hard, but the two filet medallions were great.  It also had a simple sauce with small mushrooms. My dad had the lobster sliders.  The sliders were surprisingly great according to my dad.  They didn't skimp on the lobster.  Instead of shredded pieces, they are a generous portion in the sliders.  The bread they offered got cold pretty quick but it was still good to eat.  At first, drinks were coming in slow. Then the waiters paid more attention to us in the end.  The restroom was located all the way in the very back.  I thought I had to exit the building itself to use the restroom.  You have to through a very long hallway to the very back towards the exit sign.  The sink was shallow and I could barely wash my hands in it since it's so shallow that my hands will get wet from the dirty water in the sink.  There was only one sink available.  Food would have been excellent.  Service was mediocre.  I'm not sure I would return here if I have this kind of service.  It was my first time here.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delicious steak house! I will recommend you make reservations and come with a healthy appetite! This place is top notch. The decor is romantic and comfortable. I would definitely tell you truffle lovers to order the truffled potato chips. I promise they won't disappoint. In regards to the meat, it's comparable to any wonderful steakhouse I've ever been to. The service was phenomenal. This is a place I will definitely be returning to, it's a gem on the strip !
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great ribeye steak.  Cooked perfectly.  Was a little disappointed in the "sides".  Overall good experience but would probably choose Bouchon 1st.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We had a great experience at Delmonico.  Great food, wine and service made for a great meal.\n\nWe started with bbq shrimp and ahi tartare.  The bbq shrimp is New Orleans style which is shrimp in gravy rather than a typical bbq and it was very tasty.\n\nThe gumbo was good and had a bit of heat, great stuff.\n\nMy bone-in ribeye was cooked to medium and had a creole rub that was delicious.\n\nMy son had a huge, huge cheeseburger that was very tasty.  \n\nThe service was prompt, attentive and courteous.\n\nI grew up in Texas, so I know a good steak when I see it.  The bone in ribeye served here is fantastic.\n\nExpect to spend at least $100/person when dining here, you don't get a great meal here on the cheap...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Overall, this is a good option for a high-end steakhouse.\n\nI order the filet mignon medallions and they were incredible. \n\nThe turn-off for me was the service.  Super slow service and I felt that we were at times treated like second-class citizens.\n\nOh well!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I had dinner here couple weeks ago with all my team members from work, party of 7. Everything that we ordered was great and it's like you can't go wrong with all the dishes.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I have to say that my steak which was the ribeye on bone was tasty.My friends steak being the kobe steak, was dry. Not what i expected for a Kobe steak. But considering that mines was good, I give it 4 stars. Kobe steak 3.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Came here with my family on a Saturday evening over a holiday and got seated right away. The atmosphere itself was nice and the restaurant wasn't very busy, but one of the first things I noticed was that it usually took a lot more effort than I would expect at a nice restaurant that wasn't crowded to begin with to get our server's attention. The servers themselves were great and always helpful but just seemed to be pretty absent most of the night.\n\nThe food itself was very good. The pre-dinner rolls were light, which I liked so you didn't get too full on bread before your actual meal came. I ordered the BBQ Salmon. A lot of other plates at our table were the rib-eyes. Everything was cooked perfectly, and my only complaint might be that the salmon was really heavy on BBQ sauce. Portions were large enough to be worth the price, but it really depended on the items ordered.\n\nOverall 5 for food, 3 for service.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This was a great venue to have some dinner and enjoy the company of friends.  Located in restaurant row in the Venetian, this place is an Emeril restaurant that features steaks and sides of high quality.  \n\nA few of my party actually shared the rib eye because it was a really bit cut of meat.  That combined with the great sides made a wonderful meal.  Service was impeccable as our waiter and other staff were engaged and always on top of what we needed.\n\nFor sides, I'd suggest the grits and bacon.  I ate the whole side dish and barely shared with others.  The creamed corn was surprisingly good and the brussels were also really good.  For dessert, we had the strawberry shortcake which came in a jar which was terribly good.  We also had the chocolate cake and key lime pie.  I didn't try too much of that as I was stuck digging my spoon in the strawberry shortcake. \n\nFor a great balance of food and service, I highly recommend.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Everything was good but not great except the steak!\n\nWe ordered the Chateaubriand, which was very tender, juicy and lean.  Quality was so closed to Wagyu.  I really had that Emeril's BAM feeling after the first bite.\n\nLobster Bisque and Gumbo tasted above average.\n\nCreme Brulee was average.\n\nOn the side note, this restaurant was unusually noisy, don't know why.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Outstanding!! Service - Perfect!! Food - Excellent and large portion size!  Clean & Elegant.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I'm so sad that my boyfriend and I were foolish enough to eat a huge lunch leaving us unprepared for the awesomeness of this place. We were staying in The Venetian with a group of friends and decided on a good steak dinner. As mentioned, my boyfriend and I were still stuffed from lunch so we went for the Cesar salad for two and each got a potato on the side. The salad was so fresh and delicious, and made right at the table. The potatoes were almost too big but delightful. Everyone at the table had what looked to be an amazing steak, the one bite I stole was heaven.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Wow, I can't believe this place getting 4 stars. BAM to POOF to me.\nFirst off the bread ... if you do not know now to make a simple bread ... how hard it is ... even my homemade bread taste better than that hard piece of rock they served. \nMaybe it was just a bad day for me. But it cannot be that bad right. nooo ... but sorry to say ... it is a yes for me.\nWaiter ... service ... zero! rude and didn't ask if we are done and took everything away ... but the food was bad anyways take it away as fast as you can.\nJumbo shrimp and petite fiilet mignon ... non fresh shrimp made for bad combo plus ... I ordered medium rare and it came out well done. hmm ... either the waiter doesn't know how to write his order or the head chef or whoever is cooking is just as bad as emeril lagasse himself. \nThen to coffee ... argh ... disgusting ... and we were like complaining and the waiter came by and asked ... we can brew a fresh one for you??? ... i was like WTF ... this was not a fresh brew to began with ... argh disgusting and chills all over my body ... so time to get out pronto!!!\n\nThe only good thing that came out of this is the wine we ordered ... they have an extensive selection and kudos for that ... \n\nBut I am never going back ... $55 for the entree ... I rather go to McD and I know what I am getting for $5.50.\n\nThank you Dad who said that my cooking with a costco steak is better than whatever they whipped up at demonic ... haa haa.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The best steak I've had so far.. Very good service and the bread was delicious!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great meal, would be excellent but I had to send my steak back for a little more cooking (I said medium to well and it was more on the medium side - I am a bit picky with that).\n\nThe service was perfect, however. Didn't have to wait long for anything, and I really like that the whole table is served at the same time, it's a nice subtle touch. Very attentive and friendly service.\n\nI enjoyed the experience and was not disappointed even going in with a high expectation.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Everything about this place was amazing.  The food, the service, the ambiance, it couldn't have been better.  We began our meal with bbq shrimp, bone-in bacon, and lobster bisque, all of which were delicious.  Now on to the steaks. We ordered bone-in ribeyes and this was by far the best steak I've ever had. It was perfectly prepared and the flavor was out of this world. For our sides we ordered sautéed mushrooms and grits, both of which were equally delicious.  We finished our meal with dessert and we ended up with two, the pecan pie and the caramel butter cake, both of which were, you guessed it, delicious!\n\nLet's talk about the staff and the service.  From the host that greeted us when we walked in, to the gentleman that walked us to our seats, to the three gentlemen that served us, everything and everyone was absolutely delightful.  The three gentlemen serving us were Rene, Brian, and David, and they ran like a well oiled machine.  They were very attentive and very pleasant people, and they helped make our dining experience so wonderful. \n\nThe ambiance was perfect for our early xmas dinner.  We had a table where we were able to comfortably eat dinner, have a conversation without screaming at each other, and we weren't wedged between other people being forced to share our dining experience with strangers. \n\nDefinitely a five star establishment with five star food and five star service. We will definitely be back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place is where  you want to go. The food  is excellent.  I got the dry aged , wet aged bone in ribeye steak. It melts  in your mouth its so tender. The reason I say this is the place  you want to go is because  the service is as good as the meal.\nYour not stretching your neck  looking  for your server.  Water glasses were always  full and our steaks all landed  at the same time  by 3 servers.\nThey have a seamless flow to the meal. If you haven't  been here please treat yourself
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico's is a great place to dine while staying in Vegas (especially if you are staying at the Venetian).  \n\nService:\nThe distinguishing characteristic here is the service.  We had 10:00pm reservation on Valentine's day and were flying in to Vegas to meet friends for a weekend getaway (got that? good).  Our flight out of SFO was delayed and we ended up arriving at the restaraunt at 10:48, long after we should have been seated etc.  Our waitress was the essence of efficiency; without missing a beat she let us know that last orders were due at 11:00.  They key here was she always made us feel like she was on "our team" rather than making us feel as if our lateness at created an inconvienience for her.  She helped all six of us get seated and get our orders in "before the bell" (as it were).  She got a $100+ tip for being a pro.\n\nFood:\nThis is a steakhouse, order a steak.  Mine was flavorful without being fatty or gristly, pink without being bloody and just the right amount charred on the outside.  This was the ribeye steak, but the bone-in ribeye ordered by one of my partners in crime was equally well-prepared and duly appreciated.  My wife thought her crab-stuffed halibut (wrapped in a potato skin) was good (but not great?).  \n\nCost:\nYou won't find an entree for under $50 and the sides are extra (we had a group of 6 so that actually worked out wonderfully and we ended up dining quasi-family-style).  The asparagus and mushrooms were hits!  With tip (21%), the bill came to exactly $100/person.  I think we all had at least one drink and the girls split a bottle of wine, one desert and a few coffees were ordered.\n\nBottom Line:\nThe service here was friendly and professional.  The staff make you feel welcome and are eager to please.  The food is extremely good and a decent value (it is Vegas after all).  Go here if you like steak and are willing to pay a little extra.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A 5  rating for a 5 restaurant. Located in between the beautiful Palazzo and Venetian Hotel, this restaurant and their staff truly were amazing. From the moment we walked in, every staff member was attentive to our needs. They truly took care of us (party of 7), the waiter was amazing and truly enjoys his job. The food was amazing! Everyone enjoyed their meals and salads/soups. We had a slight small incident with my mom who slipped as we were walking in, and every couple of minutes the manager in charge, Tyler, came and checked on my mom several times. Despite the fall, the restaurant is amazing, we were happy we choose DelMonicos for our dinner!! Keep up the great job!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Excellent service! Our waiter Frank was wonderful! We typically eat at Mastro's...boy 'am I glad we came here! My halibut entree was excellent! The sides were delicious! Highly recommend!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Bone in ribeye was incredible. Even offered a special "book" of scotch selections.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Food was excellent and drinks were okay. We had the ribeye (boneless) and ahi tuna and salmon with the BBQ shrimp appetizer. Added cream of corn (excellent!) and spinach (bland) and had a great dinner. Staff was accommodating and pleasant but a bit formal for our taste. We had a short wait on the front end of our visit but all in all very good.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	So, I've always thought Emeril was a lot of talk and no action, but I was wrong to judge without experiencing Emeril's cooking. \n\nOn our first night in Vegas, we made last-minute reservations for 9:30.   The restaurant is in kind of a weird place.  It's literally in the corner of the basement.  Granted, there are restaurants next to it, it still felt like it was at the edge of the earth.   Inside is relaxed.  It's dimly lit and the ceilings are low (again, more basement feel), but overall, it's very nice.\n\nWe were starved, so we went right to the entrees, but they were delicious.  My boyfriend, the meat-eater in the group, had the filet, which he claims is the best cut of filet he has ever had.  He says it was cooked to perfection and it was absolutely perfect.  And, he's had quite a few steaks.  I had bacon-wrapped sea bass with pesto, roasted tomatoes, and some potato goodness, that I can't remember.  I mean, in all honesty, I wasn't expecting to be impressed, so I didn't pay much attention to the intricacies of the dish.  But, it was amazing.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the flavors were a perfect compliment to each other.  It was perfect.  \n\nAnd, for dessert, we shared the banana cream pie, which I knew was legendary, and quite frankly, it was the only thing that disappointed me.  It was good, but I think I expected more.  Regardless...this was a great meal, and well worth every penny.\n\n5 stars for food, minus one for weird location and ambiance.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Another large group dinner with the co-workers, this time we selected Delmonico Steakhouse.  Wow, I am impressed.  This is what I call classy.  I didn't even realize this was an Emeril Lagasse restaurant until I examined the doggie bag afterward!\n\nThe food is top notch, I ordered the butternut squash ravioli (sans duck confit) and the wild arugula w/ raspberries.  Both dishes were just the right size (not too big, not too small), beautifully presented, perfectly seasoned and dressed, and absolutely delicious.\n\nWe ordered and shared the green apple crisp a la mode for dessert, I might have loved it more if I was still hungry, but I was so stuffed that I couldn't properly enjoy it.  Note to self: next time, dessert first!\n\nLiterally, there was not a single bite leftover from anyone's plate.\n\nIn regards to the service, our server Jen was such a sweetheart, she seemed like a friend right from the start.  Not too intrusive, but relaxed and attentive.  Very accommodating and down to earth.\n\nMust try items: Homemade potato chips with parmesan, truffle oil and scallions.  I was stuffing my face like no tomorrow and scraping the plate clean...The warm dinner rolls w/ butter...They smelled SO buttery!  Lastly, the corn gratin, the panko topping was so crispy, it was unreal, the gratin underneath was hot, steamy, and sweet from the crisp fresh corn.  SOOO GOOOD!\n\nAll in all, this place was expensive, but none of the staff had to overdo it to impress us, the atmosphere, food and service spoke for itself, so it was worth every penny.\n\nLOVE
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I go to this restaurant every time I go to Vegas, which in my line of work is about 4 times a year. The food and service can't be beat. Now, in a fairness it is one of those she she places where everything is rediculously over priced and gives you that feeling of "do i make enough money to eat here" lol Its all an act and at the end of the day, it really is a fantastic place to eat!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Hands down, the best meal I've ever had.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were 20minutes late to our reservation, but they stil accommodated us within 2minutes after getting there. We had THREE servers: one for wine, one for food, and one for.. I don't even know, just to make us feel like royalty!\n\nWe ordered the bone-in rib-eye and the filet mignon. Although the bone-in rib-eye is the most popular steak at the restaurant, my personal favorite is the filet mignon just for its AMAZING tenderness. I'm really bad at describing taste with words, so all I will say is this: perfection. And you HAVE to pair the steaks with the house red wine. It transformed our meal even more.\n\nAnd for dessert, we got the banana cream pie.. and I wanted to cry. That honestly the best way for me to describe my experience. I took one bite, and wanted to cry. "It was the best tasting dessert I had ever had in my life" is an understatement.\n\nFinally, I loved the look of the restaurant. It wasn't as dimly lit was I thought it would be, which I actually was pleasantly surprised about because I'm tired of not being able to see my food. The design is very minimalist but still very sophisticated.. but not TOO sophisticated that regular folks like my boyfriend and I didn't feel out of place.\n\nAlthough it was incredibly expensive, the food and the overall experience was so incredible that even my boyfriend, who can be pretty frugal sometimes, said that Delmonico's HAS to be a place we go back to EVERY year. I can't wait for the next time. :)
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place is perfect. Love eating here. Its my top pick for steak in Vegas. I try to go every time I'm in town. Love the bone in ribeye. Lots of good drinks to. Its a must.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	More like 2.5 stars.\n\nCame in for a late Friday night dinner. Started with martinis - awesome.\n\nMy wife and I both ordered filets cooked medium. The steaks came out super fast and were unfortunately super rare. My wife decided to eat hers, but I sent mine back. My steak came back closer to medium rare than medium, and the flavor was gone. I waited at least ten minutes for the steak to come back, and it was a miss. On top of that, my filet's cut was poor. The sides were fine - mushrooms and twice baked potato.\n\nI kind of felt that the kitchen and management really blew this for us. At a place with a price point like this, walking in just before closing shouldn't impact the food quality. I feel like the kitchen wanted the steak out ASAP so they could shut down for he night. On top of that, no manager came to say a word about the mistake, and nothing was done to compensate for it - no comped drink or dessert or even a "sorry" from the management. I think that this is inexcusable considering this is an Emeril restaurant and is quite pricey.\n\nNot sure we will return, which is too bad because we are fond of the place from past visits.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Before I went to this place, I checked some reviews which were mostly positive. First, staff was very courteous and decor was simple and inviting. One thing I noticed was there were way too many employees waking and standing around and it was very distracting at times. As for the food, other than the Bone in Ribeye steak which was decent considering the portion and the price, everything else was a real disappointment. I got better lobster bisque at Lobster ME next door for $4, I mean A Lot BETTER. Their soup was awful.\nI really wanted to like this place considering it was our wedding anniversary but it was a real letdown.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Simply delicious. I had the pork chop and my coworkers dived into the steak. Everything was so tasty, cooked to perfection. Definitely one of the better steakhouses I've dined in. Will definitely be back for more
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I did the 2012 Restaurant Week $30.12 lunch special here which was a pretty good deal for a 3-course meal at an Emeril Lagasse restaurant inside the Venetian.  \n\nFive stars for participating in Restaurant Week and donating a portion of proceeds to Vegas' Three Square charity, having excellent food, friendly and professional service.\n\nSlight demerit for having nice but very plan decor (ceilings/walls pretty much barren), but I care more about food than the eatery/setting anyways.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I'll start out by saying the service and environment were both great.  Delmonico seems to draw a good balance between those hyper-formal restaurants where utensil etiquette matters and more casual fine dining restaurants. \n\nI tried the foie gras and octopus appetizers.  The octopus was delicious and had a decent amount of meat.  The foie gras was rich.  I followed these with the gumbo which had a mild spiciness that anyone should be able to enjoy.\n\nThe disappointment occurred during the main course.  Three of the people in our party ordered the filet mignon.  Two of us were immediately dissatisfied with the plate.  I had ordered medium-rare and my dissatisfied friend had ordered theirs rare. My filet was noticeably dry and neither were especially tender. I suspect mine may have been overcooked because the third filet was also a medium-rare and the butter on top of their steak was still present, whereas mine had altogether melted by the time the plate reached our table.    Additionally, whatever seasoning was used for my filet was not spread evenly.  There was only one bite where the seasoning became obvious and it overwhelmed the flavor of the meat.\n\nFor a steak that costs over $50 at an establishment that is a steakhouse, I hold it to certain standards, like being appreciated by a majority of the people at my party who ordered it. I can understand one person not enjoying their steak at a table because they have specific preferences, but for two people at the same table to be dissatisfied makes me believe the quality of the cooking is unreliable.  I have definitely cooked better steaks than the ones I tried  during this meal, and unfortunately this is the first steakhouse I have been to where that has been the case.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I took my wife and daughter here during spring break. Whow. We each ordered a different kind of steak. Each came out exactly as ordered and at exactly the same time! The steaks were a lot bigger than expected and we had to ask for doggie boxes. (We finished it off the next day!) Great wine selection. Great service.\n\nMy only complaint is the table are too close together and if the people next to you do not bump you, the waiter does as he passes between tables. That was a real pain. They need to rearrange the seating. Ask for a corner table to avoid this problem. If they fix that, I would give them five stars.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We went on Christmas Day, so had a few specials. Started with they oysters - very good. Then a duck salad. The duck was rich but was cooked right. It's extremely hard to cook good duck, but they nailed it! Then I got the filet minion, medium rare. It melted in my mouth. It was amazing. It may have been more on the rare side, but I had no complaints. To finish off my experience I got the bread pudding. Just like the filet, amazing. The pecan buttered ice cream and the warm bread was bigger than it looked - but had no problem finishing it. In our group of 3, we each got a different menu item - I feel like what i got trumped the other dishes. Try it!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	While on an extended stay at the Palazzo we decided to try Delmonico. I made a reservation through Open Table. We were seated promptly but at a table that was less than desirable where the waiter had to stand behind me while serving us. He was quite pushy and brusque. My wife ordered the half duck as she loves duck. Right after we were served the waiter returned and asked if everything was OK, My wife had taken one bite from the duck leg and she said that things were OK. But as she continued to work on the rest of the duck it seemed to become very tough like it had been over microwaived. She signaled the waiter over and rather than handling it professionally he asked in a rather accusing manner why she had said the duck was OK when first asked. This made us feel very uncomfortable. The waiter did remove the duck and did not charge us for it. However, we just wanted some excellent food. I'll never return to any of Emeril's restaurants based on this encounter. If you want a good meal while at the Venetian / Palazzo go to Bouchon where you'll be treated well and the food is great. Just to be balanced I will say that the rib eye that I had was good.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My 4th time going to the restaurant and it didn't disappoint. Made reservations for 9pm but I forgot where it was. Made the mad scramble for 2 blocks. When I called the woman who answered said no problem. The bartender was exceptional, stearing me towards a good whiskey. Of course the steak itself. To describe the steak would only cheapen the experience. Very worth the money.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Top notch steaks and one of the best wine lists in Las Vegas. Perfectly seasoned and prepared steaks in the main dining room makes for a great night out, but what makes The Delmonico Steakhouse a DESTINATION is their individually planned and prepared tasting menu, available during an evening at their special Kitchen Table. \n\nThey have a glass room with space for 8, connected to the kitchen where you'll enjoy a special tasting menu prepared by the Chef on duty. And when I say special menu, I mean just that. Chefs are passionate about menu planning and specialty food and they'll give you a 6-8 course meal featuring the steak of course, and many other things not available on their menu, finished with a dessert tray to die for, featured every one of the desserts they offer. \n\nThis is an Emeril restaurant but you won't see any made for TV dinners here - it's truly an authentic steakhouse with an upscale dining room. For the wine lover, Master sommelier Kevin Vogt will work with the chef to perfectly pair wine with each course. What is special, as of my last visit, is The Delmonico Steakhouse runs independent of the other food services at The Venitian. This means they shop for their own food and manage their own wine collection. So if you enjoy fine wine, perfectly paired with your meal - this is the place for you. \n\nThis is my #1 all time favorite restaurant. The food is good enough to stand on its own, and because of the special treatment you get at the kitchen table, I've yet to experience anything so great.\n\nHow much? You'll be shocked and surprised to learn this dining experience isn't terribly expensive. For a little more than you'd spend in the dining room, you get a personal dining experience, about $85 for dinner and wine pairing for about $65.\n\nI call this a once in a lifetime experience, even though I've been lucky enough to do it about ten times.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Never get between a girl and her BONE-IN RIBEYE....NEVER!\n\nWhen deciding on restaurant for my friend's BIG 3-OH B-Day dinner, it was between CUT, N9NE, and Delmonico's. After YELPING and looking over all the menus, Delmonico's was the winner because it was conveniently located in The Venetian (we were staying at the Palazzo), decently priced compared to CUT, and had rave reviews about the bone-in ribeye. \n\nRESERVATIONS: \nMaking reservations was quick and simple. You can make reservations directly through the restaurant as opposed to The Wynn Restaurants where you have to call their restaurant hotline number and the wait is 20+ minutes.\n\nOn Friday, March 4, 2010, our party of 9 arrived around 7:15 PM. As we were escorted to our table, we couldn't help but notice the shape of our table. A round table was connected to a rectangular table which errr, resembled a male part. Don't know if it was intentional since I told them it was my male's friend's b-day party? Anyhow, it made for a good laugh. \n\nFOOD:\n*Lobster Bisque ($12.50): Rich, velvety smooth with generous chunks of sweet tender lobster equals YUMMYNESS! The only complaint is it was a bit too salty for my taste. Four of my friends also had the bisque and complained about the same thing.\n\n*16 oz Bone-in Ribeye ($52): One word...WOW! The bone-in ribeye, aged for 8 weeks was one the most flavorful steaks I've ever tasted! The ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare with nice charred crust and a pink center. You can tell that the marbling slowly melted and basted the meat during the cooking process producing a rich, amazingly tender, and savory cut of meat. Aside from the Kobe from Craftsteak, this is hands-down the best steak ever; and for the price point, you really can't go wrong. If there weren't anyone watching, I would have literally grabbed the ribeye by the bone and gone to town cave-man style--it was THAT good!\n\n*Creamed Spinach ($9): DELISH! The spinach was extremely fresh and maintained a vibrant green in the velvety and savory sauce. It was well-seasoned w/o being too salty and complemented the steak perfectly. \n\n*Creamed Corn Gratinee ($9): OMG good--it tasted like a mac & cheese made with corn. The creamed corn was sweet and tender and was topped with a panko breadcrumb crust which gave a nice crunch to the dish. It was an explosion of flavor and texture combos in your mouth...sweet, savory, buttery, and crunchy.\n\nSERVICE:\nImpeccable service, although a little pretentious at times. I guess you would expect nothing less from an upscale restaurant like Delmonico's. When it came down to serving our entrees, it was like a symphony as the waiters/waitresses served our dishes in-synch with one another to create a "ta-daa" moment.\n\nI would have given Delmonico's a 4.5 star rating, however, they allowed Freed's to deliver a b-day cake and didn't charge a slicing fee.\n\nAMBIANCE/DÉCOR: \nNormally steakhouses have a very "dark" ambiance. However, Delmonico's was the complete opposite. It was well-lit with Ivory walls and ceilings with accent cobblestone walls, crisp white linens and chestnut furniture created a very simple, yet elegant feel.\n\nI'm ALL about splurging when on vacation. Go big OR go home right? And, when you're in Vegas, you definitely have to go BIG--so, what are you waiting for? Go on and get your Bone-In Ribeye ON!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Pros\n\nEasy to make reservations\nTop notch professional service\nBone in Rib eye.............Best steak outside Argentina!!\n1st class wine list\nRomantic ambience\n\nCons\n\nBBQ Salmon was poor.\nPricy.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went there with co-workers because one of them had a craving for steak. We should've gone to just a whatever steakhouse that you could have for less than $20.\n\nTheir bone-in steak ran about $48. Their appetizer salad special of the day (which I had as an entree) was $20. Don't believe what the vegas tourist book says. It said it's "$$", where in actuality was more like "$$$$". I don't think I'd go there again. My friend said his lobster bisque soup was just "okay" and not as good as another, less expensive place. He said it was bland and not much flavor to it. Their twice-baked potato was pretty good, but I can imagine how unhealthy it is for you. \n\nTheir setting is nice though - dimly lit in some parts of the restaurant. Great for couples or dates. And if you want to go there, make sure it's something special like a birthday or anniversary. That's probably the only time I'd go back IF I ever went back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Celebrating a friend's birthday last night November 1st everything started out well with our server Drew it went downhill from there when we were asked to move our table in the middle of a eating our appetizers for a party of four boisterous drunk men. when I say move I mean they literally asked our party of 4 to get up moved our table near the wall and pushed two smaller tables together for the party of 4 men. The Apex and Sema Convention were on town so the restaurant was packed. I had a ribeye steak which was good however the baked potato I ordered was cold along with our other sides. I will give credit to the manager who did remove the sides from our bill.  The bone marrow toast did not taste like it had any bone marrow at all and the BBQ shrimp was just ok.    I was very disappointed especially after spending  $388\n  I wasn't aware the convention was in town or we definitely would have come another night. when your spending that much money on a steak I think the service and meal should be outstanding
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I cannot say enough about this place. The steak was no doubt the absolute best I've ever had, the shrimp was excellent as well. Had a fabulous wine. ordered a variety of desserts  my favorite was the banana cream pie. Can't wait to go back!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	while in vegas attending my employer conference -  myself, my business partner and our clients ate here for dinner. \n\n- ambiance is "right on"\n- service is "awesome"\n- food is "Oh My Gosh" (alaskan halibut w/ mash potato)\n\nneed i say more?
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Excellent dining experience!  The food was just wonderful as well as the service.\nWe ordered:\nShrimp cocktail \nTuna and salmon tartare\nFrench onion soup\nWilted spinach salad\nShared bone in rib eye\nTwice baked potato\nMushrooms\nPecan pie\nThe standouts were the spinach salad the poached egg made is awesome and the tartare superb.  For the sides highly recommend the twice baked potato, so cheesy, yum! The crust on the pecan pie was so flaky and light and delicious, I would order it every time! \nThe restaurant is beautiful and I would definitely return again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Very big portions and the service is amazing! The mashed potatoes and mushrooms were so good! It's expensive so make sure you only take the person that you really really REALLY (did I mention really) love lol!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Best...steakhouse...ever.  This was going to be the place our family went to where we weren't going to even look at the prices.  The bone-in rib eye was fantastic, all the sides were delicious, and the service was outstanding.  If you are looking for a great steak and a wonderful, special dining experience, visit Delmonicos
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Fantastic bone-in ribeye. Perfectly marbled. Delicious cajun rub. Great wine selection. The gumbo was great, but a little too refined...almost like a stew. Ambiance was a bit sterile. But, you're here for the steak... And it's awesome.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My boyfriend and I dined here last week. We were able to make 6:00 reservations two days in advance for a Thursday. The seating was very prompt, they pull out your chair and place your napkin on your lap.. very fancy. \n\nThe bread is like a hollow croissant roll which is delicious! They bring one at a time but it's unlimited. The butter comes on a design on a small plate.\n\nOur drinks were tasty, came quickly.\n\nFor an appetizer we got the king crab deviled eggs. They were good... nothing too special honestly.\n\nEntrees were the rib eye and filet and shareable sides were the mushrooms and gratin potatoes. Steaks were cooked to perfection, mushrooms were amazing. Potatoes tasted like plain scalloped potatoes, could've used more seasoning and cheese.\n\nDessert was pecan pie with caramel and vanilla ice cream.. amazing. \n\nThe service was great, our waters were never once empty, plates always cleared and food came out quickly.\n\nOver all it was a great date and experience. I would highly recommend if you haven't been. Being out of state we probably wouldn't go back because there are hundreds of other places for us to try first and we don't go to Vegas that often.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I was in Las Vegas for work, so was dining alone. I had no reservation but was able to eat at the bar. I had the rib-eye steak medium rare with a side of asparagus. The rib-eye  was amazing. It had a beautiful char and was delicious. Service was excellent and attentive. \n\nDefinitely one of the best dining options in Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	As I have been to the Emeril Delmonico restaurant in New Orleans and enjoyed it immensely, I decided to have dinner at the Delmonico Steakhouse located in the Venetian Resort Hotel & Casino where I was attending the Phantom of the Opera later that evening (incredible show by the way!).  What you'll find is a variety of food selections with Creole influences. \n\nFirst the menu prices are expensive ($$$$) but you are there for the intimate and fine dining experience and should be expecting to pay those prices.  What I didn't expect was to be dressed up and have an individual in shorts, sandals, and a Baltimore Colts jersey seated at an adjacent table to me.  Kind of lowered my view of this establishment being world class if you know what I mean.\n\nI started with the Lobster Bisque which was just superb but did lack the "Creole" twist I was expecting (The BAM factor).  Only thing that was a little of an inconvenience was the lobster pieces were quite large and were hard to cut with my spoon.  The wife selected the Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad Creole Spiced Croutons, Sherry Vinaigrette, Shaved Manchego Cheese Roasted Teardrop Tomatoes and Shaved Red Onion.  I had a taste and it was very good.  The different flavors were unique and distinctive.\n\nThe main course I selected a Pinot Noir wine that to go along with my Ribeye Steak and selected the Roasted Fingerling Potatoes and Whole Garlic with Fresh Herbs.  The wine was fantastic with a rich and bold body and floral aroma.  Wasn't dry and complimented the Ribeye Steak very well.  The Ribeye has Emeril's classic touch written all over it with the blackened spice rub with a pat of herb butter on top.  The cut was 1-1/2 inches thick, lean, and very large portion.  The potato dish was okay, didn't impress me in any way.  The wife also had the Pinot Noir and selected the Filet Mignon.  The cut had to be nearly 2 inches thick, lean, and a normal portion size.  I recommend selecting your Ribeye to be cooked medium rare (I do not recommend medium) and your Filet Mignon medium rare or at the most medium.  \n\nSorry to say we were extremely full when we finished and couldn't partake of dessert.  The meal described above with tip was roughly $210.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We were invited to dinner here as part of a work office getaway in LV. Prior to arrival, I had whisked thru the menu as well as some reviews. I was actually expecting to be disappointed. I assumed that the prices might sway the opinions of many.\n\nMan, was I wrong. We walked in to this modern but simply decorated establishment on time and our party of 11 were immediately seated. Michael was our head server and he made sure we received water, a wine list and our menus.\n\nI had noticed that a summer trio for $65 was available so that is the angle I decided to take. I felt a little guilty that our employer was eating this tab so I wanted to be fair. I ordered the Mini Wedge, the Petite Rib-Eye and a Caramel Butter Cake a la mode. Most went this route although some selected the STRIP. You think Vegas had something to do with that?\n\nMy salad was good but I thought the Bleu Cheese on the plate was a bit understated. I do like Bleu Cheese with some POP. My Rib-Eye was called petite but it was still a plentiful portion. It was prepared PERFECTLY and the Chimichurri applied on top had the old taste buds doing somersaults.  \n\nThe dessert which is offered by itself was upgraded with a scoop of ice cream with Michael's recommendation. His idea was spot on. All in all, everyone enjoyed their FABULOUS meals. We laughed, conversed and immersed ourselves in each other. We definitely had a relaxing dinner. \n\nThe evening would not have been as grand without the service we received. Michael and his staff performed impeccably. The service was orchestrated and attentive. Make sure to stroll in one evening and ask if Michael can take care of you. You will not regret it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Nice place. Good steaks, delicious sides, good service. A bit overpriced, but not bad for Vegas. The only problem was with my salad. The egg was overcooked, and when I asked for another, they didn't bring a new salad, just a new egg, which turned out to be overcooked as well. I gave up and started eating the salad anyway, and when I pulled out a long dark curly hair, I stopped. They took the salad away, and three people apologized, but they didn't offer me another appetizer. They did make up for the unconvinced by comping our corkage, dessert, and, of course, the salad. It was a nice way to make up, but we didn't find out about that until the end of the meal.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went for a nice anniversary dinner. Researched a lot of steakhouses and thought this was reasonably priced (compared to others) for Vegas so thought we'd give it a shot. made reservations but was not crowded on a Monday night. We split the bbq shrimp which were very good for an appetizer. Then we each had salads. I ordered the filet mignon which was a small 6oz serving for $50. I could've easily eaten 2 of them. But the steak was very tender and nicely seasoned. Husband had the bone in ribeye which is what they are known for. He enjoyed it. We split the mashed potatoes which were very good, but kinda hard to screw those up. We each had 1 drink and the bill was $200. Service was good. They give you nice warm rolls which were tasty. We would go back, but we like trying new places and it will probably be a few years before we go back to Vegas anyways.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This was my second time here and is becoming my go to romantic spot in Vegas. The ambiance alone sets the tone for the nights experience. That staff is super welcoming in and delightful. And the steaks was cooked to perfection. Hands down one of the beat bone in ribeye steaks that I've ever tasted.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This review is only for the front lounge area as we were in for drinks and appetizers.  \n\nDrinks were fine, service was totally average...not great but not bad either.  We ordered an assortment of appetizers to share.  Butternut squash ravioli, truffle chips (weird to order potato chips at a nice restaurant, but we did not based on waitress recommendation) and shrimp were wonderful, the pork not so much....it was very mushy and gamy tasting for some reason. I don't consider myself a food snob, but I took one bite and did not eat any more.  \n\nWe booked this place based on yelp reviews and now I can see why they are mixed.  I would for sure give this place another shot if we were in Las Vegas AND in the Venetian/Palazzo area.  That said, I would not go out of my way to dine here again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Perhaps one of the best meals I have had! Service was excellent and very attentive. The petite rib-eye with bacon wrapped shrimp, garlic mashed potatoes with a sweet tomato reduction was more than excellent! The appetizer of ahi tuna and salmon tar tar was very tasty as well. My husband had told them that we were celebrating my birthday prior to our arrival. They didn't make a big fuss, but greeted us with a yummy mini-mushroom tart to start our meal and ended it with a creamy cheese cake and wished me a happy birthday in a very descrete way :-)  -- I'm not one for loud signing and being the center of attention.  Delmonico's is a very nice, classy place. We will be back for sure!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Good food.  Horrible service.  Had dinner in early March with a friend and the service was horrendous.  No one took are drink order for over 15 minutes even though the restaurant was only half full on a Thursday night - many people who were seated after us were already having their second drink and getting their appetizers.  Eventually after trying to get the waiters attention as he repeatedly walked by I ended up just having to get up and walk across the restaurant to have some one take our order which led to a waiter taking our drink and food order in a couple minutes....  But even then the service was lackluster and not a bit apologetic about the wait.  If you are spending $300 for dinner for two you expect decent service.  This place was a big fail.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Always a 5 star time at Delmonico's the ambiance, service & food always makes we leave with a smile. There have been times, where I try other steak houses when in Vegas, but I always leave saying. "Not as good as Delmonico's"... My order is usually the same each time; start with the Truffle Chips, then Lobster Bisque (mmmmmmmm),  sides Cream of Spinach and Cream of Corn... then the BONE IN RIB EYE - MEDIUM....    \n\nI'm smiling just thinking about it....
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	One of my favorite dishes is Rack of Lamb.  When I'm traveling for work and see it on the menu, I have to try it.  My bar of measure is Mr. B's in New Orleans French Quarter part of the Brennan family.  Short of flying to Paris to find a fair place to compete against Mr. B's grilled lamb chops, Delmonico's certainly gave Mr. B's a run for its money.\n\nI tried Delmonico's without looking at yelp first - in some countries I would be shot for this crime - and not knowing that Delmonico's even existed.  It was after a long day of work and simply being hungry, I walked into the first restaurant that was open without even looking at the menu.  When I was seated and handed the wine list, I knew I had found the right place, almost by divine inspiration.\n\nThe wine list was more like a wine book, only dedicating the last page to single glass selections.  The rest were bottles only.  This is where I figured out I was in a place worthy of my pallet.  They had 15 different vintages of Caymus Special Reserve.  Most fine dining places maybe have one or two at most.  Of course since the company was paying and no one to split a bottle, I could not in good conscious order a bottle.  I would have been hung by the accounting department.\n\nThe waiter gave the specials of the day and I of coursed b-lined for the lamb chops like a rabid dog.  When the dish arrived you could smell the fine attention to detail that the chef had prepared.  The Colorado rack of lamb with Roasted Cipollini Onions, Haricot Vert and Brandy Peppercorn Reduction staring back at me was love at first sight. \n\nI order my rack of lamb medium rare. Anything else would be blasphemous to the animal who sacrificed itself for my dining pleasure.  The lamb was tender and juicy all the way through.  The vegetables, especially the Cipollini onions soaked in the tender juices of the lamb melted in my mouth.  This was a meal that reminded me why it's so good to be alive.\n\nMy only regret and no fault to Delomico's is I broke and tried the bread pudding for desert.  Being an Emeril restaurant I figured why not.  Being a bread pudding connoisseur and having such a spectacular experience with the lamb, I had high expectations.  I will be fair and say I was offered the key lime pie instead but I stayed true to course and ordered the bread pudding.\n\nWas it bad? No but it was certainly average for the area and if placed in New Orleans, it wouldn't even register on the map.  Delmonico's is marketed as "creole" restaurant and as such looses a star for the poor attempt on their bread pudding.  \n\nWill I be back? Absolutely without a doubt! Will I be ordering the bread pudding? No and if have a hankering for bread pudding after your meal at Delmonico's, mosey yourself on down to Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill.  Order the spotted dog and you will be in bread pudding heaven.  With that said, Delmoico's is in my top three restaurants of all time in Las Vegas.  If you don't mind spending a pretty penny on dinner and you're a true fan of food, Delmonico's is hands down one of the finest restaurants in Las Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is my 2nd Emeril restaurant experience, first is NOLA and I loved it.  It's only getting 4 stars because my lobster was a little too salty.  BUT, the preparation of it has been the best that I have ever had. It was so tender and succulent.  I would definitely order it again, but would remind them to please not salt it so much.  Everything that I ate that night was to perfection.  The salad, the appetizer, filet mignon and lobster.  Our server was also very nice and very on top of servicing our every needs.  The wine that he recommended paired extremely well with our meal.  \n\nYes, the walls are cream colored.  But it's a very clean, fresh feel.  The table are nice and roomy.  The chairs are so big and comfortable, you can sit there for hours enjoying your meal and drinks.  The accent colors in there are a tuscan red, so imagine a nice warm, bright feel.  I really enjoyed it.  Plus it's Vegas, who doesn't hit the lounge or clubs afterwards for the dark, moody ambiance.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	After my first bite into a DelMonico's medium-rare filet, the taste indelibly etched itself into my memory. So much so, in fact, that I dreamt about the steak the following day. \n\nIs the drool obvious?\n\nI could eat this steak every day. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I would bow down to the cow that produced this steak.\n\nAs you can see, I'm offering a ringing endorsement for this Emeril-owned establishment. It is, hands down, the best steak I've ever had. They cook the meat to perfection, slightly bloody, just the way I like it, and crusted with a seasoning that offers just enough taste to add flavor to the steak, but not to take away from the meaty perfection.\n\nBesides the steak, the cheese fondue with mini-pretzels is unbelievably creamy and delicious. I could drink it.\n\nDelMonico's isn't cheap, but hell, this is Vegas. You're supposed to indulge, and this is a great place to do it. \n\nI'm really surprised at some of the negative reviews from other Yelpers, but all I can say is, I've been here three times, and the steak is still oh-so-close to my heart (and even closer to my stomach). \n\nReservations must be made significantly in advance. And don't be surprised when the bill comes-like i said, it's not cheap. But the service is amazing and totally attentive, and the food speaks for itself. It's in the posh Venetian (by far one of my favorite hotels in Sin City), so you want to dress to impress and sip top shelf martinis. Yum. I wish I were there right now. Where's my steak knife, dammit?
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I mainly went for the ceasar salad prepared tableside.  I ate in the bar, the bartender was very nice and helpful.  I got the grilled cheese with tomato soup.  Grilled cheese was very good but the soup was nothing special.  Now the salad that i read one reviewer said the best in vegas, which is the only reason i came.  Knowing that they put anchovies in it when they prepare tableside, i was going to tell them to hold off on that once they get started.  So as im waiting for them to come up and make it, they bring it already prepared.  What is that?  The whole point of getting it is to watch it being done and see that its made fresh.  So obviously the anchovies were already in it, and since i explained i didnt want them, they made another.   I was told its a fire hazard to prepare it in the bar area so they made it on the side when i wasnt looking.  The few bites i took werent that good.  So i watch them make the 2nd salad in the hallway.  Needless to say, it was totally flavorless, ive had better dressing from newmans own, and the lettuce was in long stems, not even cut up. I was very disappointed with the salad, although the other food looked good
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went to Vegas with the husband to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and take that honeymoon that had been postponed for far too long.  One of the reasons we booked at the Venetian was to dine at Delmonico Steakhouse.\n\nWe originally made a reservation for lunch on Sunday but moved it to dinner as the husband was worried lunch service didn't offer all the varieties of steak.  Made the mistake of booking for 9 pm on Monday, August 20th.  The hotel was packed with a new rush of guests as was the restaurant.\n\nEnjoyed a drink in the bar before being seated and were then led to a small table where we were introduced to Josh, our primary server.  Josh informed us that we would have 3 servers that evening one of which would be a sommelier.  \n\nWe perused the wine list and then Lamont came over and asked "if anyone had explained the menu" to us - a jarring question in a fine dining establishment.  We decided to start with wine by the glass as we didn't want a full bottle at that point.  I asked Lamont about a blend on the list -- I inquired as to what was in the blend.  He asked me what I meant.  I clarified by saying what types of wines are used to make the blend.  He rattled off one variety and then said "and I think a Cabernet is in there".  Lamont made no offer to explain or recommend any other wines.  We ordered two glasses of Malbec, our appetizer and entrees.  My husband asked Lamont if he could get a side of garlic butter.  Lamont said no - they don't have garlic butter.  Really?!  This is an Emeril Lagasse restaurant!  He asked for a side of plain butter and we sent Lamont on his way.  \n\nA food runner, or possibly our third server (he never introduced himself), delivered a complimentary appetizer of tuna atop a crostini which I enjoyed but the husband did not.\n\nJosh came back with our wines.  We inquired as to whether Lamont was the sommelier that Josh had mentioned earlier and he affirmed that he was.  We expressed our surprise and disbelief yet Josh did not follow up with any inquiry as to why we asked the question.  At this point I had to talk my husband out of storming out of the restaurant.  Josh did not alert the floor manager of our question or our discontent.  It is unclear if this was because of poor training or due to the staff not being able to handle when the restaurant is full.\n\nOur salad with arugula, granny smith apples, prosciutto and champagne vinaigrette arrived and was very tasty.  We started to move past the negativity and then waited and waited for our entrees.  The husband ordered another glass of Malbec and asked for more bread, which never came.  The steaks were quite good but the extra butter was not delivered.  The twice baked potato was yummy and the side of mushrooms was divine.  \n\nThe espresso creme brulee and pecan pie desserts were very good and we appreciated the complimentary banana gelato with 'Happy Anniversary" written in chocolate on the plate but it still wasn't enough to make up for the fact that our servers' poor performance ruined an experience we looked forward to for months.  I would have given Delmonico Steakhouse one star due to the service but gave it two because of the food.  We expected much more.  I suggest you go somewhere else.\n\nFYI - Delmonico Steakhouse is a large restaurant that seats approximately 100 patrons.  The women's restroom has 2 stalls.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Every Vegas trip needs a fancy dinner. Delmonico just happened to be the restaurant this time around. I've never eaten steak in Vegas before (unless you count the $5 steak and egg places which I don't) so now was the time.\n\nAlas, I ordered the bbq salmon and I'm glad I did because it was delicious. Perfectly cooked and the potatoes on the side were delectable.\n\nI tasted my friend's steak which I had no complaints with. It just wasn't anything special. I'm pretty sure I could have made the same steak for cheaper. \n\nHowever, since California is banning foie gras, we ordered that with the steak and boy was that fattened duck liver good on top of it.\n\nFour stars because service was excellent and very friendly and my salmon was fantastic.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Impeccable service, amazing food, & super easy accessibility when staying at The Palazzo means 5 stars all the way in my book.\n\nBut the FOOOOOOD alone deserves 5 stars:\n\nTuna & Salmon Tartare - very fresh tuna & salmon tartare, each delicately seasoned, with a bit of wasabi sauce & seaweed salad in between.  A lightly dressed cucumber and red onion salad with the tiniest seasame seeds sprinkled on top added a nice vinegary element.  And crunchy wonton chips were perfect to scoop up everything with.  Great texture & flavor!\n\nBone In Ribeye - a seared perfectly, served medium rare, herb butter topped, giant steak.  Classic.  Awesome.\n\nApplewood Smoked Double Cut Kurobuta Ham Chop - I'm not a big fan of pork so if I say that I loved this, it's a BIG deal.  This double cut chop had seared, caramelized, fatty edges, and was perfectly seasoned.  This was THE juiciest pork chop I've ever had.  Served with pecan-topped, candied sweet potatoes that are a MUST eat with the chop, & a cider reduction.  The combination of savory, sweet, buttery, meaty, pecan-y, brown sugary, and slightly hammy flavors together were amazing.  Emeril knows his pork!\n\nWild Mushrooms - a generous mess of delicious mixed mushrooms.  Yes.\n\nBanana Cream Pie - a ridiculously impressive-looking presentation, crazy tall!  Thin & slightly salty crispy graham crust, tons of freshly sliced bananas, able to reach such heights because the pudding was more cheesecake-y texture & acted as banana mortar.  Topped with fresh whipped cream, a drizzle of caramel, & a few chocolate shavings.  You'd have to be crazy to attempt to eat this alone!\n\nThis was definitely a dinner to remember, and that ham chop is something to spread the word about.  Get it!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My experience is from dining at the bar. I never discount the bar as an option for a wonderful evening. It honestly is the best way for a single diner or even two people to enjoy a nice evening without the pretense of an uppity experience.\n\nMy friend and I came to Delmonico, dressed in tank tops and jeans, so we found an open spot up front. The bartenders are friendly and just as polished as any server. The recommendations for red pairing with our bone in ribeye to the port at the end was perfection. We started our meal off with the steak tartare. It has to be the second best in the city. I wished they would use a quail egg to dress it instead of a chicken's. Moving on to our entree, we split the ribeye and it was more than enough for the both of us. Add a side of the haricot vert with sauteed shallots and it is the perfect meal. Being in an Emeril restaurant we we had to finish with one of his specialty desserts. I tend to not be a big pie fan, so we went with the bread pudding. It is decadent and comes in a generous portion. No one person should be able to polish one off on their own. \n\nThis is one of those restaurants were I would not even bother with getting a table and would prefer to eat out at the bar.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The food here is pretty good but the reason I'm giving 3 stars is because I personally don't think it's any better than a Ruth's Chris, which is half the cost.\n\nWhat stood out the most was the lobster bisque. It was really good! But everything else wasn't better what I could have gotten at Ruth's Chris, especially not the banana cream pie which was worse.\n\nMy advice, save your money and go to Ruth's Chris or another restaurant.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had dinner here about a year ago. Great service, good ambience. I ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb, it was delicious. Also a bonus; sizable, clean restrooms.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We had a great meal last night because service was first class. I wouldn't order the bone in ribeye I didn't think it had a good flavor. Steak tartare was delicious and the cream of corn.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Oh man. This place never gets old. I hit up Vegas about a dozen times a year and this is a must dine place. The succulent bone-in ribeye is amazing. The sides are a la carte and big enough to share. I suggest having the chef's specials at least once. They are always changing and are so delicious. It is a bit pricy but that's Vegas. You pay for QUALITY! So make a reservation. You can use Open Table on line or through the app. If you go for a special occasion, let them know. They will always go out of their way to do something special.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	At least 4.5 stars. Let me start by staying that I thought this was a great place. The ambiance was fantastic and maybe I enjoyed myself so much because we went here with a group of 18 or so right after my husband and I got married in the Venetian but here's the breakdown. \n\nThe appitizers were really great, the parmesan chips were thin and had wonderful flavor. We talked about stealing a basket as we left. The bbq shrimp was done perfectly and a great twist. \n\nMy brother had the soft shell crab and that may have been my favorite thing I had. It was fantastic but I don't have much comparison since that was actually the first time I've had soft shell crab. Nevertheless, it had great flavor and I would order it again. My husband and I split a steak and got the cesear salad. The salad was really nice and fresh. The steak was great, and probably in the top 3 I have ever had. \n\nWe had a bunch of wine and tried a few different kinds and they were all great. The manager came over and talked to us about the wines and was very informative and nice. \n\nThe reason why this didn't get 5 stars from me was because for the price, you just expect a little more from the steaks. This was still one of the best dinners I have ever had and I would absolutely go back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Thought it was incredible. My steak was phenomenal. My girlfriend got the lobster special. Hand made pasta, lobster, in a black truffle butter sauce. The food was top notch, great ambiance, great experience.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The service here is VERY mixed.  The first time I came (months ago), the host/hostess was NOWHERE to be found for like 10 minutes when I arrived for my party's reservation.  Then once someone was at the front desk, she totally ignored my existence and we stood there for another ten minutes.  Then some guy finally comes and I'm like I had reservations for so and so time and he is like I'm sorry, we just had a large party come in so there may be a bit of a wait.  \n\nOK?  That was a first.  I was expecting a little more attentiveness from a restaurant like this.  And it was kind off-putting to have had reservations at a restaurant of this calibre not honored.  We were told to wait in the bar area, where we were not even offered so much as a glass of water, and then ignored for another 15 minutes by the hostess until we decided to leave.\n\nTHE NEXT DAY, someone calls me and is like you missed your reservation last night.  Um NO, we were there and waited for about 45 minutes and left.  Then he was apologetic and offered to comp our dinner if we were to come back, but I was flying out that day and had to decline that offer.  Then he proceeded to ask for my address so that they could send a gift card.  I was like ok sure.\n\nI was surprised that the gift card was for as much as it was.  It was very generous of them.\n\nOn to the visit where I actually got to eat!\n\nThe mister and I came during lunch time on a Sunday.  Again, the hostess was nowhere to be found for the first 5 minutes or so.  Then she comes out and is like there is going to be a wait (I had reservations, yet again.)  So we sat at the bar, where the very attentive (and I guess new) bartender proceeded to hand us menus.  Then we were like ehh we'll just eat at the bar.  A couple minutes later, the hostess was finally like oh ok are you guys eating here?\n\nWe started with the Potato Chips with Truffle Oil and Parmesan MMMMM!!  For my entree, I had the Gulf Shrimp with fettucine and preserved lemon.  The shrimp was very juicy and fresh-tasting.  The bartender, who ended up being pretty much our server was very nice, attentive, and actually really fun to talk to.\n\nSo despite the initial situation, four stars for the delicious food, service at the bar, and the lengths the management went to make up for the mistake.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	i had an amazing dinner here the other night with a friend.  In often too-busy Vegas, it's nice to find a nice, quiet, comfortable, spacious restaurant like this one, tucked in the Restaurant Row of the Venetian.\n\nThe food was very good -- I'd recommend the heirloom tomato salad and the lobster bisque.  The Filet was great as was the bone-in ribeye.  The wine list is amazing with a very nice collection of French wine, top burgundies in particular.  And if you're in the mood to drop $500-$750 on a bottle, you can actually great a very good value on wine that would cost much more elsewhere.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We have eaten here every time we are in vegas.Consistently top notch food drinks and desserts.Felt like a king and queen for 2 hours. Cannot say one bad thing about this place . Emeril has it down to a fine art! You will not be disappointed!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Best. Steak. Ever. \nYou pay for it, but that's expected at a high class restaurant. \nService is exceptional... Food is off the chart!!\nWould definitely return when I'm back in town.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We stayed at the Palazzo and wanted to have a nice dinner at one of the restaurants in the hotel. I checked Yelp and found Delmonico had a really good review and made reservations for 9:30pm on Friday. The place was pretty full, with more and more guests still coming in.\n\nConsidering the price of the meal and the Yelp description we put on our "dressy" clothes. After we were seated a group of 6 came in wearing t-shirts, baseball caps, shorts, and flip flops. Oh well, that's Vegas for you.\n\nInstead of the usual bread basket, the wait staff would place a warm roll on your plate when needed. It was one of the best rolls I've had in a while. A warm soft roll with a sprinkle of salt on top. We ordered for an appetizer, the Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare Cucumber Salad and Wasabi Aioli. I thought it was a bit salty, but the bf thought otherwise. We still scarfed it down. Because it was a busy night, we did have to wait a bit between the appetizer and our entrees. But the wait staff was very attentive most other times. \n\nThe bf ordered the Filet Mignon. He said it was very tasty and melted in his mouth. I ordered the Roasted Rack of Colorado Lamb, Fresh Herb Popover and Black Truffle Reduction. By far the best lamb I have ever had. Previous times when I ordered lamb, it had a gamey taste. For a second, I thought I was eating filet mignon. The Black Truffle reduction has a nice addition. It did not cover up the taste of the lamb. The popover was light and airy and tasted of rosemary.  We shared the New Orleans Style Creamed Spinach as a side. It was rich, creamy and delicious. I didn't get to finish my cocktail by the end, so the waiter placed it in a "to-go" cup. The "to-go" cup being a hotel glass. \n\nIf I had the money to splurge again, I'd definitely go back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	we are a repeat customer-- best service - Thx Tom!!! Best NY steak, Ribeye---unbelievable flavor. Great Kir Royale.  Unbelievable Banana Cream Pie.  This has to be best restaurant in vegas
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	On our first night's stay at The Venetian, we walked to Delmonico in less than 5 minutes and were seated on time.  It took approximately 60 seconds for the staff to begin delivering The Bliss.  I am not a steakhouse fan (my husband is), but this restaurant is an Emeril restaurant, and having had wonderful experiences at his other establishments in New Orleans, I thought we would be in for a treat.  The service was extraordinary even though the restaurant was hustling at by 8 p.m., we had the full attention of our waiter as well as the sommelier and other ancillary staff, which made the evening a lot of fun.  We enjoyed an amuse bouche of heirloom tomatoes, basil, burrata cheese and EVOO.  My husband ended up with an enormous piece of meat on his plate (no surprise there) that he stated emphatically was the best steak he'd ever had, accompanied by a terrine-sized dish of the New Orleans Creamed Spinach, easily the best creamed spinach I've ever put in my mouth.  I only wish I had been able to enjoy the leftovers in an omelette the next day for breakfast.\n\nI ordered one of the specials, which was a $42 plate of pasta.  Yes, you read right: a $42 plate of pasta.  It was heaven: just the right amount of papparadelle with six very large shrimp, and a generous amount of andouille sausage and artichoke hearts.  I enjoyed a complementary glass of red wine that was a blend of several varietals; complex and nicely balanced, it was a wine that Emeril endorsed and labeled, and it had been bottled by Au Bon Climat Winery in Santa Barbara, CA.  I started with the mixed greens salad, dressed with a sherry vinaigrette and shaved Manchego cheese.  It was perfectly balanced and just the right flavor profile for my mood that night.  We were too full for dessert, but had there been room, my money would have been on Emeril's Banana Cream Pie, served with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings and whipped cream. I didn't take pictures at Delmonico, but we enjoyed our food immensely and I would return in a heartbeat.  The staff is well-trained and extremely attentive, and the food is unpretentious, well-prepared and top-drawer.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I had such a delicious dinner at this restaurant!! First it was the only restaurant that I could find on OpenTable that would accommodate a party of eight.   That was very helpful since we were all in Vegas for a race the next day.\n\nOur lead server, Tom, was spectacular!  He was truly helpful in giving us recommendations and extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  \n\nI got the barbecue shrimp which was phenomenal. The shrimp was done to perfection and the sauce was delicious. The biscuit was a little bit hard but not as important as everything else.  They also served popovers on the table instead of bread. The popovers were chewy and gummy and I would've preferred some other type of bread on the table. Maybe they're not fantastic at making bread. \n\nI got the special of a bone in filet mignon cooked rare. The rare was done perfectly! I was very impressed.  I also got the grits and the creamed corn for side dishes. Their grits were a little bit grainy for my taste although the flavor was good. The creamed corn was fabulous!\n\nOur table pretty much ordered one of every dessert. I ordered the banana cream pie based on a friend's recommendation. I have to say that was not my favorite but that's because I don't care for bananas in my dessert. My bad since I knew that. The banana cream pie was extremely dense with bananas. However I traded with another friend who got the pecan pie in the oatmeal cookie crust. Oh my gosh that was heaven!!  \n\nThe dinner was superb and the service was excellent! I would return here again in the future and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Pretty good. It was an enjoyable meal although somewhat pricey. Food-wise I ordered the foie gras appetizer, bone-in ribeye, and pecan pie. Even if you like foie gras pass on this one. It was heavily coated in honey and I didn't enjoy it. The bone-in ribeye was delicious and cooked to perfection as was the pecan pie. \n\nDelmonico has a great wine list and we ordered a nice bottle that complimented all of our meals and then we ended with a nice 40 year tawny port and coffee. \n\nSomeone in my group had ordered a filet cooked medium and if was more medium-rare than medium. \n\nI would return here but it's not a place that I would make a regular for me when I go to Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2nd strike emeril! i was diappointed with emeril's fish house but decided to give his steak house a try. i ordered the steak and scallop dish. my scallops were overcooked!!! unacceptable! my steak and my friend's steak were good but i will probably try other steakhouses before coming back here.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The food was great. We had:\n\nFoie gras and grilled octopus for appetizers (both excellent)\nMixed green salad (very good)\nFrench onion soup (so-so)\nBoth my wife and I had bone-in ribeyes (excellent)\n\nBest steakhouse in Vegas.  We would definitely go again.  Only knock is the service was only okay.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Steak was very good, sides were ok, and our waiter was helpful but didn't look to be overly excited about working.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	What a treat!  I expect a lot from a top end steak house and was skeptical that Emeril's name and reputation might be trumped up, but several friends said we had to try his Delmonico steak house.  They were right. \n\nWe ordered the bone-in ribeye and the short ribs.  Both were easily the best examples of meat perfection we'd ever had - seasoned delicately and aged just right for an incredible buttery, nutty flavor that almost makes me think of buttered popcorn or butter toasted pecans. That delicate flavor was well paired with a bold garlic and cheese potato dish that we shared and a very nice bottle of Cain Concept from Napa Valley. \n\nThe staff were very helpful and accommodating - we asked for their names to request them again - we had a "team" including Tom Baker and Braden Guy, both gave expert advice and were supremely attentive without smothering us. \n\nTo top off the meal we had the pecan pie/tart topped with caramel and ice cream.  YUM. \n\nWILL RETURN ON NEXT LV VISIT FOR SURE!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had the lobster bisque and NY Strip.  Bisque was decent but nothing special and the steak was just above average.  Under cooked slightly as well which is surprising from a steakhouse.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I kinda view the steakhouse experience from several angles. Not just the price, but also the entrees and sides, the pairing with wine, the atmosphere waiting in line.\n\nI personally liked the atmosphere, as it was nice to have dim lighting for a late 9pm dinner. The waiting bar was nice, although the seats are very very low. A nice confidence booster for short folks, but some might find it uncomfortable. \n\nInside the restaurant, seats are very comfortable. Unlike my counterparts Don and Elmer, I ordered the standard NY bone-in steak. Very good, my only complaint was that it wasn't boneless! The wine was great; the waiter was helpful in selecting a bottle, very tasty but not too pricey for 4 near-thirtysomethings. The side dish of warm spinach salad(which yours truly ordered) was the showstealer of the night. Everyone liked it, so keep it on your radar if you go.\n \nOverall, I thought it was great. I gave it 4 stars, though it would really be 3 and a half stars. If you want a better selection of steaks, probably go to Ruth Chris, NERO or the Bradley Ogden restaurants. In Vegas, the benchmark is BOA, but BOA can get very very pricey. But for the value and overall celebrity restaurant experience, a good experience. Definitely make reservations thru the casino or through opentable. I would go again with a small group or for an intimate dinner with my girlfriend.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Amazing meal, great atmosphere. My coworkers and I were in Vegas for a work trip and were looking for a great dining experience. To start, the tuna and salmon tartare was amazing, along with a delicious cheese plate! We were pleasantly surprised most of the cheeses were from marin county, ca where we live and work! Two of us got salads, they were fresh and crisp and not over dressed. The steaks for our entrées were AMAZING.  I got the special which was a surf and turf filet mignons and shrimps, my coworker got the 100% Japanese wagyu and it MELTED the second it hit my tongue. The most delicious rib eye we have ever had! And for dessert we split a slice of key lime pie. Yum!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I wouldn't call myself fancy. I wouldn't call myself classy. I wouldn't call myself upscale.\nSo when I go restaurants that are fancy, classy and upscale I immediately feel like everyone in there can tell I don't belong. I don't know what fork is for what. I don't know where to put my napkin when I get up from the table and I swear everyone else notices. I also don't venture to fancy, classy and upscale places cause I almost always hate the food.\nThe fancier the words on the menu the less I wanna try it. \n\nThis is NOT that kind of place. Yes, it is fancy, classy and upscale. Yes the menu is a bunch of jibberish food. \nBut somehow I was still able to make out a few key words to order what was Caprese salad and Potato Soup.\nHOT DAYUM DUDE: Emeril is no joke.\nThe Caprese was so fresh. The tomato tasted like it was picked 15 minutes before it was cut and placed beautifully on my plate. The Potato soup had big chunks of bacon at the bottom and the server poured my soup over it. Then added a junk of Parmesan cheese and yuuum.\n\nIn other fancy, classy and upscale joints I feel uncomfortable to even speak to my serious server. Not this guy. Our server was casual yet still very serious about his job. He even cracked a smile a few times. \n\nI cannot rave enough about this place. It was beautiful and elegant, delicious and exciting flavors. I loved every second of Delmonico\n\nMy two small complaints\n1. The bathroom smells like wet rocks. Its has really cook huge rock walls but since its in a bathroom it smells weird. You know the smell of a dirty lake? That is the smell the bathroom had.\n2. This restaurant is inside the Venetian and VERY hard to find. There are no signs. None. Pointing you toward it. So from me to you: If you find the huge LOVE sign for the Beatles show it is directly to the right, almost hidden by the sign and the elevator.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I recently entertained clients here.  I made my reservation over Open Table.  Originally I had made for 4 people, then wanted to add one more guest.  They told me several times that there was no way they could fit another chair at the table.  Ok.\n\nWe get there, and there is a private party going on - but in the lobby/bar/wait area.  What?  That's a bit disturbing.  They sat us in the lounge area and we ordered drinks (which never came).  Then our "table" was ready.  Well this was the end table which basically was in the lounge area.  So we moved over one table. \n\nThe wine list is very in depth and almost overwhelming.  Just give me a good red with my meat is not the way to go here.  No simplicity.\n\nFrom the start our table was crowded.  Too many items on the tables, and the service ware was oversized for the little table.  It almost made it difficult to eat.\n\nBefore our food came I wondered off to the loo - which was like a hike because the restaurant is actually quite huge.  As I walked by tables, I saw several larger tables with less people seated at them and empty chairs.  Hmmm.  So they really couldn't let me bring an extra guest or they really don't know how to plan their seating?  \n\nDuring our meal we couldn't even talk - the noise from the private party was too much.  And they were standing all around us.  Several time people knocked into the back of my clients' chair!  So frustrating.  I can't understand WHY they would seat people in that area - and we had plenty of room for the extra guest.  \n\nThe food was wonderful.  Meat done right.  But all the negatives earn this only 2 stars.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Loved the bar b que shrimp it was amazing but i wish the portions matched the big flavor......
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	i come here every time i visit vegas. the bone-in ribeye is solid, i usually eat at the bar by myself, servers are friendly and attentive without being intrusive.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	It's been a long time since I been to Delmonico's. I used to be a big fan of Emeril. I'm sure I had some pork dish and something wrap i bacon. Just make sure you make reservation WAY in advance.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I really enjoyed the overall experience!  The bone in filet with foie gras was really amazing.  The drinks were wonderful and they have a very nice wine selection.  The service was 'jonnie on the spot' with all levels of servers keeping a watchful eye on the table...perhaps too watchful!  Twice, as I looked around to check out the décor and the people, they came running over to assist.  Better to have false alarms then left waiting.\n\nIf the place has one issue, it's the atmosphere.  The design is plain white arched ceilings with rock wall and white light accents.  I respect how much they were able to achieve with just architecture and lights, but without the lights it might look a bit like a medieval dungeon.  \n\nAll things considered, the food and service were about as good as it gets so go check it out!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is the third time I've been to Delmonico and enjoyed it. After having one of the best steaks of my life at Rosemary's the night before, I opted for some Peppered Ahi Steak. It was good, not great. It was lacking a little something. The wine was great. My husband had the grilled chicken which was very good. Overall, it was okay. Nothing spectacular that made me want to return.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Wonderful experience, food was fantastic and our Waiter, Lamont was top notch.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	came here with a group of 16 for the fiance's 30th birthday weekend -- 14 adults plus 2 little kiddos (ages 4 and 6).  the service was outstanding!!!  our group of 16 had to be split into 2 circular tables next to each other which made it really difficult to socialize w/each other.  however i really really appreciated how attentive the waiters were, and they treated my little nephews really well too.  i was pleasantly surprised when they offered the boys kids meals consisting of grilled cheese sandwiches and french fries :)\n\nnow...for the food review.  first off i must clarify, i do not eat beef so my review is for the lamb chop.  lamb is usually a gamble for me because i only like it if its cooked right and does not smell lamb-ey.  my lamb chop was ehhhh.  the meat portion was HUGE, but only the outside was tasty.  the entire inside of my meal was verrrrry gamey -- which i do not like.  we ordered the creamed spinach, potatoes, and mushrooms to share.  they tasted like --- creamed spinach, potatoes, and mushrooms.  really nothing special.  everyone else seemed to enjoy their steaks, but if there's a next time maybe i'll try the pork chop instead.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Impeccable service & the ambiance was right on. We had the cowboy ribeye and was top notch, the au gratin potatoes were recommended and was not let down and the mushrooms were OH SO GOOD! We were over stuffed but had to try the infamous banana cream pie.... AMAZING.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Good for the management to reach out and connect with me.  I hope they are sincere in making an effort to make this establishment a better experience for everyone.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Had been here four years ago and the experience was so much better that time. We brought a fine bordeaux for my birthday both times and were aware of the corkage policy. Wine spectator gives them the highest award and complements their corkage policy in fact. It took forever to get the bottle decanted and it really wasn't optimal and the meal was rushed. We even had cocktails  Snotty server, devil may care attitude. Sommelier? Or was he just the one who poured wine?  Not sure as he also offered food recommendations. Gumbo good, tomato soup and grill cheese ap okay but not fine. Avg cream spinach and dried baked potato. Partner had BBQ shrimp and was not overly impressed. Sadly the rib eye was only decent, but not out of this world. I was so looking forward to this night and it was a disappointment. Cavernous restaurant about 70 % filled on a Wednesday but the personal touch and care of a few years ago was gone.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico's is a very good steak house. We had an excellent meal and the bone-in ribeye was huge and pretty flavorful. The filet was tender and delicious. The sides were very good (really loved the mushrooms) and leave room for the banana cream pie. \n\nGreat service, staff willing to help you with their extensive wine list and the bar served great drinks. \n\nI did think it was pricey though - there are many other excellent steak houses in Vegas so it' really doesn't stand out. Not to damn them with faint praise of course.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Unfortunately the food was so bland considering the bill came out to 200$. Tried the bone in rib eye had a decent char but very bland no salt or seasoning, filet mignon was the only good dish but lacked any presentation just a chunk of meat on an oversized plate, bbq shrimp appetizer sauce was flavorless, fried oyster were breaded too much and the green pistachio sauce tasted and looked like baby food, the truffle potatoe chips eere drowned in oil, banana pie also tasted plain. Overall lack of love in the cooking and I could find more flavor at a home town buffet. Maybe an off night but the service was good at least until the server realized I had a comp :o went from 100 to 0 real quick lmao. Still tipped 50$
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place won't blow up the sky with "it's the best ever" fireworks but it is more than just a sparkler during the fourth of July.  \n\nThe must order dish...\n\nLobster Bisque....probably the best I have ever had.  Consider this the m80 of the meal exploding with flavor and a generous mound of Lobster.\n\nThe crab was good but nothing to oooh and aaaah over.  The steak was good too but I wasn't jumping up and down with excitement.  As for the side dishes...the gratin potatoes and the mushrooms were by far the best.  Our table tried almost all of them and those two would be the ones I would dive into.\n\nThe other guests felt everything was a little over seasoned.  I didn't get that but I am also borderline billy goat with my love of the salt.\n\nWhat gives this place 4 stars is the service.  The staff was awesome.\n\nLight the fuse of your tastebuds at this tasty steakhouse if you are craving an old school steak dinner with amazing service.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	EXCELLENT!! Everything was perfect...Ambiance, Service, especially the food.  Wished I had a bigger appetite to hold more food.   There were 3 of us girls sharing the Vine-Ripened Tomato Salad with the Burrata Cheese ~ Excellent!   We weren't very hungry so we shared the Chateaubriand among the 3 of us. It was a perfect size for 3 people.  The portions were well divided with enough sides and steak to go around for 3 people.  \n\nWe wished we had a bigger appetite to order dessert and try Truffle Potato Chips. Can't wait til my next Vegas trip to try out more of the menu.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	OH how I wish I could I was closer. This is by far the BEST steakhouse! Even my kids can tell a huge difference. When we told my kids we were going back for my birthday, they got all excited. Their signature ribeye is lightly season and grilled to perfection anyway you like it. The service is impeccable. I love how everyone gets served at the exact same time. There were 9 of us so we ordered the majority of the sides and everyone got to try everything. By the way one of reasons well ALL love coming here is the truffle oil and parmesan cheese potato chips. If Lays ever made these, I'd be all over them. Normally I never order dessert at a restaurant, but I always do here. They have the best! My favorite this time was the churros! OMG these were the absolute best churros I've ever had! I've been to a may steak houses and this place can not be beat!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great service! Excellent menu! Their chateaubriand steak was mouth-watering!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico's does not disappoint. Its a classic, upscale steakhouse with absolutely fantastic food. I go to Vegas every Memorial Day weekend and every year I pick a different Vegas steakhouse for one of my dinners. Last year was Cut and I was EXTREMELY disappointed. Delmonico however was fabulous. I had the lettuce wedge salad and the filet oscar and both were absolutely delicious. My husband had the spinach frisee salad and the filet au poivre and he also really enjoyed them. The food, atmosphere, everything was just fabulous! The only thing to be aware of is that its VERY expensive-- the filet oscar was $70! But its Vegas and its Emeril and its a fantasic restaurant so its well worth it for a night out.  I will definitely be back.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I feel like Twitter is pretty useless so far; I have an ok amount of followers I guess, but I feel like they're all following so many people that anything I say gets lost in the mess of their feed. I could tweet all day and get very little response to anything aside from a couple loyal folks on there. And it was one such reader that led me to Delmonico recently for what he claimed to be an excellent burger. He's a food writer in town so he should know what he's talking about, right?\n\nDelmonico is located in the small restaurant row of the Venetian right by another great burger spot, although most people would not come here for their burger. The interior is nothing too fancy in either the bar area or more traditional area in the back. I did notice while sitting at the bar that they have an amazing bourbon selection, but since I was there during a lunch break I'll have to go back some time when I'm not on the clock. The lunch and dinner menus are a bit different, with the lunch menu featuring more sandwiches and things, so maybe the comment I just made about people not coming for a burger is wrong. Either way, this restaurant is pretty fancy and features quite a number of great sounding items aside from what I came there for.\n\nThe Delmonico Prime Hamburger comes on a toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese and bacon. The meat had excellent flavor from the first bite, but I noticed right away that it was way overcooked and dry. It started off extremely juicy but that faded way too fast and by the end it was very dry. The cheese was melted and had great flavor, but the bun was a tiny bit dry as well and a little too thick. The heirloom tomatoes were fantastic, but maybe a bit off-putting at first due to their green color. The bacon also had good flavor, but was a tiny bit undercooked and soggy in parts. Overall it was still decent, but could have been well beyond that if the meat had been cooked properly.\n\nLuckily the fries were great. Some of them were almost a bit too hard and crunchy, but they were very tasty and a welcome change to the 'typical' fries I often get around town. Something I found to be quite funny was when I asked for ketchup I was brought an insanely large bowl of it, more than probably a table full of people could have used.\n\nThe online menu lists the burger at $15, so I was a little surprised to see the $18 listed on the menu when I made my order. I think if it was cooked properly I would still be ok with this price given the chef, the location, etc, but because of this price I seriously frown on the fact that they couldn't cook my burger properly. If you're willing to risk this inconsistency and are ok with the cost, I think it's a good burger to check out, and has the potential to be really great, but if you're at the Venetian and are craving a guaranteed good burger for a similar cost I suggest you go next door.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place is located in the Venetian.  Went for a prix fixe dinner that offered one starter, entree and a dessert.  We both got the bbq shrimp as the starter.  The shrimp didn't come out carmelized from being cooked on a bbq, it was served with bbq sauce.  They were good.   One of us got the little fillet and the other got the salmon entrees.  Both meals were great.  We were disappointed with the desserts.  The chocolate cake was hard.  The banana creme pie was also a little hard; appeared like it was layers of banana and cheesecake.  Not what I expected.  So, minus one star for the dessert.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	this was highly recommanded from a good friend of mine, he said that this is one of the best steakhouses to visit in vegas so we had to give it a try....but this is not a fair review because we dined at cut two night before...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The service is excellent.  The food quality is good but everything was very salty. We had the lobster, flounder, lobster bisque, tomato salad etc.  All those dishes were salty.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	too many places to eat in vegas! but, im not the type of girl who can ever turn down steak, so off to delmonico's it was\n\nwhat i ate:\n- heirloom tomato and burrata salad: caprese salad, all grown up! the heirloom tomatoes were delicious, juicy, and flavorful. the burrata cheese, gooey, creamy, the perfect delicate match to the tomatoes. the syrupy sharp balsamic vinegar reduction made everything go POP with flavor. my only gripe was that i wish there was more basil to bring in the fresh flavor. regardless, this was pretty damn good\n- [special of the day] beef medallions with mushrooms and parm: the beef had a nice bite to it, the mushrooms and sauce were to die for, but i wondered if i should have just opted for a nice steak\n- baked potato w/everything on it [side]: cheesy perfection\n- haricots verts [side]: perfectly cooked string beans with garlic and almonds\n- mushrooms [side]: a nice mix of mushrooms, this would make any mushroom lover happy\n- banana cream pie: i love banana cream pie, but lets be honest, all banana cream pies pretty much taste the same, right? wrong! this banana cream pie was perfectly layered. oh man, i could have eaten this entire thing all by myself, but sharing is caring!\n- coffee: coffee lovers beware! the coffee is so good (french pressed) that im tempted to just come back for a slice of the banana cream pie and coffee next time im in town!\n\npros:\n- food: food was perfect. everything was delicious\n- service: friendly, polite, helpful. our server helped me pick out a GREAT wine in the price point i wanted\n- free bruschetta starter. when i called to make the rez i let them know it was for a birthday\n- free banana sorbet for the birthday girl\n- bathrooms were clean and well stocked! my stall even had a lil basket of tampons. how thoughtful! ;)\n\ncons:\n- good food and good service comes with a price... but, to be honest, considering how much we ate, and having a bottle of wine, it was not any more expensive than i thought it would be. our entire meal, plus tax and tip came out about $500, which is very reasonable cause it was for five girls... it also helped that i won a few bills gambling earlier that day :P\n- reservations: i was able to get a rez for a late dinner, which is what i wanted anyways, but if youre planning on being in vegas, it would be smart to call to make a rez ahead of time if you like eating your dinner at the regular dinner time\n- loud: im not sure if its due to the dome shaped ceilings, but voices CARRIED. i guess you have to expect that though from a steak house - full of dates and GUYS\n\nwould i come again? if i won some extra cash gambling and craving steak, YES!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	There's a reason why Emeril Lagasse is such a celebrated chef. His restaurant, Delmonico Steakhouse, provided impeccable service and outstanding food.\n\nDelmonico Steakhouse was our big dinner out in Vegas for a bachelorette weekend. 9 of us were promptly seated for our 7:30pm Sunday reservation. I ordered a glass of malbec (my favorite, which is rather had to find).\n\nAs a table, we shared the BBQ shrimp (which was just the right hit of smokey and sweet), Truffle and Parm Potato Chips (uberly addictive) and the lettuce wedge salad.\n\nFor my entrée, I decided to get the Bone In Ribeye-the house specialty. It did not disappoint. It was quite a large piece of steak, but it didn't stop me from finishing all of it (that's not something I do very often). We split the creamed spinach and the creamed corn gratinee. The spinach was average but the creamed corn was vegetable candy. \n\nWe ended our meal with Emeril's infamous Banana Cream Pie. Holy moly. Sky high pie packed with bananas, caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. Even though we were all full, we couldn't help but finish it.\n\nOur waiter was extremely attentive. Service, overall, was phenomenal. When our steaks were ready, there was a server for each plate so we were presented our dishes at the same exact moment. Now that's service.\n\nIt goes without saying that this was pricey, even for Vegas standards, but you get what you pay for. \n\nI highly recommend checking out Delmonico at least once.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Lovely ambiance and decor. Excellent customer service. But for an Emeril restaurant, I expected waaaaay more flavour. Granted, I did order chicken (and I have yet to visit an upscale steakhouse who doesn't serve bland, dry chicken). \n\nWe came for thanksgiving dinner. There was a nice crowd... an older crowd. It's inside the Venetian. I ordered a loaded baked potato (or some potato dish) as a side. It looked beautiful and scrumptious but right after you get past the cheese and sour cream it's bland. I probably won't be back. But I can see why people like it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Worth the cost.\nThe food is amazing.  We ordered steaks and shared lots of pasta and other appetizers.  It is the meal I want to have before dying.\n\nWe ended up in a worse table location bc we were pretty late, but they still got us in.  Also, the spot we were at was cold bc of a draft and they quickly fixed the problem.\n\nFun for a dinner out with friends.\n\nStaff was exceptional.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My husband brought me here for my birthday. I have nothing but good to say about all the staff here. The food was fantastic! I ordered the bone in rib eye.. well done and it was perfect, They where courteous and got our order right! Loved it we will be coming back again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	OH MY GOSH! Whenever someone brings up food and Vegas, I always have to mention this place. It's so freaking awesome. The services is awesome, my friend dropped a spoon and before she could pick it up, she was handed a new one already. Then when dishes arrived, everyone got their plates at the exact same time. They had like 5 servers placing a dish in front of each person. We also got free crabcakes which was really nice of them. Now the food. Man yes it's expensive but SO WORTH IT! I mean you get a lot of food and the food is so freaking good. I have never tasted a ribeye steak greater than this one. It like melted in your mouth, even though meat isn't suppose to do that, I meant that it was so tender OH MY GOSH! I'm so going back next time I'm in Vegas. Their drinks are really good too. Man no complaints at all about this place!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is a great steakhouse in Las Vegas. \n\nWe started off with a caesar salad made table side. I had the rib eye and my husband had the filet mignon. Both were ordered medium and they both came out perfectly medium and mouthwateringly good! The sides were ok and the desserts were fantastic!\n\nThis is a great place to go for a birthday, anniversary or some special occasion. Although if you just have a hankering for a good steak on a Tuesday night, this place is good any time! Definitely make a reservation though because this place is packed!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	For me the bar has been raised! \n\nI thought the Conch Republic in Key West was my best meal ever. It has been topped. The best Ribeye I have ever eaten. Everything about this place was top shelf. I had the escargot, Ribeye, loaded baked potato, and finished it off with the best pecan pie ever.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	+ Food was GREAT! 5 stars. (ordered bone-in ribeye, tomato soup, fingerling potatoes, twice baked potato, & broccoli) All Delicious!\n\n- Service was 4 stars...At an upscale restaurant like this, I was expecting the server's to be friendly and attentive but they were just "okay".
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Worth every penny, just for the mashed potatoes alone.  That said, the steak is, of course, fantastic.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Ok, someone that doesn't eat meat has no business writing a review for a steakhouse but I went here a few months back with a group of friends and had a wonderful dining experience so I thought I would share.  My fish was eh, ok, but hey, it's a steakhouse.  What do you expect.  Everyone else raved about their steaks and the appetizers and sides were incredible.  Wine list was amazing and the best was this chocolate something or other desert.  OMG.  I had an orgasm right there at the table, I swear.  Great place, great service. great time.  4 stars.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I took my best friend to Delmonico Las Vegas last Saturday, January 14, 2017 for her Birthday dinner.  I was very disappointed, the Fried Oyster appetizer dish was cold at the inside, the Creole Shrimps was also cold where these 2 dishes was suppose to be hot.  The Bone-in-Rib eye was fatty and the Pork Chop tasted like Barbecue Pork.  The meal was expensive and I don't mind paying for an expensive meal but it was not worth the money.  \nGreatly disappointed in the food, the service was wonderful but not the food.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The service is perfect! Our glass was never even half empty! The steak is perfect! It is making my mouth water just thinking about it now. Yes it is $50- ish for a steak- but it is totally worth it! They even sent out a little green tea ice cream treat to say "happy anniversary."
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A fancy steakhouse with minimal decor, Delmonico's was recommended as the best place for steak in Vegas by several people.  Everything was very tasty and well seasoned, but we didn't find the food to be spectacular as expected.  Not sure if it was all the alcohol we have been consuming the past 2 days, but none of us could finish out 16 ounce steak - which was a damn disgrace in our books.  Though overall the experience was good, we doubt we would return anytime soon because there are just so many other steakhouses in the city to try out.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Story to say, this is not where you should spend your money.  The waiter asked my wife how she liked her salmon cooled!  Then it came out with BBQ sauce on it and the salmon was not cooked through.  I ordered gumbo.  The shrimp was frozen and over cooked and mediocre at best.  Not what I would expect from a chef from the south.  Bad experience and would never repeat.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I've been to Delmonico's twice. Both times have been awesome. The wait staff is always very attentive and genuinely nice. They are also very knowledgeable about the menu and are happy to answer any questions one may have.\n\nThe truffle parmesan potato chips are downright addictive and the steaks(I've only had the filet mignon) are delicious and well-cooked. The sides are delicious. What else can I say - Delmonico's is the best!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I really wanted to love this place, but honestly...well...\nFor starters, I was a single, attractive woman, dining alone when there was a giant computer convention at the Venetian. Why oh why would you seat me in a dark, partitioned corner??\nThen my dirty martini came, and it was...warm. \nAnd my iceberg wedge salad was tasty, but soggy. \nMy bone-in ribeye was enormous and glorious, but not exactly warm. \nAnd my tawny port looked awfully ruby. \nAll in all my experience was uninspired.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I had the bone-in rib-eye, which is the best steak I've had in my life. Deliciously juicy, tender, full of beef flavor, with just the right amount of bite, the thought of this steak is making me salivate while writing this review.\n\nMy friend had his with the foie gras. If you like foie gras at all, DO THIS. It might seem a bit odd to pair these two together, but when I tried it, it set off little fireworks off my taste buds.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	If you are looking for the best steak you have had, and a fine dining experience, the team at Delmonicos will not let you down.  We had the table side Caesar and the rib-eye and filet, and we were in heaven.  Go here!!!!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	After eating at Delmonico, I seriously didn't want to eat for days! I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my my, it was humongous. I finished the whole thing (no, not the bone also). It was a really delicious piece of meat. It was cooked medium rare perfectly. As if the steak wasn't rich enough for us... we decided to add on the seared foie gras. Very good piece of fat! For the sides, we ordered the corn, cream of spinach, broccoli and buttered asparagus. Much needed to counter the meat. \n\nService was excellent as you expect it to be. I really enjoyed this place and it is great for a fancy dinner one of your nights in Las Vegas. Note that you probably don't want to do anything after. Food coma to the maxxxxxxxxxxxxx!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	My must stop at Vegas. Highly recommend to anyone who appreciate a good steak. And try the BBQ shrimp as well. You won't be disappointed.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We went here for brunch, the service was impeccable.  Our waters was filled without asking, food came in steady stream, they checked on us consistently but not to the point where it gets uncomfortable.  We had the tiger shrimp with avocado and chicken gumbo as appetizers.  The shrimp was so good, super sweet and fresh.  Chicken gumbo was good too and I'm not even a gumbo type of person.   \nMy SO and I both had the Prime Burger as our main course, and wow the burger was huge!  My SO is a pretty big eater and he could only finish 2/3 of the burger.  I had half of mine left over, I desperately wanted to finish it though.  The burgers were very rich, meaty, and just everything that a good burger should be.  \nI didn't give this place a 4 star because of our short trip to vegas we couldn't go back to eat dinner, but we'll be back soon and hopefully I can give this place a 5 star.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I'm hardly ever in Vegas, and when I am here it's #rage before #forage (hah, hah), so I must admit that I've only tried a handful of Vegas' steakhouses. \n\nHowever, what I can tell you is that Delmonico's BONE IN RIBEYE ($55) is absolutely divine. One of the best ribeyes I've ever had, LA and Vegas combined.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	went for a bachelor party dinner in oct 08...so amazing! service could not have been any better. sides were amazing, but if you get the rib eye..you wont need them. manager came to our party to make sure everything was as we liked. very impressive.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4.5 stars\n\nPerfect decor, service, and noise level. \n\nCONS: didn't like the crab n spinach special and the choc bread pudding. (Way too thick and sweet) (MINUS HALF STAR)\n\nPROS:\n\n-HOLY MOLY awesome lobster bisque. With lumps of lobster tail. FOODGASM? check.\n\n-Amazing signature bone-in rib steak. OMFG juicy and flavorful from first til the last bite. REALLY HUGE portion. FOODGASM? oh yes,check!!! ding ding ding!!!\n\n-Really good fliet and lobster. But bone in rib steak just blows my mind that I didnt want to "waste my stomach space" with the bf's entree. Surf n turf FOODGASM? ummmmmmmm... let me go back to my bone in rib steak.... OH YES!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AMAZING. The food speaks for it's self &I the service was beyond amazing. Will not be disappointed.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I really enjoyed the medium-rare rib eye as it was seasoned and cooked to perfection, but what I enjoyed even more were the pork chops!  Bone in tender chops cooked barely pink covered in a delicious, light sauce.  I'm getting moist just thinking about it.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	One of my real first fine dining trips in Las Vegas and I was not disappointed!\n\nLet's start out by saying Delmonico was very accommodating despite showing up late the staff was really nice with the exception of the blonde chick that seated us. Décor very simple ambiance very romantic but still a lively and fun place to have dinner with friends. \n\nFood\nAppetizers - Jumbo Crab Cake - SOOOOO YUMMY I think this is the best I've had so far! The pieces of crab was huge!\nAppetizers - Truffle Potato Chip Things - OHHH This is potato chips on steroids ohh soooo yum.\n\nEntrée - I had the filet mignon was good perfectly cooked and marinated I asked for the house sauce but realize I didn't need it. My friend had the Rib eye and boy did that blow my mind. One bite and I fell in love with it. I would have eaten his whole steak but realized I had mine to finish.\n\nSides - Mushrooms - Ehh\nSides - Potato Gratin - So So So\n\nDessert - Banana Cream Pie and Crème Brulee by dessert I was pretty stuffed but I managed to get my dessert down it was pretty damn good. \n\nI would definitely come back here again
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Delmonico lives up to its reputation (and prices). A true fine dining experience. Service was attentive and helpful. Bbq shrimp are a New Orleans classic and you should try them if you never have. Bone in ribeye was one of the best steaks I have ever had. The duck special was also very expertly prepared.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I would give this 4.5 stars if I could. My husband and I sat at the bar for a couple snacks. We ended up getting Emeril's red wine blend, which was surprisingly good and $9. Not too bad for Vegas. We also got his bbq shrimp and gumbo. Both were really good. I loved the little biscuit that came with the shrimp. The sauce with the shrimp was a rich deep color with lots of flavor. Not your traditional BBQ shrimp. The gumbo wasn't spicey, but had a nice flavor. We also got complimentary "sweet" rolls (maybe yeast?) with our shrimp and gumbo. They were SOOO good! Great experience!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is my favorite restaurant in the United States, bar none.\n\nSome of the best service and atmosphere I've ever seen in a restaurant, anywhere. For example....\n\nA few days before one visit, I called to request that the Peanut Butter Cream Pie, a dessert special from a past trip, be once again on the desert menu. When we showed up for dinner, we didn't see the pie on the menu, but were informed that the chef had made and saved an ENTIRE pie just for our party. It was unbelievable.\n\nAnd oh the food....\n\n** Warning: this meal is a marathon. If you're not a big eater, don't be afraid to share appetizers, order smaller steaks, skip the rolls, etc so that you can room for all parts of this amazing, amazing meal.\n\n**** Appetizers ****\n-- Lobster bisque is the clear ungodly standout.\n-- All the salads are routinely excellent.\n-- Skip the tuna tartare and tomato soup -- they aren't as impressive.\n-- The free rolls are really, really excellent.\n\n**** Wine ****\n-- For those that (like me) enjoy wine but aren't connoisseurs, the Fisticuffs cabernet is my go-to. It goes great with all steaks at a reasonable ($55) price.\n\n**** Steak ****\n-- Ribeye is the obvious play, and is amazing (and huge), but the filet is outstanding for those who want something smaller and not quite as rich.\n-- Try Au Poivre style for really powerful flavor. Steak purists should do the ribeye straight up, but those who like peppery and lightly sweet flavors would love the filet au poivre.\n-- I am told that they serve entrees besides steak, but I have never, ever seen anyone be so misguided as to come here and fail to order a steak.\n\n**** Sides ****\n-- Usually we have one person order all the sides for the group, just to make sure we get a good mix of them so everyone can try everything. They're served family-style, and are big enough for ~3 people to have some.\n-- Twice baked potato (which has gratuitous amounts of cheese and bacon) is incredible, albeit heavy. Two can share, but my friends insist on ordering their own.\n-- Mushrooms are some of the best I've had, and go perfectly with the steak.\n-- Broccoli or asparagus is a good choice to contrast the rich steak.\n\n**** Desserts ****\n-- Oatmeal pecan pie is one of my favorite desserts anywhere. You will want a whole one yourself after one bite, so order accordingly.\n-- Banana cream pie is well known and hyped, for good reason. It is also enormous.\n-- Skip the bread pudding and peach cobblers -- they're good but not in the same league.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	I have been fortunate enough to dine at many upscale steakhouses across the country. This is by the best I have ever been to! The service, food and experience are incredible! When I visit Las Vegas, this restaurant is a priority during my trip. If you have not been, it is a must! You will not be disappointed. Best steak ever!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great steak. \nGood service and atmosphere and accomodated our large group.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	OMG !!!!!!!!!!!!! Hands down the best dinning experience I've ever had had the bone in rib eye was absolutely to die for. Enjoyed the 5 cheese platter several drinks and the strawberry sorbet all were of the finest quality. My girlfriend had the salmon which was also cooked to perfection we both enjoyed the twice baked potato for our sides  which was the best I've ever had. Food, service, and attention to detail were absolutely the best
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Ordered the bone in ribeye, medium rare.  The first steak came out medium.  I was nervous to ask the waiter for a redo but he was so gracious and even acknowledged the medium steak.  It was replaced with a gorgeous medium rare steak in less than 5 mins.  Great service, good food, excellent atmosphere.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	In town for business, had several great meals. However tonight I am eating alone and craving a nice piece of prime cut. I chose this restaurant based on rating and expected value. \n\nOrdered the bone-in prime ribeye, a signature dish, asparagus and a glass of house red. \n\nThe service was excellent for the entire meal. The table bread was good but in my opinion was really better suited for breakfast or needed gravy like Yorkshire pudding. The house red (a cab) was excellent, sorry forgot what I ordered, but it was the least expensive but was very good. \n\nWas served quickly, if I had clients with me I would hope for a little slower pace but alone the speed was appreciated. \n\nThe asparagus was perfect, not over cooked or smothered with too much butter, and very tender. The ribeye however came up very short, lacked taste and was tough, not what you would expect from aged prime ribeye. The waiter respond quickly and offered a new steak, I decided on the filet. I was served as fast as possible, the new steak rectified the problem, perfectly charbroiled, taste and texture as expected. Also served fresh asparagus. \n\nDessert, ordered the pecan tart and a cap. Both very good. The pecan very tasteful, the filling was not too runny or too sweet and the pecans were fresh with a deep southern taste. The crust was very favorable and went well with the Carmel and house made ice cream and whipping cream. \n\nOther notes, good lighting and I liked the architectural ceiling. Chairs are stylist and very comfortable. I recommend adjusting the traffic flow, two much weaving required and not ideal for guest seated in wrong location. Never like sitting near restroom entrance, which I was; as much as I like most people watching I would of asked to be moved if with clients or my spouse. Lastly white sugar cubes, really?
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Made reservations for Delmonico, and was looking for a great steak and experience.  This place delivered!  The decor and architecture of the restuarant is unique and modern; it really provides a class of it's own.  The service was superb; not in your face, but they didn't leave you hanging in terms of wanting.  The steak was perfect.  Enough said.  You want a good steak, you expect a good steak, and they deliver a great steak.  Their wine selection is above standard, and the servers are well educated on assisting you.  If you are looking for a night out, white table cloth, good food, classy place; then this is your place.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Incredible meal and dining experience. In addition to a fantastic steak, the lobster bisque and twice baked potato are a must try!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	UPDATE - \n\nDelmonico / Emeril's staff reached out to me via Yelp a couple of days after I posted the review, and I ended up having a good conversation with their Director of Operations in Las Vegas.  Mike told me he reviewed the events of the evening with the staff at Delmonico, including the mistakes that were made and ways to ensure it doesn't happen in the future.  He asked that I give them another chance and let him know when I'm going to be in Vegas again, which I most certainly will. \n\nI'm very impressed with their response and how they took the review as an opportunity to improve. \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW - \n\nOne of the worst high end Las Vegas restaurant experiences I've ever had.\n\nDinner started out alright.  Larger party of 15, restaurant spread us across 2 tables instead of handling us as one; acceptable, but not thrilling. Initial greeting with menus and wine lists was prompt and fast. \n\nAfter that, follow up service to get drink orders and appetizers was very slow. Orders were finally taken and again, return to deliver the drinks took a while. \n\nWhen time came to order, my wife and I were among the first in the group.  I ordered a tableside Caesar for 2, a Special bone in filet medium rare for my wife and a special bone in filet blue (think less cooked than rare, if you don't know it) for myself. \n\nThe pop-overs are fantastic, and the tableside Caesar was great. The gentleman who prepared it was kind enough to give me a couple of hints how they do the Caesar dressing which I'm looking forward to trying in my own Caesar dressing. \n\nAt this point, the wheels came off the bus. I finished my glass of wine with the Caesar and tried repeatedly to signal our waiter John for another glass and failed. My wife got into trying to get his attention as well and failed multiple times before finally succeeding. \n\nRough bus, meet out of control bus. Dinner arrives, and my wife and I are simultaneously served Bone In Ribeyes. Hers medium rare, mine blue (our order was Filets - medium rare and blue). We promptly object and are corrected at first by the waitstaff that we got what we ordered (we never order Ribeyes as we both like our steaks too rare for a ribeye's flavor to come out).\n\nThe waiter comes over after some confusion and tells me he brought me what I ordered. After some quick discussion our incorrect steaks are removed and we're told our Special of the evening, Bone In Filets, are on their way. \n\nNot minutes later, we're told they've sold out of the special and we can have regular filets. Since the rest of our group has already been eating we just say fine, whatever, bring us a medium rare and a blue filet. \n\nThree different people drop by to apologize to us, a total of 8 times across them. Frankly it creeped us out a bit. \n\nWhen our new steaks finally arrived, they sat them down saying "here is your medium and rare filets".  When we cut in to them, we did get 1 medium and 1 rare filet but 0 medium rare and 0 blue filets. We just accepted them and went forth. \n\n The flavor of the filets were good, as was the texture and seasoning. \n\nAfter the steak disaster, I did not have to struggle to get another glass of wine fortunately!!\n\nI can't say the side of grits with cheese and bacon was all that great since it sat there getting cold and congealing the whole time they were figuring out the steak issue. \n\nWe passed on dessert, having lost all confidence on the restaurant. We did order a decaf coffee and a 10 year tawny port for me. The waiter offered to buy the port for me, i.e. comp it, but that seems a small consolation compared to blowing the whole main course in such an epic fashion. \n\nCan't recommend you avoid Delmonico enough. With so many other options around here, don't risk wasting your hard earned dollar (or luckily won one) here.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The prime rib was excellent and, to literally top it off, I ordered foie gras to complement the fantastic steak. Great ambience, great service, overall a great dining experience.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Fantastic food, great wine and amazing service, what more can you ask for. Frank, our server, was top notch, knowledgeable and friendly. Steaks were exceptional and don't miss the BBQ shrimp appetizer.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Ok, this is a lunch review..... I have had many burgers in my day and let me tell you, THIS IS THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. It takes around 20 minutes to prepare, so bring your patience with you....the beef that they use must come from heaven, because this burger is so tender juicy and flavorful.... I could eat another one right now... or maybe half... Thats about all I got through on this....  Its HUGE.....  its $18 bucks and I really didnt care at all when I paid because i felt like this was wellllll worth the money.....  and definitely order the Parmesan chips with truffle oil.... fantastic!!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	They have the absolute best lobster bisque I've EVER had.  I would eat here again just for this.  The banana pie was amazing as well.  We had about half the sides and appetizers at the table and these were all great too.\n\nSadly, our steak came out way too raw.  We asked for medium and it was seriously raw inside.  Restaurant was great with the error though, even the manager came over to us and made sure we didn't want anything else or a new steak after we told our waiter we were ok and didn't really need a replacement (we were pretty full and were just going to split the original steak).  We were not charged for the steak.\n\nI would eat here again.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great customer service but not so great steaks .  My husband ordered the $50 bone in rib eye and it was soo chewy and full of fat .  I ordered New York steak and it was okay for $60.  I rather go to Mastro where it beats all the steakhouse restaurants I ever been to.  Don't waste your money and time here.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	"WOW!!!" that's what she said... literally! lol, actually that's what we all said after we took our first bite into the appetizer (bbq shrimp). Let me back track a little bit though. I made a reservation for four on open table... we were running a little late so I called and to let them know. They were very friendly and accommodating with our late arrival. As soon as we get there, they said "You must be Jason, party of 4 correct?" Very nice touch for a first impression. We were greeted by our main server, followed by the assistants. Our server made good conversation and awesome recommendations. We never felt bugged, rushed, or belittled (since we all look pretty young). Even with the huge wine list, we were scratching our heads and our server recommended a VERY good syrah that fitted within our budget.\n\nBetween the 4 of us, we ordered the bbq shrimp, filet mignons, lobster tail, and I ordered the rib eye. Seriously, every bite was WOW! Cooked to exactly the way you ask!!! You have to try it for yourself and you'll understand the WOW factor this restaurant has!\n\nWhile making my reservations, I noted that it was a special dinner for me and my wife, along with my friend and his wife (our anniversaries of dating). lol...anyways, when we were about to ask for our check, the staff came out with two bowls of fresh strawberry sherbert/sorbet with a candle in it, followed by the words "Happy Anniversary to you both and Thank You for coming to Delmonicos"! I wanted to stand and applaud! hahahah Our server then went on to take our digital camera's and take a couple pics of us.\n\nIf you're looking for a restaurant with that WOW factor (and you love meat), I highly recommend visiting Delmonico's.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Being a fan of the Food Network and chef Emeril Lagasse, my girlfriend (fiance the next day!) reserved us a dinner date to this place. I was excited but then again curious on why it was it was so expensive. They must serve some really good cow I thought!\n\nAnyways, the website said the dress code to be business casual/fine dining. We dressed up but saw a few people came in with shorts and a shirt. They seated us towards the side which was kinda of private from the crowd. It was romantic and our waiter was really nice since we asked for it.\n\nWe started off with a bottle of Cabernet. I don't remember if we had any appetizers or not. If we did, I didn't remember therefor it wasn't a "wow" factor. For the main course, I had the filet minion where as my fiance ordered the famous boned rib-eye. We also ordered some asparagus and gratin potatoes on the side which was excellent. My medium filet was cooked to perfection. When they brought out the rib-eye, we were like, "whoa!" It was huge... Once she digged in, she couldn't keep her knife off it. It was so juicy and delicious! I was actually eying her rib-eye the whole time. We actually swapped our dishes half way. She is generous like that. :). After being buzz off the wine, and bloated off the food, we finished it off with the creme brulee. It just hit the spot...\n\nThe check came out to be around $250. It was well worth it and I will definitely be coming back here in the future.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We had scheduled our wedding dinner reception here. The whole process with them seemed difficult from the start.  Eventually we needed to start our dinner 30 minutes later than we first anticipated. We knew this at least a month before the event, but they could not accommodate us and make the change, which seemed ridiculous ... a half hour later, come on?\n\nWe ended up having the dinner reception at Postrio instead. It couldn't have turned out better and they were very easy to work with. \n\nI've dined at both locations on separate occasions, and I have to say my food was better at Postrio both times.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This restaurant was top notch. The food was tremendous and so was the service. The atmosphere was sophisticated and simple at the same time. I highly recommend this restaurant for a formal dinner.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	i had a delicious meal here. i came here a few weeks ago for a business dinner and had a nice experience. i didn't like the wine, but that's my fault, not theirs!\n\ni ordered a salad of sorts to start, and then i had the bone-in rib eye. normally i find a steakhouse doesn't put a rib eye and a bone-in rib eye on their menu, but for whatever reason, Delmonico's has both. my steak was incredible. it was so juicy and prime. to accompany it, we ordered mashed potatos and also asparagus, both of which were very good.\n\nalso, for dessert, the espresso gelato is a must. the next time i'm in vegas, i'll certainly return to delmonico's.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Oh. My. God.\n\nTook hubby here for our 1 yr. anniversary/my hubby's b-day.  I wasn't hungry (late lunch) so I had a (delicious) salad and wine, and he got a bourbon, the filet with creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes.  From the second we got there till we left they treated us like royaly.  Ross, the manager, came and chatted with us at our table, offering an appetizer on the house because of our big day.  They even plated my year-old wedding cake top tier, frozen for a year and in a bag for 6 hours on a plane from NY, and presented it to us with candles on a small table with plates and forks.  The filet, by the way, almost brought me to orgasm with a single bite.  Seriously.... no, seriously.  It was prob the best single bite of beef I've ever experienced.\nWhat else.... the year-old cake was surprisingly good! (I baked it myself) :)\nOf course it's a killer bill at meal's end ($135 for everything I mentioned above and nothing more) but worth every penny, y'all.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	The food is outstanding. The service is amazing. The truffle chips are to die for. Their caesar salad is incomparable. Steak and shrimp is great as well.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Steak was awesome but very pricey ..service not so good thet need  to  work on that..
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	LAS VEGAS...i have so many unforgettable memories...\n\ni first came to this sin city on a cold winter night with my college roommates.  the youngest of us had just turned 21 and we needed to prove we were adults.  back then, new york new york was the hottest hotel on the strip and we went crazy, imitating diana ross and the supremes (i would say we were the original "dreamgirls" and i have pictures to prove it).  we couldn't afford a lobster for each person, so we shared 1 among 4 of us. we were young, naive, dirt poor and shameless.  \n\nsummer in vegas is a miserable time, and my sisters and i braved that heat by looking at the bellagio water fountain in awe.  that water show is still the favorite part of my trip every time i go to vegas.  of course, this all happened before "ocean's eleven" featured that famous last scene.  i don't think we looked as cool as brad and george though...\n\ni swore to myself that i'd never be back to this city after our incident at a club.  we got kicked out for having too much fun!!!  it was for a bachelorette party, and i think paris hilton was slightly jealous because we drew more crowd than her performance on that night.  we continued to party on in our suite and i discovered that night that jacuzzi could make even the most prude girl hot and steamy!!!\n\ni am no longer young nor have enough energy to party all night, but vegas proved to be a great place to have some of the finest dining experiences one can enjoy.  this time, our sole purpose of the trip was to eat at delmonico steakhouse, and what a fantastic night we had!!!\n\nsome of us had been here before, so the night started with the chef's complimentary appetizer which was a capane of smoke salmon on puff pastry.  a bottle of red wine was chosen from their extensive wine list along with fried calamari and barbecue shrimp as appetizers.  i can't make a comment on the wine, but the calamari had overwhelming amount of olives for my taste.  i did love the shrimp as they were cooked perfectly in that tangy sweet bbq sauce.\n\nsome of us were disappointed that the restaurant no longer offered pork chop, but the special of the night was pork tenderloin with braised bacon, and they happily opted for it.  a couple of us ordered a bone in filet, the bf ordered a bone in ribeye and i got a filet mignon.  my butterflied medium steak was perfectly charred outside with some pink inside and it was very tender and juicy.  i tasted the pork dish and i loved every part of it.  i never knew that a chunk of bacon could be so buttery and sweet, and the cane syrup they used to braise was just perfect for that white fatty meat.  the highlight of the night was the bone in ribeye.  that thing was huge with so much flavor!!!  i rarely eat any pink meat, but the bf's medium rare steak was so delicious i didn't care for the color of it.  seriously, if you ever get a chance to go to delmonico, get their bone in ribeye.  you'll thank me forever for the best steak ever!!!\n\nwe also ordered sauteed garlic mushroom and roasted fingerling potatoes.  it was a mushroom heaven with all different kinds of them (shiitake, button, oyster, portebello, etc) cooked in chopped garlic and the aroma itself could make someone's mouth watery.  those purple, yellow and red potatoes side dish was recommended by our maitre d' and it didn't disappoint us.  maybe it could be too heavy for a light eater with all that meat, but for a person like me (a meat & potato girl), i couldn't ask for a better meal.\n\ni must say this steakhouse is a place to impress someone.  it's a huge restaurant, but since it was sectioned into 3 different rooms, it rather felt intimate and quaint.  small tables were cornered so you could be private and although the restaurant was busy, i never felt rushed.  the waiters were not those friendly joker types, but the service we received was more than adequate and appropriate.  \n\ndelmonico renewed my faith in vegas.  i was impressed...i was happy...i was glad to be back to vegas where i have the good, the bad and the ugly memories of my "peak" time!  this dining experience (not just the food) tops as one of my favorite moments in vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Absolutely loved everything about this place.  My party of 6 chose this establishment to have our New Year's Eve dinner and the restaurant did not disappoint.  We were 20 minutes late for our 8:30pm reservation since we were stuck trying to squeeze through the NYE crowd from 2 hotels down.  The host didn't think anything of it and was able to seat us right away.\n\nI had ordered the filet mignon and shared the side of the perfectly steamed and buttered asparagus that could serve up to 4 people.  I ordered my filet medium rare and it was definitely medium rare as our helpful and attentive waiter, Ryan, had described it.  The other dishes my dining companions had were the pepper-seared ahi tuna, grilled petite beef medallions, and spicy jumbo shrimp with fresh fettucine pasta.  All of which they loved.  \n\nThe dessert lovers shared the warm apple crisp and the chocolate brioche bread pudding.  It was the first chocolate bread pudding I had and once I dug into the soft center, I fell in love....\n\nAt the end of dinner, not having a calculator, Ryan noticed I was struggling a bit to calculate everyone's portion of the bill and he kindly offered to split the bill 6 ways as I had specified to make things easier.... How nice was that?!  Excellent food, excellent service - highly recommend dining here.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Based on prior reviews, we tried the Chateaubriand cooked tableside for two. We were definitely not disappointed and the meat melted in my mouth. But the best part of this place is the impeccable service. Several different people attended to us throughout the night and topped it all off with a complimentary dessert to celebrate our honeymoon!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Given the big name attached to this place (Emeril), and based on a friend's recommendation, I had high hopes. Sadly, the name here is just a facade for mediocre food and service.\n\nI made reservations via Yelp/OpenTable to treat my girl to a nice dinner on our first "just us" trip to Las Vegas.\n\nIt was a cold night and she had decided to wear a heavy coat. When we arrived, neither the host or hostess offered to take her coat. I then asked them to take her coat and they responded that Delmonico's doesn't offer a coat check. Strike one.\n\nThe hostess seated us at a table that had obviously already been reserved for us, as two of the chairs at the four-person table had been removed. That was a small, but nice touch.\n\nI had expected Delmonico's to have a dress code, but there were plenty of patrons in jeans and polo shirts. I almost want to strike the restaurant for that, but I understand it is Vegas and they have to cater to a variety of customers. But it does take the ambiance down a notch.\n\nThe waiter appeared promptly and introduced himself (Renee, I believe it was). I had to ask for the wine list. Why should I have to *ask* for the wine list? Strike two.\n\nRenee did not go over any of the specials with us. He also mentioned that two other servers would be assisting them, but he did so when they weren't there. So when one of them came by later, we had no idea which of the two assistants he was.\n\nThe assistant pretty much took over at that point, and we only saw Renee once again (with the bill). The assistant asked to take our order before we even saw the wine list.\n\nThis wasn't turning out to be the pampered, high-quality service that I had come to expect based on my experiences at other fine dining establishments.\n\nOur food came out fairly quickly; almost too quickly. We had barely received the wine when our appetizers arrived. She had the lobster bisque which was very thin and only contained about 1oz of lobster. I had the duck prosciutto flatbread. The duck was overcooked and still had a layer of skin and fat that was rubbery.\n\nAlmost instantly after we finished our appetizers, the main entrees arrived as if they had been waiting around the corner with the dishes to spring out as we took the last bites of our appetizers.\n\nShe ordered the filet and I had the bone-in rib-eye. Both of the cuts were of good quality but were ruined by an over-seasoning of creole spices. Both steaks were ordered medium rare and came out cooked perfectly.\n\nThe sides left much to be desired. Many of the choices were bland and uninspiring. The broccoli was simply steamed with no seasoning or oils added. The potato gratin contained too much garlic.\n\nThe speed of the service and delivery of the meal was too fast. We finished dinner within 1 hour. Strike three.\n\nTotal damage, including wine ($120 for the bottle) and tip, came to ~$340. We've had much, much better fine dining experiences (and food) for less.\n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a classy, upscale meal. It's just a touristy, over-priced restaurant with a celebrity chef's name tied to it.\n\nThere are many better options available in Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Finally made me give up on Emeril's restaurants.  We were some of the first customers at Emeril's at Universal Studios here in Orlando, which was OUTSTANDING when it first opened and the first few visits after that.  Then it started going downhill - poor service and bad food.  It was so bad, we swore we wouldn't frequent any of Emeril's restaurants ever again.  Then we were in Vegas and at the Palazzo looking for a place to eat.  We foolishly decided to give Delmonico a try.  Worst service we've had in a long time.  The waiter acted like we were bothering him.  He disappeared after dropping the menus and wine list on our table.  When he finally showed back up and I ordered a glass of wine (he didn't offer drinks when he dropped the menus on the table), I didn't get it for a good 10 minutes.  If I had been by myself, I would have walked out, but my wife didn't want to do that.  Dinner showed up and we started to eat.  My glass of wine ran out, with absolutely no sign of our waiter.  I finally had to flag down another waiter to ask for my wine.  Truly pathetic.  Food-wise, I don't know where the other reviewers have been having their steaks, but I have no clue why they would say these are the best steaks they've ever had.  It was OK, but certainly not worth the price we paid (and, trust me, I don't mind spending money in a restaurant).
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place is horribly overrated.  Service was terrible.  They act like they don't want you there.  It took 45 minutes between the first course and the main entree for the food to come out and not once did any waiter come by to check on the table.  Do not go.  Plenty of other great steakhouses in Vegas.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We returned to Vegas to celebrate my wife and my 15th wedding anniversary.  We chose to go to Delmonico Steakhouse because when we first began dating our first real date was at Emeril's in Vegas.  We booked a reservation via open table for 5 pm, we arrived around 4:30 and was told they would begin seating at 5 and we could wait in their lounge area.\n\nOur servers were Ryan and Anthony and they did a spectacular job making us feel welcome and catering to our needs.\n\nI had the bone in Rib Eye and my wife ordered the Rack of Lamb both were dialectic and cooked how we ordered them. We also had the creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes.  The creamed spinach was very good.\n\nTo top it off because I had mentioned it being our anniversary on OpenTable when I booked the reservation we were surprised to receive a special little tasting to begin our dining experience and a scoup of their chocolate gellato for dessert.\n\nOverall it was a great evening to remember.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This is a steak house/sports bar. I had the rib eye. It was grilled exactly how I ordered it....med rare. Lots of tv's to enjoy any sports event. Overall a very nice place, can't wait to go back!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Awesome steak and great service. Sometimes in Vegas you get the snobby attitude and mediocre food. Here I got an unreal steak and great service. It is pricey, but it's Vegas! Everything is pricey!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4.5 Stars \nDelmonico does not disappoint! \n\nI had the wonderful luck of visiting Delmonico for my birthday dinner in Vegas. I was beside myself with excitement to try an Emeril restaurant! \nPrior to our 8:30 reservation, we sat in the lounge to take pictures and have a drink. Our hostess came to get us when our table was ready. \nWe were greeted by our friendly waitress (her name escapes me) and were all seated quickly. She took our drink orders and delivered them quickly. She let me peruse the VAST wine list at my leisure and explained the specials of the evening and gave the market price of the items on the menu. \n\nI decided on the bone-in rib steak with broccoli and bacon cheddar grits. In the meantime, I ordered a bottle of Klinker Brick Zin and our EVER observant, and discreet waitress whispered in my ear to inquire on the preference on whether I would like her to present the bottle just to me or would I like her to present it to the rest of my drunk and (embarrassingly) rowdy guests. What a professional. I won't even get into how I handled the two of my 4 dinner partners and their TERRIBLE manners, but let's just say I won't be seeing them anymore. \n\nFinally, dinner arrived. My steak was beautiful. Well, cooked, not quite as rare as I had hoped, ah well. A rare steak seems to throw cooks, I don't get it. The sides were HUGE and beautiful. The broccoli was fresh and not over steamed so they still had a slight crunch to them. My bacon and cheddar grits were so rich and savory. I could only have a few bites of them before my stomach couldn't take anymore. Delmonico was nice enough to deliver chocolate ice cream at the end and wish me a happy birthday! What a lovely ending to a chaotic dinner! \n\nI hope to enjoy Delmonico again soon, and with better dinner partners!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Make sure you get reservations, this place was PACKED. \n\nService level is great, which is one of the reasons I'm sure it was so highly rated.\n\nI only had some fabulous red wine and the filet, so I can't attest for anything else but everyone in my party enjoyed our meal.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This place is consistently spectacular in terms of food and service. Polished and professional, the service is hard to fault. The wonderful table side caesars salad to the gumbo to the perfectly cooked steaks, they know what they are doing.\n\nDelmonico has been around quietly for a long time. It has always been and still is a great restaurant.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Let me start off by saying that I am a huge foodie LOVE all of Emerils restaurants. I started off by ordering the wilted spinach salad with bacon vinaigrette that was absolutely to die for that I ended up licking the plate. They also did a very cool soft-boiled egg that was then fried and one of the first I'd ever seen and pull it off perfect.  My main dish was perfectly cooked and super tasty ( the barbecued salmon dish).  It was served on top of a bacon potato hash and I ordered the cream corn as a side dish.  Yum yum yum!!!  I wanted to put that potato hash in my pocket and take it home!. I would highly recommend this for anyone coming in and if my review were only based on this then I would give it a five star!  Unfortunately it's not...The other four people in our party decided to order steaks and all of them disliked them...I am from Texas so I never make the mistake of ordering a steak outside of Texas because I am almost always let down.  Our server was mean and did not do her job well. She seemed that it was almost more of an annoyance when we wanted to order anything!  I hate to say it but come on, You're in Vegas as a high end server....The wait time in between drink orders seemed extremely longer than normal and when the manager finally came over to address the steaks, he did nothing....Even though my food was perfect the whole experience was just off-putting and The Decour of the restaurant needs a major overhaul. Bland and boring....I also found it very unprofessional that they had about 15 chairs stacked in the hallway between the restaurant on your way to the bathroom....anyway I hate giving this restaurant only two stars but I want everybody to know...
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	This was probably the highlight on my last Vegas trip.\n\nI read a few reviews from some of my favorite Yelpers about their experience in this place. Truth to be told, I was little envy, but was also very excited to finally get to go here after missing out two years ago.\n\nI'm not really big on name of a chef nor do I care about so much about the branding of the place. Here's the funny thing.... I was excited in going to Dan Marino's place only because it was in HOOTERS. \n\nSee, it really doesn't amount to much.\n\nMy dining companion and I made a lunchtime reservation after realizing we couldn't squeezed all the places we wanted to go on this trip. We had already set up a reservation for dinner at Bouchon (at the same hotel at the Venetian) later on the night, so we compromised and reserved a table for Delmonico's for lunch.\n\nIt was an adventure finding place along the restaurant row. We had a harder time finding Bouchon later on the evening, but to get it out the way....this place is next to Aquaknox and the entrance is all the way towards the end of the hall.\n\nThe place was specular. Very classy and refine by the elegance of the look to the place. it's a bit more than what I expected for a fine dining. I guess I was assuming steakhouse in the form of Morton's, but this place outdone itself by making it more classier and upscale than any of the Morton's.\n\nFor lunch, it was casual. Not dressy as it was listed in the profile.\n\nThe lunch menu was very limited. I was almost going to be sorely disappointed because the menu's best item was dry beef sirloin. However my mood was lifted when the waitress presented us with steak menu that normally is on the dinner, but will be serve at lunch as well. \n\nThat was a big relief because I did not want to get stuck with dry aged beef. I proceeded to order Filet Mignon for myself while my partner in crime decided to take one of their special. \n\nThe coolest thing I saw on the menu was a Truffle Parmesan Potato Chip for appetizer. It was a great start to a great meal because I just couldn't get enough of that chip. What amazed me even more was the fact that it was a seasoned POTATO CHIP. Who else would be insane enough to order that for appetizer for $9?\n\nYeah...us!\n\nWe have gotten great service throughout our meal and gotten constant check up from the staff. Anywhere from our wait staff to refill our water and house baked bread (which included the butter with a shade of letter "D") to the chef who came to make sure that the steak was to my liking after changing for the better.\n\nI had ordered it Medium Well, the chef changed it to Medium/Medium rare because the meat was excellent cut that day and I guessed he didn't want to overcook the meat to lose the flavor. Honestly, that was a good decision on his part because the steak was that good. I savored every bite and the meat didn't drip of blood. That would have been too much, but luckily it wasn't.\n\nThe other thing I highly recommend to get was their creme of corn and lobster soup. That was rich in texture, very creamy without being too diluted. That soup itself would make a great meal if they decided to offer it in the menu as a large bowl. The soup was that good.\n\nFor $70, that was a fine meal and I have no regret. Even though the slot machines that was not far away was calling me all day.\n\nOur table was part of the wine tasting lounge. They have a few table that has an open window wall that overlooked the mall of restaurants. it makes it a nice people watching opportunity that scenesters would love. The bar and the lounge sofas are a bit high class for a normal wine tasters, but for the quiet soothing atmosphere this place presents, these things goes very well in that room.\n\nThere is a bigger dining room, but I think dinner would filled it up more. I suggest getting the table there next to the window so that people can watch you eat with jealousy....just kidding!\n\nTo my amazement, I didn't utter the famous catchphrase "Bam!" I might as well since I had a wonderful meal with steak that was cooked just right. if it was a romantic dinner, I would have gave it an awesome "Bam!" \n\nI would definitely try to make it back here again next time when I'm in Vegas.\n--------------------\nQuality: *****\nDecor: *****\nService:****\nAmenity: ****\nAmbiance: *****
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Awesome experience. We had the private Chefs table with a clear view of the kitchen. Personal chef and staff along with sommelier. WOW!!!! Very very cool experience!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Best house rib eye steak I have ever had.  The service is excellent.  Absolutely will come here again!!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ABSOLUTE MUST IN VEGAS! Loved everything my boyfriend and I got and the service was amazing! Seriously this place is amazing
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	When I think Delmonico, I think banana cream pie rather than steak. I don't really understand applying cajun rub to a perfectly decent, medium rare porterhouse cut. But I do understand a buttery crust filled with sweet, vanilla-banana pudding and stuffed full of ripe pieces of banana. The pie isn't as creamy as the yummy banana cream pie from Jongewaard's, but I think that may be because the banana to pudding ratio favors the bananas. Delmonico has one of my favorite banana cream pies and, now, is a regular stop during my visits to Vegas. Only 3 stars though because it's a self-proclaimed "steakhouse" and I didn't care for the steak.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	We have been wanting to check out Delmonico for a while now, and with it being Restaurant Week, it made sense to stop in!\n\nThey only had a lunch special, but there was a lot of variety, and the food was great! Service was top notch as well, with our glasses never hitting halfway with a smile.  Had to hit it with the 4 star, since some of the food was hit and some miss, but overall everything was good and a great value for RW.\n\nStarted off with a surprise amuse!\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#s2aCXocbqLcx3v6sl0_NZw\n\nThen the apps came out...The Heirloom Tomato Soup with Grilled Ricotta Cheese Sandwich was good! \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#ogoxihGvCtfmoq7L8TD1BA\n\nThe soup itself was a little rich and thick, not very soupy consistency, but it worked well with the delicious Ricotta Cheese sandwich! But I tried a few spoonfuls without the sandwich, and it didn't stand on its own.\n\nVine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#d9kt2ojPgUys4VgvTBOTOg\n\nConsisted of Burrata Cheese, Red Onion, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Balsamic Vinegar and Torn Local Basil.  The company liked it, but since I am not a fan of tomatoes, I didn't bother trying it.\n\nOn to the entrees!  The Grilled Skirt Steak Sandwich was great!\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#EWRi7UESqNjHjvYn0GlXLQ\n\nIt was on Ciabatta with Roasted Mushrooms & Onions, Horseradish Mayonnaise, Spinach and Truffle French Fries! The sandwich itself was great! The steak was a perfect and tender medium rare, with the horseradish mayo adding the perfect blend of awesome! The truffle fries were great as well, but their style of fries are a bit overcooked for my tastes. Seems like they are twice fried here...and everyone's was like this, so I know it wasn't by accident. Still good though!\n\nButternut Squash Ravioli :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#GQE0e9w2Ew-u0GzjA1SJjQ\n\nConsisted of Sage Brown Butter, Toasted Hazelnuts and Parmesan Cheese. Not bad...very creamy though.\n\nThe desserts were awesome! Emeril's Banana Cream Pie :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#EZOm9VBP7nhTaoF6PABi-A\n\nHad a Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings and Whipped Cream, and it was way to big to finish! Lots of chunks of banana, and the cream pie portion was rich and outstanding. \n\nThe Pecan Pie :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#2PfIwfb5F0JTL9DuO52Wyw\n\nHad an Oatmeal Shortbread Crust, French Vanilla Ice Cream & Caramel Sauce. It was good too! A bit better on the portion control here lol.\n\nAnyways, I want to make it back to check out their steak menu! Seems like they are a little less spendy than some of the others on the strip, with prices on aged beef starting in the high $40s.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Went there for lunch during the week and it was dead, I was a little worried, but the service was great and the fried chicken was unbelievable!
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Great steak but disappointing service for the price.  Went here for a friend's bachelor party.  We all got bone-in ribeyes medium rare (of course) with multiple sides and starters.  Unfortunately, mine came out clearly at medium well.  Which would be fine if I were not paying 50+ dollars to enjoy the wonderful dry-aged (etc., etc.) beef.  The steak still tasted good but not as great as it could have been.  I brought this to the attention of the waiter, who offered to bring me a new steak, but I did not wish to wait 15 minutes while my friends ate.  At the end of the meal, the waiter offered a free desert to make up for the steak, but we were all too full to enjoy one, so I declined.  No other offers were made to compensate for the overcooked steak (could have made any one of the drinks, appetizers or sides we ordered) and when the check arrived, the waiter had mistakenly added an extra bottle of wine to the tab (when brought to his attention, he removed it of course).  I know these are minor complaints, but having waited tables at much cheaper restaurants, I have found a way to make it up to a customer when mistakes were made.  I expect at least the same when a table is spending 400 dollars in your restaurant.  So all in all, the food was great, service good, but not up to par for the money you will spend.
--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	From being a staple and a visit every single time, lately the visits to Delmonicos have been less than fantastic. \n\nThe filet minion which they used to do perfectly and second to none now usually comes out either overcooked or undercooked. \n\nThe Caesar salad we loved is now a 50/50 shot. \n\nFinally and most disappointing is the $130 seafood tower which is probably the least value I've ever seen. Lobster tails where the meat sticks to the shell and a tuna cup which was really bad. \n\nThey still make the best vanilla ice cream. That's something. :)
