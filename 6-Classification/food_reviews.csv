mLwM-h2YhXl2NCgdS84_Bw	Great soul food period , it's get no better, come and get it. They have lamb too !! Chicken, ribs, bbq chicken and sides to boot !! Pure awesomeness !!
mLwM-h2YhXl2NCgdS84_Bw	South Florida resides on the east side of Charlotte inside of a convenience store....a little sketchy but the food is really good.  They serve breakfast all day(chicken and waffles, fish and grits, etc) lunch and dinner.  They are grilling chicken, ribs, and pork chops right in the parking lot and although I haven't tried the ribs, the grilled pork chops and chicken are perfectly cooked.  I also tried the fried chicken, green beans, lima beans, potato salad, stewed squash, and seafood salad...all excellent!  The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the Mac n cheese.  They also offer homemade desserts, fruit and salad.  Great addition to the soul food scene!
mLwM-h2YhXl2NCgdS84_Bw	So this place is in the c-store. A little skeptical of the atmosphere but go in the day time and it's alright.  My food was good . I had turkey wings yams and green beans.  Very good turkey wings. Yams were not to sweet just the way I like it.  Will try again.  Sometimes taking a chance works!
mLwM-h2YhXl2NCgdS84_Bw	Amazing food!! I can't believe it almost taste like my 100 year old grandfathers food, God rest his soul. Even though these guys are displaced and have opened up shop in Nubian Queens Restaurant, they did not let that come across in the food  they prepared! I'm a patron from here on out!
v2WhjAB3PIBA8J8VxG3wEg	My new ritual is drinking tea every night after dinner, rather than just in the morning. I'd never really found a good decaffinated tea that I liked; they all seemed so processed and gross. Until I ran across the Tea Emporium, that is.\n\nI was ambling along the Danforth and passed the Tea Emporium's newest storefront. The store is small, but very pleasant. As you'd imagine, it has a good selection of teapots and teacups for sale, as well as other tea-related accoutrements. \n\nTheir tea selection is outstanding. Also outstanding is the sweet employee who took a ton of time trying to understand what kind of teas I like and what time of day I wanted to drink said teas. She proceeded to open about 574 canisters so I could smell each and every one, and offered little commentaries on each one. I settled on a Rooibos herbal tea called "Rooibos Province Organic", a South African red bush tree blended with lavender, rose petals, black and red currants, raisins, and rosehip. It smelled divine and I can't wait to try it.\n\nThe teas are priced around $10.50-$12.00 for 100 grams; the minimum they'll sell is 50mg, so you do the math. I also purchased a handle-free tea cup for $7, which is important so you don't burn your mouth. Like Teavana, they also make all kinds of teas there for you, as well, from tea lattes to (real) iced tea. :-)
v2WhjAB3PIBA8J8VxG3wEg	These people know there stuff! They are not herbalists, but rather tea connoisseurs.  If you can find something the staff can not answer, They will ether try and find out for you or direct you to where you can find the info yourself. I admire this as I'm a no BS type of person. They were very helpful and friendly.\n\nThe store it's self looks cozy and inviting. It smells amazing as soon as you step in the door. I'll be returning soon.  :)
v2WhjAB3PIBA8J8VxG3wEg	Yes another tea place with a zillion varieties of loose leaf tea.\n\nI love the concept, don't get me wrong, but I just can't justify giving any of these place ridiculously high ratings because they are just all so similar and thus only A-OK in my books.\n\nThe Tea Emporium is a bit more old fashioned and kitschy looking, when compared to say, the David's Tea chain. They had lots of tea but not quite as many tea "accessories". \n\nYou can order single takeaway cups for $2.05. I tried an apple tea variety and it was ok. There's not really any seating inside so you'll have to get your tea to go.
v2WhjAB3PIBA8J8VxG3wEg	Having recently discovered the joy of drinking a delicious tea on a chilly day, stepping into this place early last night, on my way to dinner with a bunch of yelpers, was in a word fantastic.\n\nTea Emporium has an amazing selection of teas on the menu to enjoy freshly brewed on the spot, or take out...or you can buy their loose leaf teas to take home and enjoy.  Their menu of tea offerings seemed endless and believe me, I wanted to try them all.\n\nDuring my visit there last night, I ordered the Rooibos Vanilla and it was quite possibly the most delcious tea I've ever had...however, I also spotted another tea, African Queen, which I cannot wait to try next time I stop in.  It's more the likely to rival the one I had last night...can't wait!\n\nThe store itself is small, but very welcoming and nicely decorated.  They have a few seats for folks to sit and enjoy their tea, but I can't imagine it woudl accommodate more than 2 or 3 people comfortably.  The girl who served us was really nice and the ambiance was quite pleasant.\n\nIf their selection of teas isn't enough to make you a fan then you will certainly appreciate the beautiful tea cups and teapots they also have on offer.
v2WhjAB3PIBA8J8VxG3wEg	I'm a tea freak.  I've got about 40 or 50 canisters/packages of tea. Bagged tea/loose leaf.  I've got tea accessories.  I've got books about tea. I dream of doing a tea tour of Holland and Russia.   I like tea.\n\nI've been used to going to Chinatown 3 and Kensington and St. Lawrence Market for my tea hits.  Or NYC, but that's a bit of a trip when what I want is a new tea.\n\nFound this location of the Tea Emporium when a friend and I were looking for a beverage before dance class.  My friend was looking for a tea to make her MIL happy during their next visit.  I just needed tea to drink right then.\n\nThe lovely lovely woman running the shop that night directed me to the Swiss Schoko - chocolate, almonds and calendula on a black tea base.  Terrific with honey.   I started savouring while the staffer led my friend through variations of first flush Darjeeling (ranging in cost from about $15 - 50/100 gms - at the high end, they will sell 10 gms).  Terrific service and advice.  \n\nI'll be back at least once a week for a tea - and an occasional top up of a tea canister or two.
v2WhjAB3PIBA8J8VxG3wEg	As another recent tea convert, trying to break my afternoon coffee habit. An afternoon pot of their "Royal Earl Grey" made in a cheap and cheerful infuser from a local kitchen shop, and the world honestly comes more alive. It has got to be the most delicate and perfectly blended tea I have ever had. \n\nThey also have a 'creamed' Earl Grey, which I have yet to try, but I am working my way through their Chai teas one by one.\n\nSomething nobody noticed to say, is their actual tea. After the pot is done, I am always amazed at the complexities of the actual tea, once it is plumped back up. It's a virtual garden in most of them, and from what they said, they blend most of their teas themselves, by hand.\n\nTheir craftsmanship shows.
v2WhjAB3PIBA8J8VxG3wEg	I've been going to the Tea Emporium for years.  They are the ones who introduced me to tea in fact :)  The quality and the selection of teas here are just spectacular both for flavoured and non-flavoured teas.  This is a place for a real tea connoisseur -- David's tea is a fun place but the quality of the tea here is simply better.  The flavoured teas have better ingredients and the taste is not as chemical and in your face as David's tea (don't get me wrong I actually like David's tea for some teas but as a rule Tea Emporium has a lot more of really spectacular teas).  For non flavoured teas this shop wins hands down.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Count your fingers after they hand you a receipt.  I shop here mostly for meat. Started using their app for the Just for U deals.  3 out of 4 times they overcharge me (I don't get the coupon price or they give me the price and charge me for more units than I place on the belt).  I then have to wait at the customer service counter for a refund while the customer service person tries to convince me I was correctly charged.  Last time they gave me a cash refund but rounded down and stiffed me for the tax I paid. Nuff said.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Had a misunderstanding with a cake design when picked up a cake. The bakery manager really took charge and made my cake amazing and what i wanted!!!  Great place to get custom cakes!!!!!
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	General okay but no fry's when it comes to price and always have to wait in line. If no line you will probably have to ring a bell. Lol
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I sometimes stop at this Safeway because it is convenient. The reviews I have seen are correct, they need more staff (or) to staff at the appropriate times when it's busy. The lines are always super long and their customer service does lack. I do feel bad saying it lacks as the checker's are normally just as frustrated as the customers due to the never ending lines. \n\nI did also have a small incident with Pom Pomegranate Seeds (Pom is the brand.) I normally check all my expiration dates on anything that is perishable because there is nothing worse than pulling something from the fridge to eat it and it's gone bad. Anyway, I was in a rush and didn't look when I bought these and of course they had expired the week before. I will give it to the customer service desk, I took both tubs in that i bought the evening before and she promptly gave me my money back. Moral of this story: ALWAYS check your expiration dates. I was pleased with how she handled the return though, she did not give me any push-back which was a nice surprise. \n\nIf the management team can figure out the right number of checkers during certain hours this would definitely help their rating and my frequency for shopping here. \n\nSometimes a girl just don't have time to wait in long lines.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I keep going to this store because the customer service is spectacular for a grocery store. They go above and beyond to assist and help you out in anyway - they always ask if you need help finding anything - they offer assistance with carrying items - very knowledgeable of their store and where items are located.\n\nContrary to popular belief Safeway actually offers some of the best deals on grocery items I have seen compared to the other stores around my area such as Wal-Mart/Albertsons/Bashas etc. - They stay very competitive. I'm not sure how this store doesn't get a better rep? Customer service is really their number one goal, so if you have a problem don't be afraid to say something because they will help you solve it without belittling you such as what happens at most Wal-Marts. \n\n@Max C. - The checkout experience can be a little slow at times especially if you go to this particular store after 8pm and they don't have any self checkout lanes but they try to make the best of what they got. They also read your last name after finishing the order because it's trying to show you that they care, it's the little things that matter, if that is a bother for you then please head over to Wal-Mart.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	This place rarely has enough staff working.  Too many times, usually in the late afternoon on the way home from work, the longs are soooo long.  The rarely have more than 2 lines open meaning it is longer to get out of the store than it is to shop.  Never see the manager working nights to witness this operation.  I am afraid management is looking at sales reports and filling out the schedule based on numbers.  Unfortunately, customers are working out without buying anything once they see the long lines.\n\nHate shopping at this Safeway.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I avoid this place like the plague.  They are always slow in the check out area.  Rarely are more than 2 lanes open.  The parking lot is a mad house.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Horrible !!!! Only 2 lanes open and 5 people deep. I asked for another lane to be open and that took another couple of minutes total time in line 12 minutes. This is not the first second or third time this has happened it's every time I go in there. The management fucking sucks!!!!!! I asked to see the manager and he pretended to be oblivious to the situation.\nI asked him if he ever reads the store reviews and again he had "no clue" what I was talking about. This place is fucking ridiculous !!!! And definitely needs new management.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Terrible NEVER USE SAFEWAY GROCERY DELIVERY! \n\nMade an order, it never got delivered and per Maureen with Safeway Grocery customer Service my order was cancelled doesn't know why, but it was cancelled. Nothing they can/will do about it! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Oh and I was told yea we see you used a promo, you won't be able to use it again. Sorry wish there was something we could do....... NEVER AGAIN WILL I MAKE THIS MISTAKE! I will stick to shopping from FRYS food store and just do my order pick ups there! They don't let their customers down! They don't cancel orders for no reason, they have resolutions for their customers!!!
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	So it's not the most glamorous Safeway, but it's also not the worst. Its decent, average in size and close to my place! Friendly staff.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I really like this Safeway. It seems to be well organized and the selection of foods are pretty good. The last time I was here I got something from the hot case to eat for dinner and the fried chicken was okay. Nothing exciting. \n\nIt does almost never fail to be long lines when I am ready to check out...except for that one time I went after 10pm.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Good enough selection for just about anyone and overall a very clean place.  Service was very friendly and accomodated all requests.  Conveniently located near home nested with a variety of other stores in the same shopping center.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	This store sucks!!!!\n3's a crowd is crap. The only reason I went there because close to me\nI waited in line longer than I shopped\nRather drive 5 min down road to frys market place.   Nobody apologized for 15 min wait for a one item check out
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I can't tell you how many times I've been in this store when they had a line of customers at the ONE register they have open.  One evening I stopped after work and ended up in a line nine people long!  They did finally open one other register that time.  It's always slow, there's almost always only one register open and they don't have any self check-outs.  After 8 years of living here and coming to this Safeway periodically I think I'm done with this store.  There are 4 other grocery stores within 2 miles, don't waste your time here.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Absolutely HATE this safeway ..besides the fact that they are way understaffed & it's taken me as long as 20 min to check out ..they have the rudest cashiers I've ever seen ..and lazy !\nI only go here if it's a emergency! !!
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I want to say first I am not from his area and when I saw a Safeway I was happy because I know I have a Safeway card and I can use the just for you app. Not a problem. The place is beautiful.!! They need a better selection of food. I guess its just for that "area" but again it was not far from my new apartment. Now the Starbucks workers in there are very selective with who they speak to. Its like they were afraid or something. That automatically turned me off. Not to mention the cashier wouldn't even speak to and the girl who was bagging even walked away. I kid you not!!! I will go to the one that is even closer to me off Alma Rd their customer service sucks and that's all I need not to go. It was my first and last time. Safeway needs to do something about that.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	All the complaints about this Safeway being understaffed stems from the management being so awful to their employees. They have huge turnovers, people are hired and quit sometimes after their first shift. I did about three weeks of being talked down to, general rudeness, reminded that I could be fired at their whim...just an awful place to work. I found another job and purposely quit 10 mins before my next shift, it felt good.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I love Safeway in all ways except this one lacks in customer service.\n\nSafeway offers coupons plus bonus $5.00 items on Friday's!\n\nThis particular location has several customer service cashiers that lack happiness as I call it. Regardless of the day or night, they never seem happy and pleasant. I also don't like the fact that I have to wait in line regardless of the time of day. They never seem to have enough cashiers on duty. Weekends are the worse!\n\nHope it's just this location and not the norm!
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Checkout experience is very poor.  Never enough lanes open and I hate their policy of reading the customer's last name out loud when they give you the receipt.  My last name is no one's business!  Please stop doing this!  Major privacy violation!\n\nOn a positive note, the organic produce section is quite good and the only reason I shop here.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	We really like this store, but the lack of checkers is really becoming an issue. This Sunday there were 14 people in line and one checker. It literally took 20 minutes in line. This is the case every time we go. Management is trying to save money on checkers, but they qill end up losing customers. It's to the point that we are thinking about changing stores.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Every time we go to this location they're slow. Ordered two sandwiches from the to go sandwich counter. Only customer in line and it took the kid over 20 minutes. We went to check out in the express 15 item or less line and it took about 15 or 20 minutes for him to check out 3 people with credit cards and cash ready. I watched people leave my line, go into the regular lines and still beat me out the store. The clerk obviously did not care it was written all over his face. Went another time and just had to get something from the customer service counter and waited 7 to 10 minutes before I asked if anyone was working the counter and they finally sent someone my way about another 5 minutes later. Again people behind left in anger about the wait. Great store but the slowest staff and it's every time we go.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I'm in town visiting family and was doing some research to find some cute little cool spots to grab some snacks from. Let me tell you, I'm so glad I came across this place!\n\nI walked in and was blown away at the selection they offer. Everything from buns and pastries, to bubble tea and rice dishes. They have something for everyone! \n\nI came in and grabbed a few BBQ pork buns, a taro pastry, a red bean bun, and a beef curry pastry. So far I've inly tried the BBQ pork bun and beef curry pastry. Both are excellent and have a lot of filling! The beef curry pastry reminded me of a Jamaican beef patty. Really good stuff! I also got a Thai tea with boba. I thought it would be authentic but all of that stuff is just powdered. It's still good though. Give it a try! I walked out with 5 buns and a Thai tea for $11 and I'm stuffed.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	A sophisticated asian bakery with homemade pastries that have an artistic touch. I had a strawberry filled bread roll and it was good. The bread was fresh and the filling was real but it did not exceed my expectations. I also had the mango bubble tea and I was disappointed! The tea balls were gooey and the taste was just off. However, I like this place for a quick treat that is also pretty to look at!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	The only Chinese bakery in Cleveland and it is pretty good.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I have to say that because koko bakery doesn't have any competitors, it's hard to really compare their goods to others. CLE, I hope you step up your game because we need more Asian bakeries here!\n\nWith that said, I am grateful that we even have one bakery to get goodies from. Their breads are not bad, and it's better if you come in the morning when they are freshly baked. I usually get the beef curry bread, and the BBQ pork bread. These are kept in the smaller display case to left. \nThe other breads are also good, so don't feel shy about giving everything a try. Also, they have the best boba I've tried thus far in CLE. If only we had more to choose from...sigh. The prices are higher than what I'm used to seeing in Asian bakeries, but it's worth the $ to fulfill your cravings!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	As all my fellow yelpers know,\nI was craving a pork bun like WHOA!\nI got lots of recommendations from ya,\nLike Park to Shop, Bo Loong, and Li Wah.\nBut then along came the description of Koko,\nAnd I knew that's where I'd go.\nKinda nearby, on 37th and Payne,\nTook the Focus and Yelpette there in the rain. (Er, snow.)\n\nOnly had Bubble Tea once before,\nThought I'd try it again--it's what Koko's known for.\nTapioca pearls, chewy, creepy and round,\nWith a Thai tea flavor--it was pretty sound.\nGot two BBQ pork buns like I'd come in for,\nGot 'em wrapped to go and was out the door.\nService was friendly, people were nice,\nThe showcases stocked full of sweets to entice.\nI'll return someday soon, that much is true,\nAnd thank you Koko for my 300th review!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Pros\n- large buns\n- generous filling in the buns\n- great price!\n- great flavor\n- friendly service\n- good variety \n\ncons\n- they should be served warm, but we took them home to warm them up and they tasted great
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This is my go-to place after I've had lunch at one of the many Asian restaurants in the area.   I  usually stop on Friday, in order to stock up on goodies for the weekend.   There are a variety of stuffed buns (still working my way thru each type...lol!), all displayed and labeled nicely.  There are also a small selection of stuffed buns and turnovers, held in a warmer directly next to the display case.  Everything is fresh, colorful.  There is a bakery case with sweets next to the register, brownies, tarts, mousse, cakes, pastries etc.   In addition there are items packaged "to-go" on shelves around the bakery.  My favorite items are the almond shortbread cookies (toasted almonds in a fresh shortbread cookie...yum) and the dinner rolls....kinda reminds you of Hawaiian rolls, only better!  There is also a small foods menu with salads, rice bowls etc., which I haven't had the opportunity to try yet.  I love this place and looking forward to continually sampling all that it has to offer!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I have had better manapua (pork buns) in Honolulu, better rice bowls at Tensuke in Columbus, and I have had worse cakes in DC and worse service in LA. However, Koko has things in its favor that far exceed Asian bakeries in LA, DC, NYC and any other city that uses initials. First, the owner is a gem. She is friendly, generous, funny and knows how to cook and bake. \n\nSecond, you can find everything here. No need to run to a bakery, then a tea house, then a cafe, then a restaurant. Koko has all of this along with bubble teas. Being of a generation where bubble tea is as attractive as Kool-Aid I can make no recommendations. I can recommend the strawberry cake, the rice bowls and wide selection of buns and bakery. You would have to be a very hard to please person to not find things you like and I mean like a lot. \n\nI cannot be close to Koko's and not run in. Friends know a typical lunch at my house is a big bowl of home made ramen and pork buns from Koko Bakery. A frequent desert is a slice of a Koko strawberry cream cake. \n\nThank goodness Koko is in Cleveland as it saves me a lot of traveling when I crave a manapua.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	So, I'm mad at my mom because she's been going here for forever and I haven't even heard about this place until today...Like, "I'm so mad at you, Mom, because I feel like you've kept this wonderful place a secret and even more peeved that you've never brought home any goodies for me." \n\nBut, I instantly forgave her because 1. We came here and she showed it to me eventually and 2. Delicious enough treats never last car rides long enough. \n\nFricking: boba teas, lattes, savory and sweet filled buns, desserts, etc. So many goodies, so little time. Come here early when everything is stocked to the brim and made fresh. A great after dinner spot, quick breakfast, or a place to gab with someone for a while.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Koko's is a favorite stop of mine when in Asian Town of Cleveland. Their delicate flavored buns and donuts are wonderful. We'll generally buy a smattering of a little of this and a little of that--frankly we are quite fortunate to have such a high quality Asian Bakery in our midst. Just one more fabulous place in Cleveland! My favorite is their cocoa red bean filled bun. You'd never know the subtly sweet ingredients inside was a bean paste--a red bean paste, I think, which means, they're not bad for you, too! :-)
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I thought I walked into a bakery in the San Gabriel valley.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	The coconut pie, Curried beef donuts were awesome. However the bubble tea I did not care for at all. I got the lychee bubble tea but it was brown and tasted anything but like lychee. The bubbles were good but only got like a tablespoon of them in the glass. And almost half the glass was ice... so not impressed with the bubble tea. I don't think they used a lychee concentrate to make the tea.. they are using canned juice, which doesn't taste good at all. \nI'm only giving it 4 stars because the rest of the bakery stuff was good.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Koko is adorable. I've been here a couple times and the food is delicious. If you have time to wait, try any of the teryaki bowls or sandwiches. I really liked the pork bun. It takes awhile for them to make it, but the wait is worth it. If you don't have time to wait, get a selection of buns and they'll heat them up for you. For two bucks you can get a pack of three refrigerated steam buns to take home, they're pretty much a meal themselves. I can honestly say koko has (what I believe to be) the best looking pastry case in the midwest. Its beautiful. I tried the cassata cake and it was awesome. They're definitely a favorite of mine.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Such an awesome little place! Good for studying or just having a refreshment and hanging out! The pastries are priced amazing and tasty! My friends and I tried this place out and they have tons of flavors of bubble teas! We got the passion fruit (tangy like a lemonade), honeydew (sweet light honeydew flavor and refreshing) and the taro (like a Cap'n Crunch cereal flavor is the best way I can describe it) all of them were amazing!!! And we each got a pastry for $1.50!! Definately will be the spot this summer and we will be stopping in more often!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Awesome prices and even better baked goods!  Be sure to get there early because they get really busy at lunch time and I see that they sell out of some stuff.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Koko Bakery is not only a great place to eat for lunch near downtown, but it's also a lovely place to bring a date.  Watch your lady's eyes glow with the delicious pastries in the glass cases.  She will be so overwhelmed with all the beautiful looking food that it will take her forever to figure out what she wants. \n\nAlways been a home run place for me. \n\nThere is a couple things I could complain about, and it's not too much of a big deal but... it sure takes them an awfully long time to make anything that isn't already available to you. \n\nI've waited close to a half hour before for a teriyaki rice bowl before.  Same goes with their sandwiches. It's hard to make Koko Bakery a downtown lunch spot sometimes if you only get a half hour lunch break. \n\nOh, and I've ordered a parfait for a lady friend one time, and it was spoiled. Needless to say, the date was too after that. \n\nOther than that, the bubble tea and pastries keep me coming back.  The fried egg and turkey is so good I can eat two of them with no problem and even finish a pan of bread rolls.  It's sooo good.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Nice little place. Got a few meat filled buns and 2 bubble teas. The bread and filling was really good the bubble to was just ok I'm used to the ones served from Superior pho. I like the milkshake kind more then the liquid kind. I did find the machine they use at koko to seal the bubble tea cups kind of kool. Three stars because Of the bubble tea I would really only come here for the bread but I would never make a special trip out just for koko bakery.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Dozens of types of buns that are filled with sweet or savory fillings, all for under $2. Couldn't choose one so picked out 4! Many other options from rice bowls and salads to bubble tea, tarts and lattes. Excited to go back and try more. Service was slow (which is why I didn't give it 5) though but very nice so I didn't care very much.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	What I don't know: Much about Chinese bakeries or their offerings.\n\nWhat I do know:  when something tastes really good to me, when the service is fantastic, when the quality of the food justifies the price, when the atmosphere is really nice.\n\nSo in my novice's opinion, Koko completely and utterly rocks!\n\nTHE FOOD:  I picked something I knew I would like (iced Thai coffee), something I thought I would like (a ham and egg bun) and something that was completely new to me (a Chinese doughnut).  The food was very fresh and tasty.  The dough of the Chinese doughnut was firm and substantial, yet still tender and not overly sweet.  The paste was subtlely sweet and flavorful.\n\nThe ham and egg bun was an awesome take on a ham sammich-- really good quality ham and a fried egg on a slightly sweet, soft bread bun.  Mmmmmmm.\n\nThe owner gave me some cake to try-- dark with dried fruits.  Add some rum to that and you have my new favorite snack.  She also let me try the light cheese cake-- which is unlike any cheese cake I've tried.  It is more like a very moist cake.  I'm having that next time!\n\nTHE SERVICE:  The owner is really, really nice and the service is really, really helpful and friendly.  All the items are clearly labeled in English and Chinese.  If you have any questions, the staff will help!\n\nTHE ATMOSPHERE:  Very clean, bright, cheery, modern and pleasant.  Very much a cafe as well as a bakery.  They even offer sandwiches, smoothies and rice bowls!\n\nTHE PRICE:  A delicious, filling lunch rang in at under $5.  Super!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Best (well almost only truly authentic) bubble tea in town! The owner is friendly and I remember when this place first opened, how she was always there busting her chops, crafting sweets and stirring up a mean cup of bubble tea. I'm really happy to see how well the place has done over the years, having been able to hire several new, now regular employees. \n\nThai ice tea with milk & boba = awesome.\n\nTheir boba is rather unique, perfectly chewy, & almost has a hint of sweet carmel aftertaste.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Super cute little gem I found thanks to fellow yelpers!  I envision Hello Kitty and the Sanrio gang working here.\n\n\n  Impressive selection of treats and tea. Bubble tea, smoothies and hot Hong Kong tea.  I took one readers advice on the Hong Kong tea and I am an instant fan. Hong Kong-style milk tea, often known as dai pai dong milk tea, is a beverage originating from Hong Kong. It consists of black tea with evaporated milk (not condensed milk), and is usually part of an afternoon meal in Hong Kong tea culture.\n\n  Even close to closing the display cases still had tons of little beautiful pastries left to choose from.   \n\n  Staff was hard at work and very pleasant.  I look forward to sampling more at Koko's
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This place has two of my favorites under one roof: buns and bubble tea. Both were delicious. \n\nI had a green onion bun, which was fresh, fluffy, and savory. My thai bubble tea had the softest, chewiest bubbles I've probably ever had. It was a bit on the sweet side, but I like that. \n\nAround 5 P.M., the bun case was about 75% empty. Not sure if they bake only in the morning or throughout the day, but next time I'll be back much earlier to try more (as well as one of the various artful desserts in the case).
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	best chinese pastries ever! They are under $1.50 and fresh as can be, bubble tea is amazing! $4.50 for a large
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I go to Koko every time I'm in Cleveland. They have awesome bao and other pastries. The desserts are gorgeous. I have not tried one yet, but they are all like beautiful little works of art. They have a great selection of bubble tea as well. I try to stock up on the bao & sticky rice since I usually only make it to Cleveland once a month. Last time they didn't have the sticky rice ready, do they made me a special order. It's probably a good thing they aren't located closer to me or I'd be in there all the time!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	My favorite pastry shop in all of Cleveland. The smell of freshly baked bread that hits you as soon as you enter is an instant flashback to my childhood.  The mousse, cheesecake and the breads are the best.  I love the raspberry bread and the triple chocolate mousse, if I could I would be there everyday :)
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Koko Bakery is the definitive Chinese/Taiwanese bakery in Cleveland. Their buns and baked goods are consistently well made and they remind me of the bakery shops back home in Queens, NY. And if you need a bubble tea fix, well, they make some damn good bubble tea, too. Unfortunately, Koko is one place I will not be returning to and although I've been a longtime patron of its business, our customer-business relationship effectively ends today. Although the food here is solid, I think it's fair that other customers should be aware of the kind of service they might get at this place, so here's my story:\n\nI got a day off today from work. I don't get many days off, so I thought I'd treat myself with a bubble tea before my haircut appointment. At around 2:00pm I walk into Koko Bakery, order my bubble tea, and hand a $20 bill. The lady at the cashier (also the owner) handed me change for a $5 bill. During this time, she's chattering away with what must be one of her regular customers. I inquire about the rest of my change and she refuses to believe that I gave her a twenty, despite her admitting that she hadn't been totally attentive because she was talking to her other customers. She tells me that she would "call someone" to review the security tapes; asks me to leave my name, phone number, and zip code; and informs me that it would take a few minutes to get everything taken care of.\n\nI take my seat and sip on a bubble tea thinking that it wouldn't be too unreasonable for me to wait a bit to sort out an honest mistake. Ten minutes pass, nothing happens. The owner seems to have her hands tied so I figure I'll wait a bit longer. Twenty minutes pass. Still no word on when I'm getting the rest of my change. At the thirty minute mark (2:30pm on the clock--haircut appointment at 2:45) I walk up to the counter and ask her for my change, telling her I shouldn't have to wait half an hour to get my change. She's nice enough to admit that she made a mistake for not paying close enough attention to what I handed her, but her tone changes when I press her further. When I question her mode of customer service and threaten to take my business elsewhere, she gives me a good idea of how she runs shop by:\n\n1. Informing me that there are "rules" at her bakery and that she absolutely must review the videotapes before she can return my change\n2. Telling me that "when you're at my age running this business you'll know what it's like" (to have to mistrust customers?)\n3. Mentioning that $15, the amount of consideration in question, is serious money and she can't just give it away (which, barring the fact that it's my money, still does not excuse her from her tactless service)\n4. Telling me more than once that she's fine with me never coming back, which leads me to believe that her success (and Koko is a successful small business) to get to her head.\n\nThis exchange becomes rather heated until she gets a phone call from what I presume to be the person reviewing the tapes. I overhear her on the phone describing me with disdain in her voice as if she were trying to describe a petty criminal.\n\nForty minutes into the ordeal she receives another phone call confirming that I had indeed handed her a twenty, at which point she promptly hands back my change and in addition offers to refund my money for my bubble tea along with a free refill, which I politely refuse. It is fine that she apologized for her initial error and I accept her apology for her mistake, but her condescending attitude and unreasonable level of mistrust is enough to steer me clear of Koko Bakery and I would advise others to do the same.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Lots of different Taiwanese style pastries and drinks. Costs 25-50 cents more than the bakery items at the Park & Shop supermarket but looks MUCH nicer. Taste-wise is decent and good portioned. Their drinks are made from powder (like all the other places in Cleveland) but are mixed well. I like that they have different flavored loaf breads, like taro or green onion. They also serve rice bowls and simple noodles. They have 4 different kinds of zhongzi (sticky rice wrapped made in leaf), smaller & more pricey than those at the supermarket but I'm hoping they taste better (haven't tried the supermarket version yet). \n\nThe lady behind the counter was friendly and remembered us when we returned 2 days later. Way to make me feel like a regular already!  Looking forward to going back often.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Love the variety of Breads, sweets and bubble teas!  I also love the fact that they're open late!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	The staff is extremely rude and sometimes almost confrontational. It's almost as if you have to beg them to buy food from them. The place is also quite overpriced. It's one of the few places with asian baked goods, but if you are just looking for quality baked goods, Presti's at Little Italy offers higher quality food for cheaper and their service is not rude. \n\nI just can't get over how much I dislike the women that work here.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	The quality to hype ratio is less than one.\n\nBut that is not why it only earns an "A-OK" from me. Perhaps it's because I spent a good portion of my childhood in Flushing NY, where bakeries very much like this exist on virtually every block near Main St, but everything Koko Bakery sells is just mediocre at best. The baked goods (referring to all the sweet breads on the left when you enter) here are fine.. about as good (or not) as the average bakery in Flushing. Their prices are fair, and the lady that runs this place is awesome. She is full of energy and on occasion offers us free samples and recommendations.\n\nHere's what irks me: \nAside from baked goods, this place is known for their bubble tea. I have many friends who swarm to this place to inject themselves with the sweet stuff, then feel disgusting and sick after downing the $5 drink. And that's what annoys me.. EVERYTHING IS POWDER!! Green tea, taro, almond, even the original black tea! \nYou can see a cabinet of the multi-colored powder-mix they use for all their teas behind the counter. \nPowder usually costs approximately 25 cents per serving and tapioca costs approximately 10 cents a serving. Even with the cost of the cup and straw, you are still looking at drink under 50 cents! \nIf you are going to use powder for all your drinks, don't charge a premium price for it!\n\nA good bubble tea (reference: Ten Ren Tea & Ginseng in Flushing) BREWS their own tea, mixes in a shot of syrup, adds milk (or condensed milk), then shakes it with ice. What you get is the perfect balance of quality black tea and milk, just the right amount of sweetness, and a satisfying tapioca chew. With all the added effort, and quality, Ten Ren still charges less than Koko's.\n\nKoko benefits from the lack of bakeries like itself in the area, and thus competition is not an issue, and the need to improve is not imminent. I understand when certain drinks need to be made from powder, but it is a real downer when even the tea flavors are. We (asians) are good at tea! And we should be applying our specialty into making awesome bubble tea! No more of that water and powder tea please\n\nFood: B-\nAtmosphere: B\nService: A
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	They serve the best bubble  tea in town.  If you are new to the bubble tea world....start with Taro.  I also highly recommend their green tea jasmine flavor.  In addition to tea there is a plethora of pastries to try.  Great spot in Chinatown/Midtown.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	A friend brought me here when I came to visit because she was craving some boba and pastries.  I feel like this place is the only place in the Cleveland area that serves decent Taiwanese pastries and drinks.  Probably not many to chose from, but when I compare this place to places on the west coast, Koko is an acceptable place to fill my cravings.  There wasn't anything special here except the fact that they survive in such a small Chinatown environment.  I hope this place stays open forever because there aren't many(any?) other options out there.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I give this place five starts due to its mere existence in Cleveland. This was a stop on my touristy first trip to AsiaTown and I had a great time. It offers Asian pastries, breads, some more standard tarts, bubble tea, etc, so what's not to love? I'll be sure to come back here soon for more doughy custard stuff pastries soon.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Was searching all over town to satisfy a breakfast craving. Found this gem of a place from fellow yelpers. I'm from out of town and the area  looked a little sketchy but wow. Buntastic!! What a diamond in the rough. I had the corn/ham & ham/cheese bun. Might have to come back for lunch and get the pulled pork bun.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I absolutely love this place. I've been here 3 or 4 times since I discovered it, and I have to say I'm definitely in love. The bubble tea is decently priced (coming from other areas with delicious but crazy overpriced bubble tea) and delicious. I have yet to try the food there, but the fresh-made bread is so good! Very authentic. You can get all the sweets, cakes, and pastries you can think of here, too. I can't wait to try all of this stuff...if I could I'd come here every day. The service and people are very nice. They are willing to explain things to you if you don't know what it is or if you're unsure of what to get. And it is by far the cleanest Chinese/Asian bakery place I've been to recently. If I had to complain about something, it's the hours. It closes at 7, which is usually too early for my bubble tea craving to set in, and they only take credit card charges if you buy more than $5, but that's typical of smaller businesses. In short, GO! You won't regret it!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	The Hong Kong milk tea is great: rich, sweet, and a little floral. I took home some pork buns from the same cooler and steamed them at home, so much flavor. Next time I'm going to try the BBQ pork buns. \n\nI love Koko!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	WoW!  I've found excellent bubble tea in Cleveland!  I developed a love for bubble (AKA as Boba) tea in college.  For those of you who don't know what it is, it's tea with little balls of black tapioca on the bottom.  The tea is sweet and comes in many different flavors (examples, are mango and guava).  You sip it down and then you suck up the bubbles and chew them. Yum Yum Yum!  \n\nNot only does Koko bakery have that, both in hot and cold varieties, it also has a wide array of Asian pastries.  My husband's favorites are the steamed buns, that come stuffed with red taro, for example.  And in addition, they also have your usual European style pastries, including rather excellent brownies.  And they make cakes to order!  I saw some already made ones which looked beautiful. \n\nWe've already been back and we look forward to ordering cakes for birthdays here!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I'm very big on boba tea. Back home in Atlanta, I'd go get a drink almost every other day. I recently moved to Cleveland, and there isn't much places that has boba tea here. I was recommended by my aunt here, so I stopped in one day. I had a strawberry milk tea, and it didn't impress me very much. I could taste the powder- it wasn't mixed well enough, and bubbles were a little hard. I give places the benefits of the doubts and told myself maybe it was just too busy and they rushed a little. Eventually I came back because I wanted to give it another chance. This time I asked if they had honey green tea. The nice lady that took my order told me yes. It made me so happy because that's what I'd usually order at a boba tea place. (It wasn't on the menu.) \nWhile another lady made my drink, I was anticipating and hoping it'll be good. After I got my drink, I took a sip, and it was actually very good. Bubbles were good too.. Good thing they had a positive turn over for me. I'll be back.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	A small Asian bakery in Cleveland with great taste. I got a pork steam bun and the Thai Iced bubble tea. Very good!  Would like try some desserts from here on the future. Mmm...
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I think I've died and went to Chinese Bakery Heaven !\n\nJust happened upon this place by chance ... tried the coconut almond bun (delicious and gone in about 30 seconds),  steamed pork bun (incredible and around 1$), a lotus moon cake (so-so).   Will have to try the bubble tea next.\n\nKoko, until we meet again ....
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Simple yet amazing little gem in Cleveland. Best teriaki chicken ever
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	"You know what would really turn this day around? A hot dog baked into a doughnut" - My inner dialogue, with alarming frequency. \n\nLove Koko Bakery for the above-mentioned treat, as well as the delicious coffee and bubble teas. Also, I bought one of the beautiful fruit cakes for a work birthday once, and it was a huge hit!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Buns, pastries, rice bowls or sandwiches - all amazing. The pork steam buns are my weakness. A great place to set up with a laptop and get work done, too.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Stopped in here to check out the place and seemed like an authentic Asian bakery. I had the coconut roll -- delicious bread pastry filled with a sugar, coconut mixture. I've heard the bubble tea is good too, so I'll probably be back in the near future.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	While we were saddened to find that our favorite place "Golden Bakery" had closed, we soon found koko as a more than suitable substitute for our asian baked goods cravings.\n\nKoko caters to a diverse crowd, serving a limited soup/sandwich lunch menu along with the assortment of hot and cold buns and tasty treats from the cake coolers. Their drink selection is extensive with everything from fresh soy milk to the best bubble tea in the chinatown area. The other kicker is prices stay cheap, so you can stuff yourself silly on baked goods for under $10.\n\nTheir pork bun recipe must have come directly from golden bakery, because they are equally delicious. The selection is diverse enough that you can make frequent trips and not get bored. They also carry a large selection of fresh fruit cake items, and take orders for whole cakes and bulk bakery items.\n\nAll in all the best asian bakery in chinatown.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Koko bakery was a pleasant surprise! I didn't expect to find a good bubble tea place here in Ohio, but Koko bakery was a little hidden gem for me.\n\nI ordered a large lychee bubble tea with low sugar. However, they gave me a small at first and had to remake it. Even after remaking it, it tasted a bit too sweet,  and the lychee taste was a bit overpowered by the milk tea put into it. Don't get me wrong though - it was delicious,  and made the way bubble tea should be made - shaken and sealed. It just wasn't exactly what I expected. \n\nWe also got taiwanese shaved ice. The way they plated it was very well done.  They used fresh fruit,  and the sweetness of the condensed milk complemented the jelly/red bean very well.\n\nFor the price point, you certainly get a good bang for your buck. My only problem was there seemed to be miscommunication between the employees, and the service time is not as fast as it could be, particularly during busier hours. Would definitely come back if I'm back in the area.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I am really tempted to give KoKo Bakery a 5 star because I do appreciate Cleveland having a bubble tea & chinese bakery store (since there's no other).\n\nHowever, I feel like I need to be fair and say that I'm not a huge fan of their bubble tea and I'm not a huge fan of their pastries. Their bubble tea is pretty pricey (which makes sense since they're a monopoly in the area) & it's all pretty watered down. I've gotten bubble tea twice here and both times just so I can give my friends an idea of what bubble tea tastes like. Then their pastries.. i was so excited the first time I bought it that I went ahead and bought like 4 different kinds. Although it does taste good, their pastries aren't fresh enough. \n\nOverall, I really appreciate KoKo Bakery's existence and trying to get people to try bubble tea and the pastries. I also love the atmosphere in the store. And I do know that when I crave bubble tea, this is the place I'd be at. But, I've had better.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	They are located at a nice sunny corner. There are  around 36 seats so plenty of room for you to work/study or have a group gathering. They pork bun and sticky rice roll was excellent. Boba tea was pretty good too  Very decent for a $ place.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Decent bakery, especially because this is the only Asian bakery in town. They have a pretty big selection. However, if you're going for baked goods, I would wait about an hour after they open because that's when they stock the shelves. The boba is pretty good. I recommend the honeydew. There are plenty of tables to hang out with friends or get some studying done.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This is Chinese bakery/bubble tea heaven!!!  The bakery is cute and very clean inside.  They have a plethora of Chinese-style pastries to choose from along with different types of steamed buns, sponge roll cakes, more traditional Chinese pastries like lou po beng (or wife/sweetheart cakes, you know, the ones with the wintermelon inside!) and duck egg pastries...fruit cakes and more Western/European-style pastries.  They have freshly baked bread.  They have bubble tea with tons of flavors and different drink size options.  They make bubble tea how it should be, tea and milk.  The boba is always perfect in consistency.  \n\nThe last time I went here, I got a taro bun, almond milk tea with boba and some lou po beng to share with some friends.  I totally would have eaten more, but I was stuffed from lunch and the said items above were all I could fit in my belly.\n\nI grew up eating Chinese bakery items and this place is one of my favorites.  I just wish I lived closer to you, Koko Bakery.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I love koko! I came here for breakfast this morning. I was super hungry, and their buns really hit the spot!  They don't have only pork buns, but ask kinds of things - egg and ham, bacon and cheese, ham and cream cheese buns, chicken and mushroom buns... yum!  It was a great breakfast spot.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I too was sad to see Golden Bakery close. But Koko could prove to be a suitable, if not better, replacement.\n\nThe decor is super bright and cheery... and CLEAN. Something some of the china town joints lack. I was quite surprised when I walked in. Really nice.\n\nI opted for a rice flour bun thing. It was flaky on the outside and on the inside, some kind of glutenous rice filling. It was OK. I was gambling with this one. It was just too sweet for my taste. I also got a Thai Bubble/Boba Tea. Unfortunately, it was disappointing. The tapioca pearls were soggy and falling apart. Bad bubbles! Something I experience with about half the bubble teas I get from various places around town. Seems like a lot of places pre-make the pearls and they sit all day in water. The pearls cannot sit for long or they turn to mush. I also thought the tea itself was a bit too sweet. I usually make my own bubble tea at home. Pacific East has great bubble tea as well as Mint Cafe (it's frozen, but oh so good... especially on a hot summer day). The nice thing about Koko is that they have a pretty big selection of flavors. I will give them another chance with this.\n\nI didn't get to meet the infamous owner lady that everyone raves about. Instead, I got a hard-to-understand, emotionless teenager. Ah well, she's young...\n\nI got a coconut cream bun and an egg tart to go. It was nice because they individually heat seal each item in a plastic bag to keep everything fresh. Both were really good, pretty much the same as what the other bakery used to carry.\n\nEven though I got bad bubble tea, I won't hold it against them...yet. I will definitely give them another try. I would like to try their lunch offerings. The meat filled buns looked really good!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This is the only bakery and bubble tea cafe in Cleveland. I like the bubble tea as it is more authentic than the ones served in restaurants. They have green tea cakes, Korean and Thai shaved ice, fruit smoothies and bubble teas. My favorites are taro, red bean and lychee. If you ever had bubble tea, make it is pretty easy. However, in the wrong hands can taste pretty unsatisfying.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	It took my son and his friends to get us to Koko.  My hubby and I attempt to stay away from this area because we will spend and spend and eat and eat !!  Cleveland has so many different wonderful places with flavors from all over the world !  \n  I am a bubble tea lover, I enjoyed the honeydew.  We purchased several buns, really liked all of them the dough was perfect tender, light.  The best lunch bun was the BBQ Pork, should have bought a dozen..but that would have really blown any calories for the day !!\n  I like the place, self serve, counter order and pay.  Can't wait to try the other items rice bowls, other meals and sandwiches.  Even shaved ice.  \n  The other pastries, mousse's, cakes, etc. were all decorated with a talented hand.  Almost to pretty to eat.  We will surely return to taste more.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Huge array of baked goods including various (very cheap!) buns, pastries (grossly overpriced) and mousses/parfaits. And of course the bubble tea, and a bunch of other beverages/teas.\n\nThey make all of their bubble tea with powder, which I knew going in and could definitely taste in my mango tea but it was still great nontheless. Not the best boba I've ever had in the Cleveland area but not the worst either. Open Christmas Eve and Christmas Day which is awesome.\n\nWhen I was there I had a red bean paste bun ($1.10?) along with my bubble tea and my boyfriend had the Chocolate Lover cake, which cost almost $7 for a thin slice. It was delicious though, dense and might've had some mousse baked into it?\nI honestly can't blame them for hiking up the prices on things as they have pretty much no competition to speak of.\n\nIf you're not used to Chinese sweets it's probably good to note that everything can be expected to be a lot less sweet than their American counterparts (which is a good thing IMO).\n\nThey serve lunch until 4pm, haven't had an opportunity to try that yet.\n\n-1 star for the crazy prices on everything besides the buns.\n\n\nI look forward to going back and trying lunch as well as a lot of their other baked stuff! :)\n\n\noh yea in somebody elses review they say the credit/debit minimum is $10. I don't know if it changed recently or something, but it was $5 when I went.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This place is awesome, if only Cleveland could see it. It pains me to see how slow this bakery gets, esp during the winters....although I only come here on the weekends, so hopefully I'm wrong. \nThey have the most variations of baked buns, shakes, and pasteries...different desserts.  They don't stay open very late, given the neighborhood it's in... So if you plan on heading there after dinner for dessert, its most likely closed.\n\nThe prime reason I come-- tawianese shaved ice with condense milk and fresh fruits. It's missing the ice-cream, but I enjoy it anyways. Kinda pricey, but it's Cleveland.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Taiwanese shaved ice, pot bing su, bubble tea, AND a chinese bakery all in one... in the midwest?!!?!!? I fell in love right when I first came to Cleveland. Going to koko felt like stepping into Taiwan.. or a major American city.. for a few minutes.\n\nComments:\n- When I got the Taiwanese shaved ice two years ago, it was huge. Very refreshing. I do like some of the bakery items. I usually get a loaf of taro bread whenever I go. \n\n- The lao ban (owner/boss) is pretty fun too. She's a great people-person.\n\n- It's quite pricey, but what can you do? \n\n- I think they should open up a store on campus at Case Western. They would make a killing there.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Always recommended ! I'm a Chinese student from Athens Ohio, not very far but not near at all.  My friend took me there the first time with her family, and it's my first destination every time to Cleveland.    The owner s always nice and helpful.  Real good cakes and deserts.  Hope we have one like this in Athens, that would be awesome.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Was downtown early this past Saturday and could not find a parking spot to eat breakfast.  I knew there were places around 40th street, so my son and I decided to be adventurous.  Thanks to Yelp we found Koko's.  I have spent a lot of time in San Francisco and coming in to this clean, bright shop I could have easily been in SF's Chinatown.  Great selection of yummy savory or sweet baked items, bread and dessert.  I love that the 10 or so tables seemed to just be the right size for the number of people, not too crowded and not empty.  The ham and egg pastry was delicious and at $2.00 was worth it.  The almond cream pastry was light, sweet no delicious.\n\nMy only suggestions: it was hard to understand the workers when I asked them a question as their English was not very good.  And it would be nice to have a couple bread or pastry samples so we could try them.  If I could've tried the taro bread, I may have bought it, but at $5.50 for a small loaf, didn't want to take the chance.\n\nNonetheless, my son and I tried a variety of items and all were very good with unique combinations (pineapple smoothly was sweet, refreshing, and delicious) and we will definitely return.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Great overlooked treasure in this downtown Cleveland neighborhood.  Stop by and get a bubble tea and some desserts you'll be happy you did.  Great desserts, clean store and friendly staff.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I really liked the bread and the egg dessert thing from the bakery, but my brother did not like the boba tea, so I cannot really give it 5 stars.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Very fresh bakery and delicious! Kind of wish I could read what exactly is on the bun before I get it so I know what I'm eating.... the peanut butter bun was good but the filling was an interesting mix of peanut butter and something else... smoothies were yummy... got fresh mangos and strawberries for my smoothie selection...
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	this place is unbelievable -- probably the best cream buns in town\n\nthe sweets and cakes are incredible looking -- they look like works of art -- not for eating\n\nmy friend bob, who runs tea house noodles (east sixth street), says their...egg-and-sausage...cooked-in-a-bun are out of this world -- i don't eat meat --jessica said she can make it for me, with two eggs -- next time -- trouble is, whenever i go there, i'm doing my 'friday rounds,' which include going to tea house noodles for their freakin' rican special...or...to my lunch meeting at siam cafe -- and, i've been going to ko ko...for the buns -- take 'em home\n\noh, well\n\ni forgot -- plus, their buns...are...a great deal -- something like...a buck-ten a piece\n\nthe sponge cakes/bread...are great\n\nand i still haven't tried the bubble tea -- which i love\n\ni put my pictures -- plus...some from here -- on my blog, anna moffo and other loves\n\nhttp://annamoffoandotherloves.blogspot.com/2013/03/look-what-jessica-can-do.html
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	If there are any bad reviews, then they have limited themselves. This is the only cute little asian bakery around the area. Asia town itself is quite unimpressive and severely limiting. As a CWRU student there are hardly any Asian restaurants close by to start out with and this little bakery is cheap and delicious. \n\nIt takes about 25 mins to get to Koko's by RTA and may 10-15 minutes by car. I wish we had closer asian restaurants and such. \n\nI love their bread selection, they is always a wide variety and they always seem fresh. Their bubble tea is good, better than the ones I've had in Coventry. Their sweets also look adorable, so it's fun eating those.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	i stop in here when im in town as the hours are convenient.  they are average in bubble tea, the bobas can be a bit chewier, the tea is decent.  the pastries are also average. you can find fresher items at other local cleveland asian pastries.  there is free wifi and about a dozen tables.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	The food: The bread will stick to your teeth when you bit or chew, the worst Asian bakery I've ever had.\nThe staff: I may not be the only one believe that the owner should go see a psychiatrist.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	THIS IS THE BEST BUBBLE TEA IN ALL OF OHIO!\n\n... But that's not saying much.  If I am absolutely desperate for this quintessential Asian drink, Koko is what I'd settle for in this city.  The tapioca has the correct texture, most of the time.  The tea is way too sweet and I cannot bear to drink any flavors but almond.  But, it is still the best Cleveland's got.  The prices are reasonable if you are from the east coast, and frickin expensive if you are from California.   Sometimes, I just wish that Cleveland would get a Lollicup or a Ren Ten or something (believe me, I've been hinting this to the owner of the Asian Town Center for months).\n\nThe place also has Asian pastries, which are decently made and fresh enough.  Though... I have gotten extremely fresh, still-warm Asian pastries in the supermarket of the Asian Town Center.\n\nKoko also has wifi so it is a nice place to study, if you are looking for a place to chillax in Asia Town.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I used to work around the corner from this place. The one and only thing I miss from that job is that it was around the corner from this place!\n\nThe tofu teriyaki rice bowl was my all time. \n\nVery, very friendly and clean. And for some reason my lunch hour seemed to last 2 hours here. I'm convinced that they have a time machine in the kitchen!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Visiting Cleveland for the weekend and a friend recommended we try this bakery.  \n\nBubble tea is really good.  Pearls were excellent and the flavor was not too sweet.\n\nChinese breads were ok.  The selection is pretty minimal and the bread wasn't nearly as soft as I am used to.  My favorite is the Bolo bread, which consists of this crumbly sweet layer on top of the bread.  There were only two of these breads left when I went, but both were missing chunks of the top layer.  The Almond bread was much better and the onion bread definitely isn't the traditional onion bread you usually see.\n\nLooked like they had a large selection of chinese pastries and cakes, but we didn't get a chance to try any of that or any of their savory dishes.  Next time we're in Cleveland, we'll probably stop by and try some other things, but probably not any of their breads.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This is a place that allows for lots of fun. There is a case of goodies, trays and tongs below. Grab a tray and experiment. Each piece is fairly priced so if you don't like it, little is lost.  Great drinks also.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Love this palce! They have the best hazelnut liquid iced coffee. The coconut almonds bun are delicious.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Based upon previous reviews, an entrepreneur with bubble tea passion should open up a place.  Bubble tea isn't my thing, so I didn't try it here.  I'm not expert enough to judge authenticity, but based upon appearance & taste, Koko has the goods.  Everything here we tried was very tasty.  I love pork filled steam buns and the BBQ pork bun was very good.  The curry beef bun also very nice.  The "western" pastries here also quite good.  Staff was eager to answer any questions.  37th and Payne may not be exacly "close" for a lot of people, but Koko Bakery is worth a detour.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	A great Taiwanese bakery near Downtown Cleveland. I stopped in to pick up some buns for my Taiwanese wife while I was in Cleveland on a business trip. They have a really good selection of buns, rice balls and desserts. They also have hot food which I wish I could have tried. Definitely checkout Koko Bakery for your Taiwanese fix.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Ever since my friends showed me this place a few years ago, I always try to make it a point to visit when I'm back in town. The baked goods you put on a tray and bring it to the checkout counter instead of saying everything that you want up-front. (If it's in a case by the register, you ask for it at the register though!)\n\nEverything here is fresh and I love it. I swung by for Easter Sunday and it was pretty busy but they handled the volume well. \n\nMy favorite? Egg tarts
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I still can't get over the fact that boba is called "bubble tea" here in the mid-west.\n\nAfter driving around for a while, my boyfriend and I stumbled upon this place in search of anything vaguely Asian.  Things are a bit on the expensive side -- 90c - $1.50 for baos, $1.10 for don tart.  We picked up a char siu bao, a milk custard bao, a don tart, and a starfruit "bubble tea."  The char siu bao filling tasted a bit of American barbeque sauce... perhaps they ran low on char siu.  The don tart was pretty good, with a nice flaky crust.  I haven't had a chance yet to try the custard bao.  The bubble tea was passable, although I probably won't order that particular flavour again.\n\nThis whole transition from Irvine could be difficult.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I usually get the mini desserts, tiramisu, cheese tarts. Nothing has disappointed me from this place. Very clean and nice ladies working. They have a few rice bowls too that are good. Nice little gem in asiatown area.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Please bear with me while I make this bold statement: Koko bakery is not an Asian bakery or Chinese bakery. It is a Taiwanese bakery. The owner is Taiwanese. The little pastry buns in the glass display case are your stereotypical Taiwanese flavors. The "quick meals" are typical Taiwanese meals you get from a food stall. The moon cakes, meat buns, veggie buns, mango shaved ice, all scream Taiwanese. Let's be clear about this, and perhaps you'll evaluate it from a different standard.\n\nThe pastry are what you can expect to get from an average bakery in Taiwan. Hot dog, dried pork, wedges of boiled egg in a bun - it's not sweet, it's not really pastry, (it's a hot dog bun, let's be real) but every pastry shop has it. Buns with green onions and pork jerky? Sounds quirky, but 100% Taiwanese. Those are all very local flavors. \n\nPrevious yelpers have commented on the quality of the tea - so I won't repeat here. Please see Michael C, NY's review on what makes a good cup of milk tea.\n\nI haven't seen a whole lot of comment on the sticky rice ball 飯糰 so I'll pitch in here. Today is my first time trying it at koko - what do you know, a pregnant lady craves food out of her norm. The fillings are all correct ingredients of a Taiwanese rice ball flavor - diced dry turnip, fried Chinese donut, and dried pork powder. But the rice is wrong. Way wrong. You should be able to taste each grain of rice yet at the same time each grain soft and sticky so the ball doesn't fall apart. \n\nSo you see the whole time I was consuming this rice ball I felt very conflicted. I kept chasing the flavor produced by the internal fillings, because it's the flavor ingrained in the memory; and kept rejecting the texture of the external "wall of mushy rice", because it's not what I associate with a rice ball. Before you know it, I finished this rice ball and I don't know whether to laugh or cry.\n\nThis is the only Taiwanese-owned eatery/bakery in Cleveland, and pretty darn authentic. I've heard rumor that's there's going to be a Taiwanese tea house but I haven't seen it materialized.\n\n-----update -----\nFellow yelper CH Y. let me know that the new teahouse is opened-\nVintage Tea and Coffee\n1816 E12th St\n\nI haven't had the pleasure to try it yet. Some day.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I frequent this bakery almost every time I am downtown. I usally get a "Hong Kong" tea (tea with sweetened milk) is one of my favorite. This bakery puts out great bakery items like creamy milk buns, steamed pork buns, taro steamed cake, radish cake and many more. \n\nThis is a great hangout place and to surf internet while sipping your favorite beverages. The owner is super nice and always make weekly special to entice the customers palate.\n\nWriting this review makes me hungry.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I think koko bakery has changed a little since last time I visited there - now it looked pretty darn clean and organized. All the pastries/asian cakes/desserts were very well decorated and looked very tempting. Their bubble tea also tasted pretty authentic as well - not watered down and the bubbles were not too soft or hard. I also like their bubble tea package - they've got some jokes/games on it. I like cracked up so hard after I read them. haha The waitresses were also really friendly. I got the mango mousse last time - it tasted ok. I don't know what but the flavor seemed a little lacking and artificial, but it was very reasonably priced. Other than that, I'd definitely go again to try some of their other desserts!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I like this place (and would give it 3.5 but Yelp doesn't do halves!).. but not love since it is pretty over priced compared to bakery goods you can get from Chicago, NYC, SF, etc. But I guess that's what you get for not having any competition in Cleveland. \n\nI like the turkey and egg sandwich; be sure to get them when they're fresh so that the yolk is nice, warm and runny. I also really really love their turnip cakes. Other things I have tried in the past... hot dog bun (pretty standard and good), fried doughnut with chicken (yummy but too greasy), pineapple bun with cream (unique - all the other bakeries I've been to in SF and Chicago, I haven't seen this combination! After eating this a couple of times though, I got kind of sick of the cream - too creamy for me). Things to avoid.. they have this weird sponge cake thingy near the register, and it's both sweet and savory - I think it has shredded pork and scallions embedded in a sponge cake - it's an odd combination to say the least. Also, the egg tarts are overpriced (I think it was around 1.25 for a regular egg tart), and just average, nothing to rave about. Nowadays, we have been stocking up on their steamed pork buns. Yummy, especially when dipped in rice vinegar! The only downside to ordering this is that they are extremely slow with getting the buns to you (even though.. despite what we thought originally, the owner told us that she just microwaves them for 30 seconds or so before serving them hot to us; we had thought they steamed them, and hence why they would take so long). We have waited for like 15-30 minutes sometimes to just get the prepackaged frozen steam buns as well. Maybe not the best place to go if you're in a big rush. \n\nI do enjoy the samples that they have out. Also, the owner is extremely nice, and sometimes will give you free cake or buns for no reason.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	they're the best asian bakery and bubble tea in town! which isn't hard to say since they are pretty much the only asian bakery and bubble tea shop in town...\nthey do a pretty good job with their tasty treats. my favorite bakery items are the custard cream bun and the taro bread. i also looooove their rice rolls - i get the vegetarian rice rolls, which have "you tiao" (chinese fried dough) and pickled vegetables wrapped up in sticky rice. probably sounds weird to americans but just try it - it's really tasty!\nas for drinks, i pretty much just stick with their hong kong tea. i do find it kind of strange that my drink size sometimes depends on what time of day it is or who is making it. normally i get the large and it's in a 16 oz cup but sometimes i'm given a large that's like 25 oz or something. it's weird. but it's always creamy and thick, never watered down. i usually have to go home and add more tea because i like mine less creamy.\noh i have also tried a couple of their vegetarian buns, one with mostly leeks i think, and another with mostly cabbage. tasty, but could use more filling to bun ratio. i also had their lunch entree curry tofu and vegetables. vegetables were fresh and curry was good but it tasted like they forgot to add salt. so i added salt and it was all good.\nso if you're in CLE, come here for some tasty treats, but don't expect it to be as good as nyc chinatown or anything. they are closed on tuesdays, which i always forget!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Not a lot of vegan options other than their tofu rice bowls and steam buns which are pretty good.  My non-vegan friend that go in there drool at the display cases and rave about the pastries.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Enjoy this place and it doesn't really have any competition in CLE, so I'm grateful that its here at all.  Friendly staff.  Cakes are pricey but the buns are tasty and cheap.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Tucked away in a tiny plaza with a tiny parking lot, Koko's is a small bakery with huge flavors. We originally came here for smoothies and bubble tea but were quickly engrossed with the bakery items. I opted for the almond coconut pastry, milk cream bun, taro bun, and fruit tart. Also we ordered a green apple smoothie, watermelon bubble tea, and kiwi smoothie with passion fruit jelly. It was extremely busy and the girls making the smoothies were working as fast as they could but it was still a wait. I didn't mind. There was a little mishap with our green apple smoothie. It tasted very strongly of dark roast coffee. My guess is the blender was not cleaned out enough between drink orders. We had them remake it and the smoothie tasted better. Other than that we were pretty satisfied. I'd come here again.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Freaking Great!   Generally, Chinese bakeries suck.  Normally, I would only go to Japanese or Korean bakeries.   But, this Chinese bakery is the bomb!!   \n\nIt probably is the best one I have been to anywhere in the world (China, NY, SF, etc.)\n\nThe pork bun is very fresh and home made. Amazing. The Taiwanese zongzi is great, sticky and yummy. The dry pork cake roll is super good, the cake is very soft, there is Mayonnaise inside. I will come back and try sweets next time. They look super cute and yummy. I love this place:)
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I am very picky about desserts and pastries, and even pickier about iced coffee.  KoKo bakery satisfies me.  Whether you are craving a savory snack, sweet boba milk tea, or a more filling option, KoKo Bakery has it covered.\nFirst, it's clean and bright...no odd smells, no trash on the floor.  This cleanliness even extends to the nice parking lot.  \nI have only had coffee drinks at this place in the past...they're excellent.  \nIt may be confusing at first to newcomers at how you get the tasty pastry or pork bun that you've been eyeing in the tall display case.  I was standing there, selecting a BBQ Pork Bun to take home when a customer approached and sheepishly asked me if we indeed served ourselves or do we place the order at the register?  I told him that I watched some others pick up a tray, place a sheet of parchment on it, then opened the display case and select the items they wanted, placing them carefully on the paper with the provided pair of tongs. So this is how I did it, too.\nAnyway, after selecting the pork buns (which have a TON of flavor and filling), I went to the register and ordered honeydew boba and strawberry boba milk teas, a brownie, and custard tart along with a BBQ pork bun and pork filled pastry.  All of the bakery was to-go...and the cashier was very sweet and put each piece of bakery in a little clear plastic bag and then sealed it!  This was really cool, because then it won't get stale before you can enjoy it.\nThere is a minimum amount of $5 if you are going to charge anything on a card.  So, keep this in mind.\nThe customer service was great, and with smiles and "thank-you"s.  \nI really like this place, and the quality is excellent!  The best Asian bobo milk tea and bakery in the area.  The boba milk tea is light, fruity and sweet, and the tapioca balls are large, soft, and chewy.  There's a lot of fruit flavor...and it doesn't taste artificial (it may be!). They also have phenomenal iced coffee, Vietnamese-style.\nAnother thing: they are closed every Tuesday!!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	-Friendly service.\n-Hot and cold bubble teas with extensive menu\n-Sometimes the bubble tea is way too sweet for me though, even if you ask them to make it less sugary.\n-Lots of pastries, buns, and snacks to choose from\n-The cakes on the front table look very appetizing, but sometimes they look better than they actually taste\n-Credit card accepted for purchases over $5\n-They do a good job for Cleveland, but if this bakery and bubble tea place were in some place like San Francisco (or even Arizona) I probably wouldn't go here for my bubble tea fix.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Went to this place when they were at Their old spot and it was good.... Been to this new spot and I will say it's comparable to how I've seen the Asian bakeries these days if not better... Definitely deserved 5 stars because they stepped their game up.... I just try new pastries every time I go and enjoy.....
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Great pastries! The owner gave me some to sample too ; ) Great lunch spot.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I just love Koko Bakery, especially their Boba, er,  Bubble Tea; definitely the best selection of Bubble Tea I've seen in Cleveland.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Pretty good stuff, but very overpriced.  Stick with what they prepare. The apple squares that sell for $2 everywhere else are $4, rubbery and barely thawed.\n\nThey seem to pay attention to cleanliness - and they never touch your food.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I was severely disappointed with Koko Bakery and will never go back.\n\nI ordered a vanilla latte off their list of several espresso drinks. The staff grabbed a cold cub and scooped powder into it, I repeated that I wanted a hot latte.  She grabbed a hot cup and poured drip coffee from a dispenser.  I asked her if the latte will have espresso in it.  She had someone else show her how to use the espresso machine, and put normal coffee grounds into it, then made a Pyrex pitcher full of coffee from the machine, that she poured into my cup.  She then asked me if I want cream in my coffee.  I told her that a latte is made with shots of espresso and steamed milk. She poured cold milk into it and handed me the drink.\n\nI took a sip, it was definitely not a latte.  I asked them to make me the correct drink or refund me the money.  She refused to refund the money because I took a sip and said that she made me the drink.  I instructed them to take lattes off the menu if they don't know how to make espresso drinks, and had my money refunded promptly by my credit card company. \n\nHorrible customer service and completely unacceptable attitude towards their customers.  A perfect example of how businesses should NOT treat their customers.  Stay away.\n\n-----------------------------------\nExplanation of my rating system -\n5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back\n4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category\n3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.\n2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.\n1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	The bubble tea is pretty good. I really liked the cute cartoons on the cup. It is a strange drink. I have tried a lot of the different sweets here and enjoyed them all. The fruit parfait is one of my favorites. It is almost a solid pint of fresh fruit (mango, kiwi, strawberry and others) for around $3. The baked goods are great. I was full after eating a meal next door at Map of Thailand and could not resist coming in here for a desert. The service is excellent and I always enjoy the international music playing. One of my favorite bakeries.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This business is amazing.. yes they are a bit pricey.. but after being there a few times and getting to know the staff they really have a passion for these baked goods and make things very fresh. They have the biggest chocolate covered strawberries I have seen by far.. They dial back the sweetness too as to a lot of asian bakeries do, and I mentioned something about it and how impressed I was that is was just a wonderful blend of flavor and not too crazy sweet and the owner was very thankful and super sweet. I have had nothing but great service there, even had the owner cater to us and clean up after us herself which she did not have to do we would have done it ourselves. They have board games there and just a wonderful atmosphere.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	With all the bad reviews on customer service, I was ready to have my head bitten off as a small offering for some Asian pastries.\n\nInstead, I was happily surprised to be helped by a young, quiet and cheerful girl. I selected my breads from the cabinet and she sealed them all individually. I ordered an iced Vietnamese coffee with boba. The boba itself is delicious, but as other reviewers have pointed out, it's a powdered drink. I was a little disappointed in not having a legitimate Vietnamese coffee. But it was drinkable, and I enjoyed the baked breads I got. The chocolate bread had a filling with a strange consistency--I ate all the bread and pulled out the filling. The cream bun was moist and soft, filled with a sweet cream that was superb. \n\nThey offer sweet and savory breads, and lunch items, like teriyaki and katsu. They also have an assortment of cakes and cookies. I'd return for more of the breads and maybe tea or a smoothie instead!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	After a long afternoon of shopping at the local asian food markets, my friend and I got hungry. Searching for a quick snack to wrap up our shopping without being hangry.\n\nI would have loved to buy more but after shopping, I limited myself. We both got vegetarian sticky rice that was heated for us. Inside the banana leaf was the best sticky rice ever. With soft almonds and chestnuts, perfect snacky. The cashier also pointed to some pastries that were fresh out of the oven. How can you resist fresh pastry? The red bean pastry was very uniquely delcious!\n\nWill deffinitely be making another stop there when I go to shop in the area again. This time i will bring more money!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	We come here for the Bubble Tea because unfortunately, this is the only  place where we can find "real" bubble tea around here. The pearls are a hit or miss. Sometimes they are the perfect texture, sometimes they are undercooked and hard in the middle. Yeah, I'm a bubble tea snob, what can I say. We like the Tarot flavor, kinda heavy but fantastic.\nAs far as the bakery goes, the cakes look nice, but if you have ever tried good asian cakes, these just don't do it. Kind of flavourless.\nBut like I said, they look pretty.\nThe bread is good though, quite authentic and are comparable in price to Van..\nThe owner is super nice...she obviously loves what she does!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I never write reviews BUT I'll make an exception this one because I am tired of having the workers that rarely speaks English and understands English to take my order. Numerous times they've done my orders wrong and when I tell them they smile and say thank you. Seriously? I don't mind Asian workers but atleast someone who speaks and understands English.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Their boba is alright.  I probably will not get it again.  The pastry that I tried was pretty good. Atmosphere is nice, music was a bit loud.  The service was fine but nothing exceptional.  They did have a good selection of pastries and breads.  There is a ten dollar minimum on cards.\n\nI will be back to try the steam buns!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This is THE staple Asian bakery for anyone living in northeast Ohio. Their bread is made fresh daily and they have a very wide selection, ranging from the ham and egg bun to the sweeter chocolate custard bun. They have a definitive Taiwanese influence in their buns, yet they have a unique style to their buns that makes the bakery stand out from a lot of other Asian bakeries I have been to in the United States. I have gone to Koko Bakery almost every week since I moved up to Cleveland and the bread has not gotten old to me even after nearly 10 years of service. Koko Bakery's bubble tea and desserts are comparable to what you can get at other Asian places - still pretty good, but nothing exceptional. However, the buns that you can get for $1-$1.50 definitely stand out to me as something you can't get anywhere else, and this is why Koko Bakery deserves a 5 star rating.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	The tea was sickening sweet. I wanted traditional black tea with tapioca pearls. $7 down the drain and two teas in the trash.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	My favorite bakery!  The best whipped cream cake, reminding me of the ones at Ruby Bakery in my hometown Shanghai.\nI love almost all the pastries there!   But do stay away from their lunch menu.  My husband ordered teriyaki beef and rice which is a frozen dish, heated by microwave oven.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Beautiful cakes and deserts! But my favorite is the bubble tea. Inside have some tables to sit.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I have ordered lunch here a few times. Each time has been great. I highly recommend the Pork Kutsu sandwich. The portion sizes are huge and the prices are cheap. You must try the bubble teas. You can even get delivery on Skipthedishes.com.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Cute shop with yummy pastries! I love the coconut almond pastry, the BBQ pork buns (although very sweet) and the red bean buns. \n\nAnother great thing to know is that they do sell to-go buns! I always end up buying a bag of those.\n\nCoffee is decent, but the bubble teas are a must.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This is definitely the best Chinese bakery and bubble tea place in Cleveland.  The buns are very delicious and they serve a variety of nice lunches - my favorite is the wasabi turkey club sandwich.  The owner and workers are very friendly and they offer free wifi, which means that I sometimes will hang out here all day and use this as my second office.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This might be the only legit Asian bakery in the Northeast Ohio area. The pastries are delicious! I especially enjoy their BBQ pork buns and egg tarts. They also have different flavors of tapioca drinks, the sweetness of which you can customize. \n\nI've tried many of the items here, and I've always enjoyed it.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I almost cried while I found out KOKO Bakery. Every time I miss home food, I will come here. There are many traditional Taiwanese foods there. I have been known this place for a long time. When I were a college student, I like to order a drink, have a bun or bread and stayed there for studying. The place is wifi-free. They display Chinese popular music which makes me feel I am back in Taiwan. The place is pretty clean and bright. Fresh bread is baked every day. My favorite is turkey sandwich which has egg and turkey folded in the bread. I also like Green onion, dried pork or sweet red bean one. Steamed buns are unbelievable. My recommended one is the big meat bun. It has so many things inside include pork, sausage, Chinese mushroom, egg... The birthday cake is made by the same day I ordered. There are a lot of choices to pick for filling in the birthday cake and it is not that sweet which is perfect to me. Cheesecake is soft and light and my friends love it. Drinks are various there. My favorite one is bubble milk tea. However, I always cut sugar half because I do not drink too sweet. Fruit or coffee smoothies are great. Taiwanese shaved ice is good choice in the summer time. Price is reasonable. The owner is really really friendly and nice. How wonderful it is that Cleveland has a place like KOKO Bakery!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	They also make breads...I really like the coconut cream bread. Their sugar donuts and the chicken steamed bun are yummy too. Really want to try the shave ice but ya know it's been freezing lately. Next trip will try a teriyaki bowl.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This place does a fairly good job with its fresh pastries and buns.  Their meals are also decent as well.  The service from the owner is excellent, I walk away with a free sample more often than not.  That said, the boba is incredibly overpriced (almost $4 for a relatively small cup) and is really hit or miss with the quality.  Having lived in California and also had boba in Taiwan, I only come here when I'm extremely desperate for boba tea and have extra spending money.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Koko Bakery reminds me a lot of Asian bakeries back home in Southern California. I love stopping by here every time I'm in the area and stock up on some delicious Asian pastries :) \n\nMy favorite pastries include: \n- Pineapple bun (bo lo bao): Very crispy layer of pineapple-flavored crust on top of a piece of bread. \n- Crispy bun with sour vegetables and pork: this sounds very unappetizing, but trust me, it is bomb[dot]com :D\n- Pork sun rice roll: this is like a large sushi, with pork sun in the middle! I love pork sun in anything, so this was pretty much a given. \nAll of the pastries are priced around $1, so they're very affordable! \n\nThis is one of the few places that sell bubble tea in Cleveland, which kinda sucks :( I loved getting my weekly fix of boba back in LA, but Koko just doesn't do it for me, unfortunately! I've gotten the taro, Thai, Hong Kong, strawberry, and honeydew milk teas. All of them were hugely disappointing because they were just too sweet. Even if you add in more ice, the oober sweetness does not go away :( I guess I'd just have to wait until I visit Southern California to get some authentic milk teas! Despite this, I still love coming here for the pastries :)
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I do not write many reviews but I think I need to share this with others so everyone is aware of and be on guard for it.  \n\n I have ordered their mango cake several times is it is far great and my family loves it.  We have also ordered their buns and other deserts with very little complaints.  I would question their drinks and service there.  I have placed orders for mango cake in advance several times and 4 out 5 time I have been disappointed with their services.  On several occasions I had to wait on my cake for several hours because they gave my cake away or pretend I have never order it.  I would wait in line and ask for it they kept on telling me it is on it way and when it came out from the kitchen they stick it in the display case instead of boxing the cake and hand it to me.  Instead they would continue making all the drinks for the 5 customers that were in line and I continue to wait for my cake while being ignored.  Now I already spent over $100 at the shop and I was in line first waiting on my cake but they continue to serve the individual customer who are only buying stuff that comes up for less than $10.  Terrible! \n\nThey latest incident was on Christmas Eve.  We order a cake and they suggested that they would make make one with more fruit layer on top of my cake but instead they only applied fruit on the perimeter of they cake.  Also my family order bubble tea and in one drink it had a funny taste and we took a sip and told the ladies at the counter that it did not taste right.  Their reply was to buy another one.  I was so pissed off at them and we just left. \n\n My whole family (My mother, uncles, aunties, and cousins, and my wife and kids) have decided to boycott them.  We refused to treated unfairly.   We loved good food but customer service is also goes a long way.  Koko Bakery does not get any love from my family.\n\nI am a Chinese American and I am proud of it
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I pretty much come here when I'm desperate for milk tea. They do make their milk tea out of powder and charge you 3.45 for a regular and 4.50 for a large (+tax, of course). If this place was in California, it wouldn't survive at those prices for powdered milk tea. It's on the sweeter end of milk teas, so for these reasons, I recommend going to CSU China Sea for their milk tea if it's more convenient. Unfortunately, my parallel parking skills would likely end in some fender benders and suddenly, that milk tea that I so craved is going to cost a couple thousand dollars. So I come here.\n\nThe bakery items are ok. I come here a lot towards closing and per my knowledge/experience they don't offer any sort of special (BOGO or half off) after a certain time. Which is a shame since they tend to have 1-2 trays left at the end of the day and it'd be so nice to have a bun for breakfast in the morning.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This place was "aight" there needs to be higher boba stands. This wasn't as good as it "could" have been.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Cheap and tasty. What more could you ask for? Free Wi-fi and outlets. Oh wait, they have that too!\n\nKoko has a great selection of typical Chinese/Taiwanese/Hong Kong style pastries, both sweet and savory. You can even purchase packs of frozen buns in preparation for those long winters! There's a $5 minimum for card, which you shouldn't have too hard of a time doing if you get something for here and something for the road, or bring along a friend. So far, I've stuck mostly with the pastries/buns and everything has been pretty good except for this strange sweet and savory cake thing with pork sung, green onion, and custard... Not sure who made that up but it's not working too well. My friend is a big fan of their savory rice rolls, and one day I'll indulge in one of their too-pretty-to-eat desserts in the refrigerated case. I'm looking at you, mousses.\n\nIt seems like they keep baking throughout the day rather than finishing in the morning, so you'll frequently see trays of fresh bread sitting out on various tables. It's tempting, but try not to steal a nibble.\n\nTheir milktea drinks are hit or miss - some are really sweet and some seem to be heavily artificially-flavored. They have a pretty unique list of flavors - choose wisely! I've also tried the Hong Kong coffee, which is basically all the types of sugar and cream you could think of mixed with coffee, but surprisingly didn't keep me up until 2am. \n\nTwo bathrooms are located in the hallway beyond the door next to the buns. Nothing special to see here, just do your business and go enjoy your treats.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I love Koko! Vegetarian and meat options for a light, inexpensive lunch. My veg favorites are the vegetable and cheese bun from the bakery case, and the tempura fried vegetables from the kitchen. Taro buns and almond rolls for dessert! Comfortable atmosphere with ample seating and a friendly staff. I've never had a bad experience here.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This is the only place I have found in Cleveland that has real rice bowls... the simplicity and deliciousness of katsu on rice -  in a bowl!  Needless to say, I was very happy with my lunch.  As for the boba (bubble tea) - it was okay.  I firmly believe a milk tea with boba should not cost more than $3 (maybe $3.25), but for now I will support it since the tea was decent and boba is too hard to find in Cleveland.  I just wish they were open later!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	If there were a "zero star" option, I would have selected it.  Koko Bakery's cake is delicious - so delicious that we chose it for our wedding.  I live in Columbus, but got married in Cleveland.  I did some research to find a Chinese bakery similar to one in Columbus.  When I found Koko, I was thrilled.  I spoke with the owner, Jessica, several times before I made a special trip to meet with her and try the cake.  \n\nOur appointment should have been our first warning.  She was over 30 minutes late and not apologetic.  Nevertheless, we loved the cake, so we decided to make arrangements for our wedding.  Jessica told us she would get back to us with a quote so we could pay a deposit.\n\nWeeks go by and still no word.  We become nervous and leave message after message.  When we do get a hold of Jessica, she makes excuse after excuse usually having to do with how busy she is running the business.  Why we didn't just say 'forget it' then, I have no idea.  \n\nTime is wasting away - now over a month has passed - and we decide to make one final call.  By this time, we took a firm tone and told her we needed the quote that day, or we would no longer do business with her.  Guess what?  Still no quote.\n\nWe call to let her know how upset (actually, infuriated) and disappointed we are with her poor customer service.  She finally returns our call at 10:30 p.m. the next night and gives us a quote (which was 200.00 higher than the verbal quote we received two months prior).  The best part is at the end of the message she insists that we "get back to her as soon as possible" because she has to "make vacation plans."  Seriously?  Funny, because we had to make "wedding plans," but there was never any urgency on her part.  I was appalled by her nerve.\n\nThe utter lack of professionalism is shameful.  Businesses don't deserve to be successful when they are run with such poor service.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	So Koko is a place I end up going a lot for bubble tea, mainly because it is one of the few places that offers bubble tea!  In other cities with larger populations of Asians, this sort of place is a regular site:  a cute little cafe populated by a bunch of Asians, selling adorable little cakes, Chinese buns, and bubble tea.  Bubble tea, for those of you that don't know, is a popular phenomenon that originated in Taiwan.  It is typically a milk tea or flavored tea (or sometimes a slushy tea) served hot or cold with these large, black, honeyed tapioca balls sitting at the bottom.  They're always served with a large straw in order for you to suck up the tapioca balls as you drink your tea.   All in all, it's an odd but tasty treat for those of us that like it (ie. me!).  Here at Koko, the bubble tea is fairly typical, but can be a bit hit or miss.  They offer a variety of flavors (I usually just go with the plain milk tea), which usually taste fine.  However, the bubbles themselves can sometimes be a bit overcooked and mushy, when they should ideally be soft and chewy.  The bakery also offers a variety of other items, including buns, baked goods, and some meals.  The buns are fairly standard for an Asian bakery;  they didn't particularly stand out or wow me, unfortunately.  They do offer loaves of bread that I did find pretty interesting and worth the price, however.  I particularly like the bread with a cookie topping, reminiscent of a bo lo bun.  The cakes/mousses/other desserts can also be a bit of a hit or miss.  Some cakes desserts are really delicious, while others are not so much.  Most are probably a bit overpriced.  I've only tried the curry there in terms of meals offered, and I was not very impressed;  I would probably stick to getting baked goods here.  Another offering that is pretty unique to this place in Cleveland is the Taiwanese shaved ice.  This is a dessert, again popular in Taiwan, involving a bed of shaved ice, with a mixture of toppings of your choice (often various fruits, jellies, or red/green beans), and condensed milk poured on top.  I was thrilled to see the dessert offered here, and it fulfilled my desires when I got it!  \n\nSo in the end, this is perhaps not the best Asian bakery I've been to, but it's the only place in Cleveland with these unique offerings.  Yes, it can be a bit hit or miss, and perhaps a tad on the expensive side, but maybe I'm just happy that this place exists in the first place.  With that in mind, for the quality and price of the food, I'd probably want to give this place 3 stars, but considering that it's the only place that I can go to fulfill certain needs when I want to, I'll up it to 4.\n\nAlso, just a note for those using credit cards, they have minimum price for credit cards (I think around $5?).  Just FYI
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Had to meet a corporate client in the area who recommended the bubble tea. The tea was average, not like what I remember from SanFran, and it bit sweeter than it should be, IMHO. We got an assortment of buns, though, which were very good. Overall, the atmosphere was not really conducive to a meeting, but it was pleasant.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	It is a very clean and neat place.  There are many kind of pastry kind bread and rolls.  This place has many flavor of bubble tea, I am not a fan of any flavor, so I ordered regular (black tea) bubble tea.  It was pretty good.  Cake looked really good too.  I would recommend this place.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Came here because i heard that there were great pork buns and found a mecca of awesome little Asian sandwiches, buns, & sweets!\n\nHave to say, coming from NY, these bork buns (and mini pork buns) rival that of Mei Lei Wah in NYC Chinatown!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	KoKo Bakery is a place that I think every Clevelander should go to at least once.  It really is the cutest bakery with the most delicious things! Their bubble tea is the best I've ever tasted - the almond is my favorite.\n\nI get random cravings for their baked goods (hello coconut cream bun!) and I wish that I lived next door - though, it's probably better for me that I don't. The case up front is always filled with delightful looking chocolate covered strawberries, cakes, mousse, and other sweet treats.  Anything I've tried has been really great - this place really is impressive.\n\nThe pork buns are on my list to try for my next trip - after all of these reviews, I'm sad that I've missed out on them so far. I just can't pass up all the sweets!  I'm looking forward to my next trip.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Only decent asian bakery in the area.\n\nThis place is an ok place to go for asian pastries and baked goods.  The drinks are more below average- average depending on what you get.  The desert on the other hand were delishhhh.  \n\nThe atmosphere is mostly students in the area that come to hang out and grab a quick bite to eat kind of place.  I do love their baked goods in the main self serve display, but all the good ones are always gone... The only thing that got me was that the baked goods weren't even warm, but more on the cold side.  They charge you 80 cents to microwave the damn things.  so unnecessary...  The vietnamese ice coffee doesn't really taste authentic, but it does its job of providing you with caffeine lol.  \n\nAll in all i recommend this place to a person who hasn't been to or had these types of pastries and such.  Don't set your expectations too high before walking into this place.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Was craving bubble tea and found the closest one to the park that we were visiting and it was delicious! Buns were great too. Lots of selection
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	The Korean shaved ice is amazing! I have yet to try their savory snacks and foods but I plan on it soon. My fiance got a boba/bubble tea and loved it. Can't wait to go back again and again!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	What a cute bakery! We stopped in at Koko for something sweet after having an amazing dinner at Seoul Hot Pot. The bakery itself is cozy, and seems like a good place to study or meet up with friends. \n\nSince they were about to close, we picked a few desserts and bubble teas. I got the Thai tea, which was excellent. My friend got the strawberry, which I thought was a little on the sweet side. The pearls were firm but chewy, the perfect texture in my opinion. Sometimes they fill more than half the cup with ice, so make sure to ask for yours with less ice or no ice if you want more tea.\n\nWe chose the mango cheesecake and the chocolate mousse to go. The credit card machine wasn't working, and unfortunately, we had no cash on us. We had to run around the corner to find an ATM, and return about 15 minutes later to pay for our purchases. The lady at the front (don't know if this was the owner or not) apologized and gave us a few free pastries for the trouble. Super nice of her! \n\nThe biggest downfall, like everyone said, is the price. I was expecting to pay around $13 dollars for two bubble teas and two desserts, but it ended up being around $20. Whoa. Good for every once in a while though.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	KoKo Bakery is great when in the mood for tasty Asian drinks, a snack, a quick lunch, or even a light dinner.  As the name implies, they have a host of delicious Asian baked goods, artistically decorated whole cakes, and many desserts.  The bakery treats go well well when complemented with a delicious bubble tea (many flavors to choose from), a Thai tea, or some other yummy drink.  I keep telling myself to try some of their many other drinks, but I end up getting the usual favorites.  For a quck meal, chicken teriyaki rice bowl is really good.  Favorite bun:  Probably coconut-filled bun (Gai-Mei Bao).  Favorite drink:  Warm thai tea with bubble/boba in the winter, taro bubble tea in the summer.  As with any small business, during busy "rushes" a line can form as the drinks are made-to-order which takes time.  But they are well worth the wait.  Tasty.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Coming to Cleveland from New York I was surprised to find an authentic Chinese bakery.  The quality and variety of the breads and buns are just as good those found in Flushing.  I particularly like the sesame paste buns.  The fresh fruit cakes are also great - light, spongy and not too sweet.  I like to stop by for a snack and bubble tea in the afternoon.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Like many things in Cleveland, this is a diamond in the rough--this place, and Asiatown in general, is not a great part of Cleveland but this IS a great little bakery cafe. Most authentic and delicious bubble tea I've ever tried in the Cleveland area. And the woman who owns it--so nice! I loved her, she let us try 3 different kinds of tea before we even bought it, and she gave us free buns on the way out "just to get you to come back!" But the buns and tea were so good, I would've come back without the freebies. And her other pastries, which I have yet to try, and gorgeous and look so delectable. With the quality of this place, you will forget you're still in the Cleve.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	It's flippin' delicious.\n\nThe selection of Asian pastries and buns is phenomenal... and I think they come out to around 80 cents a piece!  \n\nIt's a clean, well lit bakery.  You select your buns from a cabinet and place them on a tray.  They will heat seal each bun for you so that they all stay fresh.  The buns range from the sweet creme filled varieties to the more savory pork buns.  I happen to love the green onion bun - it's flavorful, and super tasty.\n\nThey also have a large selection of other desserts and cakes -  the "lite cheesecake", is awesome - it's fluffy and more towards a spongecake.  \n\nThe owner is wonderful, and they are happy to fulfill special orders.\n\nThe only thing I would skip is the bubble tea... While I'm not a connoisseur of the drink, I have enjoyed it much more in other cities... when I tried it here it was so sweet I could not finish it.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Came here for the Boba Tea, not impressed at all. They use powder, plus the flavors taste nothing like the flavor your ordered. Mine was a little too watery.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I love Koko Bakery, not just because of it's amazing baked buns and desserts, but also because of it's Asian flavors and treats.\nTheir pineapple red bean buns always fill me with delight, and their egg tarts are smooth and decadent. I also love their normal red bean buns as well, and their savory buns aren't half bad either. \nThe buns are a relatively low price, but their desserts are a little more expensive.\nDespite that, I always love the mango mousse. It's consistently amazing, although I cannot say the same for their green tea mousse. The one time I got it, the whole cream was stale and hard. Not appetizing at all.\nI also have tried their mango cheesecake, which is on the lighter side but still pretty yum. The crust for their fruit tarts always fills me with joy, and their red bean mooncakes and pastries are absolutely divine.\nThey only have the mooncakes a few weeks before the Moon Festival, but it only makes them more worth it. I've also had their red bean loaf, which is similar to the bun. (Anything red bean, I love.)\nThe taro loaf is nice as well. I find that the flavor is sweeter in the loaf than in the bun, which I like. Their almond biscotti is also the perfect snack or treat!\nThe only thing I don't like is the fact that most of the buns are gone if you go too late, so go early in the morning!\nThe bubble tea is good as well, but there are no outstanding or defining qualities. Beware, the strawberry bubble tea is actually an icy strawberry smoothie, not milky! The taro bubble tea is milky though, and I always order it if I go to Koko's Bakery.\nSince I'm Chinese, I will always love and support this bakery. Their dedication into each and every one of their desserts, buns, or drinks never fails to amaze me.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	As Rachel B. probably knows by now, I'm totally stalking her reviews and lists!  lol\n\nAfter all that pork bun talk, I had a craving for one the other day after work, swung by on the way home (it's probably not good at all that this place is so close to both my work and my house!) to pick up two BBQ pork buns.....ummmm, I'm lucky I escaped from here with ONLY those!  This place is one of the cleanest and nicest bakeries I've been to in Cleveland.  Their desserts all look like they were forged by the delicate hands of a true artist.  Not only Chinese offerings, but standard American desserts are available as well.\n\n$1.80 for two giant pork buns?  Yes please, I'll be back!  Red bean is next on my list....
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This is definitely the best Asian bakery around here. They do everything well. All of the pastries and snacks I have tried are fantastic. The same goes for the desserts and drinks. I am a fan of regular Boba Milk tea and they do it well - great rich flavor and the boba is not too soft and not too chewy. They know what they are doing. The food I have tried there is also very good. I got the Chicken Katsu lunch combo and enjoyed it. The dining area is clean and bright. The bathrooms are clean. The people who work there are also very nice. One of my favorite places to grab a bite or a drink and just hang out.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	One star for their ripe off fake papaya smoothie.. I asked for real fruit smoothie and they said they charge $1 for it, so I went for it thinking for $6 it must be good. I got it and it was completely artificial favored. They probably only put one or two pieces of fruit and the rest powder. The worse and most expensive papaya drink I had ever had in my life!!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I have been visiting this bakery for many many times. I love their BBQ pork puff and BBQ pork bun. Their pork and chive steamed bun is also great. The price of their bakeries are reasonable. Average price for bun and puff is $1.50. Beside good bakeries and reasonable price, I also love the friendliness of the staffs and the owner here. Everyone I met here are very friendly, polite, and have very good service mind. The cleanliness of their store is also another thing I like. Overall, I think this place is well deserved a five-star rating.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Stopped by to pick up half a dozen pineapple buns for breakfast next week for the family. Everything was fresh. They usually sell jewelry by the cash register but not anymore most likely from new management. The desserts look much prettier now and I didn't spot the $2 fruit parfait they often have, hope it's not permanent! :) Great place for tea or coffee ~~
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This is a place that took me 5 visits to love because I was so unprepared/unfamiliar with what they offer that I needed many visits to to find my go-to items. They have lots of "buns". Imagine if the sticky pork buns you know from dim-sum collided with dunkin' donuts. egg creme buns, chocolate creme buns several shelves of weird sweet buns. My wife loves them. I could care less. Because they have Curry beef donut (like a jelly donut but with curried beef inside). Holy Snap! and Chicken mushroom donut! and multiple pork and egg puff pastries and some kind of bun with a hot dog sticking out of it! \nIn addition the have a variety of steamable buns. vegetable, green vegetable bbq pork, etc. I just got a new one pork and vegetable. can't wait for lunch. There offer many more cake like pastries that i haven't delved into. They have a bunch of tea and sweetened coffee drinks and of course bubble tea.\nFor the exploratory cleveland eater this place is a must. \nMy wife insists I give her credit for dragging me here the first couple times. Which she did.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	They are hands-down the best place for pork and sweet buns around. The pastries are delicious, but why pay $5 for a chocolate mouse when I can get an even more delicious chocolate bun for less than a dollar? Their chocolate, coconut-cranberry, and pineapple buns are to die for. I've put myself in a bread-induced food coma several times eating here; it's well worth it.\n\nThe bubble tea isn't the best I've had, but they do have several options. Now they've added jelly alongside boba, so that's a plus.\n\nA word of caution though: Be careful if it is near closing and you are looking at the hot-dog or any of the buns with egg or meat. Not a good idea...you will feel sick.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Great place to hang out with friends or study. They have free wifi there and plenty of great eats. (i.e baked goods, buns, bubble tea, dessert, etc). Expect to pay a little extra than your average Asian market store - they make their buns on their own and usually is more healthy. I haven't tried thier bubble tea yet but heard it was good so I'll get that next time. I ordered their Korean shaved ice and it had the shaved ice, red bean, choice of ice cream flavor (strawberry, chocolate, vanilla), cocunut milk (I think), and some fresh fruit. It was good as always. There were samples laid out as well, many to choose from. The sponge cake I had as a sample was really good: soft and not too sweet. \n\nOther than that, the place is cute and they play some nice up to date music - Jay Chou! Located right across from Seoul Hot Pot and in the Korean plaza.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	If you like bubble tea then this place is the best spot in Cleveland. There's not a bubble tea I haven't liked from them.  One of the few places that I given a full 5 stars. \n\nI'm a bubble tea connoisseur and no place comes close!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I gave this place 3 stars because it has many interesting types of cakes, cookies, breads. (pretty chinese bakeries considering we are in cleveland)   Some are good, some are not so good.  This is a good place to visit if you like bubble tea (tapioca tea).  However, I found that their drinks and food are either little too salty or sweet for my taste.  Don't get the egg tarts there, they are not very good and overpriced.  Service is good, I like free samples!  Overall, beautiful presentations, many selections, avg taste, overpriced on many items tho.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Great place to visit as the have a wonderful selection of delectable Asian Desserts.  Almost too pretty to eat!  Tried the Coconut \nRoll, it was marvelous!  Never had such a great roll in my life!  Fresh, soft, fluffy and sweet, filled with coconut cream!  Should have bought a dozen!  I will be back!!!!!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Disclaimer: my mom lives in NYC so I've been exposed to really amazing bubble tea and bakeries. \n\nFor Cleveland standards, Koko is probably the best available, which isn't saying too much. The bubble tea is way too sweet. Also I've watched them make it and they use mostly artificial flavors and creamers, which is disappointing. The breads I've had are mediocre and not as fluffy as other bakeries. All in all, a decent place but not the best.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I am grateful that there is a bakery in this city that offers Taiwanese pastries, drinks, lunch items, and even taiwanese and korean shaved ice?? papingsu? However, I am biased with my 2 stars since I grew up in California and go back to Asia often... hard to compare with that. I haven't tried the boba since I usually go to CSU China Sea for that, but their HK style milk tea is pretty good. Their pastries look and taste different from what I'm used to...
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	koko-- you're okok!\n\n(sorry, couldn't resist.)\n\nafter moving here from California to get in touch my inner white man, the first order of business was to find a place where i could satisfy my red bean fix.  (old habits are hard to break.)\n\nso, Cleve-- if you ever need fresh Chinese sweet and savory baked goods or passable bubble tea-- Koko Bakery is it.\n\nquality-wise, it's not quite up there with something like a Sheng Kee or TapEx in California.  also, note that most of Koko's boba drinks are made from powdered flavoring.  the prices for some things are also comparatively higher than a Cali Chinese bakery-- particularly their cakes.\n\nbut in my 2 months here, i haven't found another asian bakery in the Cleve with the same freshness and selection.\n\ngosh, i keep talking up Cali like she's my ex-girlfriend.  obviously, i'm not over the relationship.\n\nKoko-- you'll just have to be my rebound.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	If you are anywhere near Asian town (and its not Tuesday) you need to stop by and pick up some of the best priced, most delicious bakery you can find in Cleveland.  I love working nearby as you can get lunch buns for only a couple of dollars.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Update: my foodie friend who is much better than I with baked goods advised me after sampling one of the mandarin orange cakes that it is, in fact, a well-made French-style sponge cake.  As you can tell from the update, I still go back for mandarin orange cakes whenever I'm in the area.  I'm almost afraid to post about them because there is no way they won't have a line out the door once people catch on...
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I absolutely loved this place. It was a major hit for our first place to go on our girls weekend. The owner is a happy sweet lady that goes way out of her way to make sure we enjoy ourselves. We went crazy and ordered mango pudding, mouse cake, triple chocolate something, custard bun, onion bun, curry bun, and 4 fruit tarts. We also ordered rice bowls for lunch. Rice bowl BBQ was just ok. The BBQ was sweeter than what I'm used to for chinese BBQ but for $5 I can't complain much. We planned on having wine, dessert, and cheese later in our hotel and she was glad to give us cups and utensils. I heart her! Must go back.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I have been craving Boba all week, so I finally gave in and came to Koko bakery. \n\nI definitely have had much better Boba, but this place might be the best in Cleveland. Milk tea is my favorite!! I like it iced or cold, dependent on weather. Their bakery is not bad either, but overpriced!! \n\nI would recommend this place for a sweet treat after an Asian meal in Chinatown!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	This is the only Chinese bakery in Cleveland, as far as I know. It'll fill a need, and that's all. Nothing more, nothing less. \n\nI'm not sure what their most popular items are, but in my "professional" opinion the pork bun wins. Who doesn't love those suckers? I went in while I was in town and they had 3 measly ones sitting in their sad miniature oven- I wanted at least 6, so I went to the counter to ask for more and they had nothing to offer me but a 40 minute wait so that they could make them. \n\nKind of a loss for them, in my book. If you don't have the product, people will not buy, and they will not come back or sit around for 40 minutes to wait for it. It's a bakery- keep some items in stock.\n\nWhat I've had from here is pretty decent and will kill the cravings, so I continue to go if I'm around.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Everything is made pretty here but not always taste yummy... The best time to come is mornings when everything is still fresh and new. Don't go afternoon expecting fresh pastries.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	First of all, I'm from LA, land of all yummy things Asian-food-related in this country, so my opinion of the quality of the food and taste are probably unfair for Cleveland's modest Asian community. \n\nHowever, I don't think I have unreasonable expectations for customer service. Last night, I went in to grab some steamed buns for a quick bite while my family ran some errands. They have cold refrigerated steam buns (pork, vegetable, other options) in the fridge out in the seating area of the bakery. They offer fresh steamed buns as well. So of course, I ordered half a dozen. Now, I don't know about anyone else, but having had many a steamed bun in my day, I know that several of them can be put in a steamer at once.  I stood there and waited for, no joke, 40 minutes. And when I asked how long it would be, the little girls working there said, "uh, five minutes". 10 minutes later, the owner who usually works the counter finally asked me if someone had helped me. So I mentioned that I was waiting for steamed buns and that I had been waiting a long time. \n\nSo.. get this. They finally come out. Fine. Then as I walk up to the counter to get them, she says to me with an attitude, "you know, these buns, they take time. Yeah. They take time, you know. Each one, takes like a minute. Next time, if you're in such a hurry, do it yourself. Go home and heat it up yourself." Hostile, if you can believe it. \n\nSo maybe it's just me. Maybe my idea of a bakery offering a heated version of something they have sitting out, or even a freshly made something, should have been quicker. Either that or, if it was going to take 40 minutes to make, maybe a heads up would have been in order. Who knows? I guess I'm an unreasonable person. But add that to the hostile, unapologetic, "do it yourself then" comments afterwards? Wow. \n\nI was a big fan of this little place until I got this little gem. Not to mention that the steam buns were disgusting, and so was the little sticky rice banana leaf bundle we got. We took a bite and had to throw them all out. Not just me, who might have been biased by my nasty little experience, but also my husband and my son. Literally, had to throw them out immediately because they were smelling up the car in a disgusting way. \n\nAnyway, so I hate to write something like this but I slept on it and am still really pissed about the experience. and now that I think on it, the last time I went here for lunch with a friend, my katsu came out cold and the sauce was pretty gross, and it also took a long time. Shoulda known. But didn't think they'd be total B*s about it. \n\nNot going back, EVER. Would NOT recommend. Thanks for letting me vent.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Not to be confused with Cuckoo Bakery, where you can buy birds and noisy clocks, Cocky Bakery, where they say they have the best baked goods in the world but can't really back it up, and Cock Bakery, which is owned by a Rooster. Or is it a sex shop, I forget. But anyway.\n\nWhat to get: Bubble Tea\nWhat not to get: A Cocky Cuckoo\n\nAdvice: Up the bubble tea game, add a Brown Sugar Milk Tea, make the Milk Tea taste a bit more substantial.\n\nKoko Bakery has plenty of things going for it:\n\n- It has good Bubble Tea in a town that doesn't have good Bubble Tea\n- The girls working here are super friendly and nice, the service is the strongest point\n- Lots of baked goods, not the best I've ever had but there are some good items here\n- Lots of cute young customers that I am attracted to (and that's just the boys)\n- The Taro tea here is probably stronger than the other Milk Teas I've tried\n\nIronically I only got the Taro because the girls working here insisted I try it. They were right, it's good.\n\nOn the downside, the regular Milk Tea is a little weak and bland, and my appreciation for this place is skewed by the fact that I came across the girl of my dreams here, she kept smiling at me, lots of looks were exchanged, she was dark and dangerous and had loads of tattoos. Sadly, like two ships passing in the night, I had to answer a call and she was gone and the connection was missed. Now I feel like James Blunt in that song.\n\nSHE WAS WITH ANOTHER MANNNNN!\n\nExcept she wasn't. And this didn't happen on a Subway. And I don't do drugs. But anyway.\n\nDefinitely worth trying if you like Asian Bakeries and Bubble Teas and happen to be in the CLE, known to some as The Land.\n\nAnd if it were the Coco Bakery, I'd order anything but Ice T, because I prefer my Coco without Ice T.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I have to say, I am so happy this place exists. If I want quick, tasty asian baked goods and drinks this place hits the spot so good. A really great variety of stuff, very solid prices, it's cute, clean and delicious. Kind of a nice mix of more american slanted stuff and things that are more true to their roots. Buns galore, lovely asian-european little deserts, and about fifty types of fun little drinks from vietnamese coffee to bubble tea. I've even gotten my birthday cakes here a few times, which while they do seem a tad expensive, are really lovely and unique compared to a typical american cake. One of my NE ohio favorite spots.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Coming from Rowland Heights, California, I've been dying for a taste of home ever since I moved to Ohio. Upon arrival Koko bakery immediately reminded me of JJ Bakery in Rowland Heights. There were cute little pastries, cakes, and offered a large menu of drinks. I ordered a mango pudding, slice of chocolate cake, and 2 small bobas. Total was $18.30. Ouch. Was it worth it? Yes. Although the small bobas was 90% filled with ice. I recommend that you ask for no to light ice lest you be jipped of delicious tea/juice/whatever. I liked that the tapioca was actually fresh and not at all stale tasting like some places I've tried. The pastries were delicious and semi-worth the $4.50 each that I paid for them.
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I had the rice bowl with chicken and it was amazing.  The chicken was perfectly grilled (not fried or smothered in sauce!).  I also tried a bubble tea for the first time.  That was an experience! Bubble tea has "bubbles" in it.....those bubbles are large tapioca balls!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I have a soft spot for steamed buns and Koko did not disappoint! \n\nWe went right at closing so there were not a ton of options, but they did have what I came for - Red bean buns, Pork Buns, and BBQ pork buns. I also got a Thai tea boba to try out. Its been YEARS since I'd had a boba drink (at least 10 years). The boba was good, small enough and chewy. The Thai tea was not as strong as I'm used to but still good. When paying for the buns to go, I asked for reheating instructions (wrap in plastic wrap with a little splash of water, microwave for 20 seconds each side, more if the buns are cold). The bread is soft, chewy, and slightly sweet, almost like a Hawaiian bread - like it should be! The fillings were all good. I highly getting the BBQ if you haven't tried it before. It made me think of a pulled pork BBQ sandwich in Texas, amazing how food can do that!\n\nAgain, we went at closing, so sadly there were not a lot of sweets left. I'm more than willing to come back again in order to try more options!
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Koko... I keep coming because there are no other options! Ugh. I upped it to two stars because the visit was better this time - no flies in the baked goods display, bubble tea made to specifications and fast, dough all cooked. \n\nHere's my issue this time... baked goods balanced on the trash. I kid you not, I took a photo. Is that even up to health code??
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	Hands-down, by far the best Bobo tea in Cleveland area.. If it was healthy, you would see me there everyday.. Still, I try to go there weekly as a treat to myself for being awesome:)~ The only reason why It didn't deserve 5 stars cause I personally think the price is too high for Cleveland...
1cLXGXThDYZ5WK_KpBLtkw	I love the bubble tea here. I had the strawberry (recommended by the staff) and it was delicious. My friend has been going here for years and got her bubble tea got which she also enjoyed. The interior is cute and friendly. The staff was very nice and overall the place had a hipster vibe. I didn't try an of the baked goods, but they looked fantastic. I'm definitely going back soon and will update about the pastry then!
L1XHTn7S-6har9UGAPjcWQ	So much hype around Papa Chang's third location in Richmond Hill. This location is in the same plaza as Golden Court and Yu Seafood, tucked away in the back. However, even though it's in the back, it is super busy! Came on a Sunday afternoon at 2pm during soft opening and it was still a 15 minute wait for table for 4!\n\nOnto the food. The popcorn chicken C04 is really, really good, as well as their chicken cutlet. The noodle N03 that is served with the chicken cutlet is egg noodles, and it is so so. I'd say get the rice instead. The signature beef noodle N06 was decent. We also ordered a pork floss omelette P01 and this was also a tasty choice. You can't go wrong with pork floss!\n\nTheir value combos include a drink and a dessert, for an extra $5. This may seem like a good deal, as all the drinks are minimum $5 anyways. However, their drinks suck! I'd save the $5 and go across the street afterwards to Commerce Gate where you have all the elite bubble tea places to choose from!\n\nIn summary, make sure you order the popcorn chicken! Their rice is better than the noodles and don't upgrade to the combos unless you want a crappy drink!
L1XHTn7S-6har9UGAPjcWQ	A few days ago I visited this new Papa Chang's, I felt so disappointed. I ordered the salty fish cakes and roasted milk tea to take out, at the first they told me to wait for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes they said they don't have the salty fish cakes, but they can give me the deep fried fish cakes. However, when I went home I found that they gave me the salty fish cakes but not the deep fried one......Plus, I was waiting for the drinks at least 15 minutes, even it was already done. There were 4 to 5 servers were just standing next to the bar, but they just keep chatting and no one realized that the drink was ready. The "bartender" didn't tell us too because he was busy on discussing the duty roster or studying the drinks?\nI think I may not come back to this location despite I like Papa Chang's. I think this store was too new, so the waitress were not very familiar to the working process.
L1XHTn7S-6har9UGAPjcWQ	I was in the plaza to get lunch on Saturday when I saw Papa Chang's sign. At first I thought it was a "Papa Chang's wanna be store" because I had never heard that they were opening a new location, but when I saw the famous logo of Papa Chang's I knew it was the real one! I went with my husband and we were checking to see if it was already opened or if it was still under construction. Apparently it was opened and had couple tables occupied by customers. We both were so happy and immediately told our friends that Papa Chang's opened a new location that's closer to us. \n\nThey food offerings were pretty much the same as the original location, but at this location they added combo menu, which includes one of their famous dishes, bubble tea, pudding and fruit. I got the minced pork and sausage combo and my husband got the popcorn chicken combo. The taste was same as the original location, it was delicious and the portions were​ also the same size. The combos we got were about $11-12 each and the other combo options were around same price. We got the combo because we knew we could get discount if we liked their page on Facebook lol. \n\nWhen I paid I asked since when they opened the restaurant there and the server said it was the first day. No wonder I couldn't find it on yelp yet that day to check in. \n\nThe reason I gave them 4 stars is because they had this oil/frying smell that bothered me a lot as soon as I entered the restaurant. Maybe they had issue with their venting. I hope they fix it as soon as possible because I have never had a problem with the other location. \n\nOther than that, I'm super happy they opened this new location on highway 7, which is so much closer to home!
L1XHTn7S-6har9UGAPjcWQ	OMG!!! Papa Chang's has opened a third location, this time in Richmond Hill. The 3rd location is located in the Hwy 7 and West Beaver Creek Plaza, right next to Fav Cafe. This is the same plaza as Yu Seafood, Golden Court and Crab Harbour.\n\nI was in the area today to pick up some items when I saw the new business sign: Papa Chang's Tea Bistro. My eyes widened immediately. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the Papa Chang sign and thought I was dreaming. I quickly went up to the place and saw a notice on the door that said they just opened over the weekend.  For their grand opening, this new location is offering  a 20% discount promo if you like their FB page.\n\nI told my friend about this new place and we both got excited. We decided to stop by later for a quick bite. We got there exactly at 920 pm and they told us it was last call soon.\n\nBrowsing the nice colourful and glossy menu, all the items were available to be ordered. In addition, the food items are exactly the same as the original location. Nothing seems to be missing. new on the menu is a vast listing of bbt milk tea drinks.\n\nPopcorn chicken is definitely a must and is one of their specialty item. We quickly ordered that, the fish skewers and the Taiwanese Beef Omelette. The food came out quite fast. Other than the food, we shared a can of apple cider. All in all, with the discount, it was $10 per person..tax and tips included. Food wise: taste and quality are exactly the same as the original location. I am so glad they kept the consistency. Could have ordered more but could only eat so much. Definitely can't wait to go back and order more of my favourite items from Papa Chang.\n\n This location has about 24 seats and is definitely more comfortable and colourful than the one on 16th  It feels definitely more relax and enjoyable and u don't feel as stressed.\n\nHow much do I love Papa Chang? well, I once waited 35+ mins for a table for two and once we placed the order, we waited another 45 minutes for the food..  I WAS SO STARVING AT THAT TIME... This is how much I loved that place. Since then, the food comes out super fast.\n\n\nPapa Chang is the #1 Best Taiwanese food in town!!! There is no comparison between other places that offer Taiwanese food. I am quite mesmerized by their vast selection of food items. I think I tried almost everything on their menu.\n\nPeople complained about how far it is and how small the place it.. well, now they can't complain anymore since there is another franchise in town and the restaurant is much bigger in size. \n\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant and to anyone visiting Toronto!!! :D  A MUST TRY!!\n\nCongrats on the new location Papa Chang's
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	Great baked good for great prices, hit the up early for the freshest goodness.
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	This little café is a nice addition to the area.  Although the name implies a Parisian style bakery it is more Portuguese style baking.  It is quant, clean and very modest.  I have stopped in here before for a latte and was pretty disappointed.  Not that I claim to be a coffee aficionado or anything but the latte was a powder mixture ala Tim Hortin's style. I think I ended up throwing it out which was such a waste. I have not rushed back since.  I must say the ambiance was nice and had a strong community feel to it.  Everyone seemed friendly and helpful.  Maybe I will give it another chance.
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	The service is ok. The food was mediocre and the hot chocolate tasted like it was from a packet. It was sad that it is close to the laundromat as it would be a nice place to wait. Not a repeat visit.
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	This is a fascinating little bakery. It caters heavily to the local community of Portuguese residents. Don't let the name fool you, this is NOT a Parisian style bakery, the owner merely lived there for a time in her life.\n\nThese authentic Portuguese pastries and breads are phenomenal. The buns are the star of the show, at 45 cents people often come in and by large bags. Or if they live very close, buy the bread they need daily.  The crusts are indeed a symphony of crackles, with a very light and fluffy interior . Don't look for heavy breads here.\n\nTheir donuts are fantastic, and one is all you need, trust me!  I'm a huge fan of their custard, orange and almond tarts.  Their cream pastries are  have thick rich fillings.  Be careful when getting their phyllo dough pastries, make sure they are fresh that day.\n\nThe coffee here is fantastic. They also make a pile of sandwiches each morning and sell them through the day: egg salad, chicken cold cuts or salami.  I particularly enjoy their egg salad.  They also have those shrimp pocket and cod fish pastries that are so common in Portuguese bakeries. \n\nOften at about 9:30 - 10:30 am they have two or three freshly made pizza's come out of the oven. They only do this once a day.  If you catch it at exactly the right time, you can have a piping how slice of pizza for breakfast. It's sinfully delicious.\n\nYou'll find there are always Portuguese gentlemen sitting around the bakery, drinking a beer and quietly watching a soccer game. It's a comfortable atmosphere, but you get the idea that their liquor license lets them sell their food extra cheap.  I'm grateful as their prices are incredibly good.
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	Simply the best white bread in Toronto. Mafra, ( an American football shaped roll), is my personal favourite, but all, - rolls, loaves, baguettes etc are exceptional, they bake at least half a dozen times a day. \nThey have a good selection of pastries as well. They are not French, but Portuguese and very informal.\nThis is not a health food, whole grain, new age,  sort of place, so if that is what you are after, avoid.\nFine service, and you can get a decent coffee, a beer or  standard sandwich there too.\nWhenever I produce their bread at dinner parties, the guests are in rapture.
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	Paris bakery is not actually a French bakery contrary to what the name may suggest.  The do however serve European baked goods and mainly Portuguese inspired breads and pastries. \n\nThe food is quite fresh and pastries and breads are all baked on the day they are put out for sale in the cafe.  The croissants are crisp and the bread is made well, but the flavours do not particularly stand out by any means.  I usually pick up bread rolls and a couple flaked pastries, but there isn't anything really that will blow you away about the taste or way they are prepared. \n\nThe staff however are friendly and polite.  They answer any questions you have about your food without hesitation.  A nice place to drop by for a quick lunch and the price is definitely right!
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	Not the best. Small coffee reminds me of the old Tim Hortons sizes, when "small"  meant "a dab". Tried the tiramisu (2.95) and the egg custard tart (1.05). The tiramisu has no coffee taste, just seems like cocoa sprinkled on vanilla cake. The egg custard tart was a bit better but nothing to write home about.
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	Wow.. I never experience anything like this before.\n\nThere were 3 incidences involving in the span of 3 hours when I was there.  From underage drinking, a drunk gentleman buying drinks for said minors and finally, a loud disgruntled man getting violent with other patrons.  My gf and I promptly left as we feared that someone was going to get hurt.  Never in my life have I experience that. \n\nI can understand that a cafe cannot control a customer's behaviour to a certain extent, HOWEVER... perhaps it's time to re-think the whole "alcohol" in a cafe scheme.   \n\nI strongly believe that if an establishment presents itself as a quaint parisienne cafe it should follow through in every detail.  Alcohol is certainly not needed in a place like this.
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	Steer well clear of this one. Bought a croissant which turned out to be as heavy as a loaf of bread. Washrooms don't have soap. Seems more like a hangout for locals to drink domestic beer and get aggressive in the middle of the afternoon.
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	Just go here and buy bread, egg tarts, and sugar donuts. You can't go wrong, and can then ignore what everyone else is complaining about. The bread is amazing. The medium sized loaves are constantly being bought so it's rare I go here and don't leave with warm bread. The prices are amazing as well. They sell ham and cheese if you want to DIY a good sandwich. The place looks a bit dumpy, and there are always old dudes drinking at the back bar or at the handful of tables inside. It adds to the charm of the place.
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	4.5 stars.\n\nThis place is fantastic. The prices are very reasonable, and I haven't had anything from them that was less than great!! I hesitate to give the full five stars (gotta save those for the super special places) only because it's a perfect place for those that live in the surrounding area. It's probably not worth travelling great distances, unless your pastries mean that much to you - they don't to me.\n\nThat all being said - the real hidden gem here is their pizza. A slice is something like $1.50, and it's incredible. The crust is some kind of flaky... mmmmmm. Seriously, I know it's random, but check it out. My friend bought a slice only because she was starving at the time, and we wound up ordering 3 more and making a mid-afternoon meal out of it. I understand you can call them up and order a whole pizza made to order for pickup if you wish. Check it out!
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	Great coffee, great pastries! Everything is made fresh and looks delicious. I tried a sweet egg croissant for the first time and it was amazing! The decor leaves a little to be desired, but the delicious everything makes up for it.
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	wow! I was just walking around the neighbourhood and this place drew me in. It looks really authentic, catering to portugese people (not french, despite what the store name says). All their bread look extremely fresh. There desserts looked really yummy too. We tried the portugese custard tart and it was delicious. Also had some other flaky pastry that has custard inside and it was great too. Will definitely be back for more! The prices are great too!
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	I really want to like this bakery because every time I pass by I can smell freshly baked bread.  The few times I did try (before and after the renovation) were chocolate eclair, tiramisu, crème brûlée, and the Portuguese cookie.  The chocolate eclair was hard, the tiramisu was watery, the crème brûlée looked and tasted burnt, the Portuguese cookie was hard and tasteless.  The pastries might look decent but the taste certainly not.  They also sell bread, sandwiches, and pizzas there, though I never tried.  My coworkers had seen some expired cold cut and what seemed like droppings in the bread there before the renovation.  I don't like how the bread is all just out there on the rack for everyone to touch, it's just not very hygienic.  There are always old men hanging out and drinking there since they serve alcohol.
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	Portugese bakery at Lansdowne/Wallace. Visited a few days ago and bought a variety of things. \n\nDecently sized. Good lighting. Large variety of pastries/bread (not so much for anything containing meat/veggies). \n\nStaff are fairly good with answering questions but the woman who was helping me faltered a bit with her English when telling me about certain pastries, a few times, when I asked what something was, her answer was "Portugese pastry".... Well, yes, I know it's Portugese, you didn't fool me with your business name, but when I ask what something is, I generally wanna know what's in it, maybe how it's made... \n\nNothing was extraordinarily fresh or good. Probably wouldn't return just based on a few different factors. Not to mention that there are always middle/old Portugese men there who leer at girls like me.
kEq7eudoX5qdcaSLAq3axw	Great bakery --- with a large variety of goods, however most are not Parisian pastries.\n\nThey have a lot of great Portugese breads and pastries, although they also have croissants, cream horns, croissants, cakes etc.\n\nLots of great custard slices, tarts and coconut tarts.\nIt was hard to know what to try --- will be back again for something else.\n\nOn this occasion I bought:\n- some large bread rolls --- outstanding - chewy crust, light interior\n- some cream cannoli's -- awesome and fresh! -- they also have chocolate flavour - I will be trying them next time\n- cream horns --- these reminded me of a bakery I used to go to long ago --- flaky pastry filled with cream and covered with eclair like chocolate - yum yum
UZShf6G75npKCCjiHsf46Q	I know, I know, I keep writing reviews about this area because my office is nearby.  We already know how I feel about Lawrence Square, but Fortinos?  It's great!  This supermarket is like a ray of sunlight to me.  \n\nIt is clean, big, has all the sections anyone could need, including take out, a cafe, The WIne Rack and a pharmacy.  They also have a garden center in the back in the spring.\n\nI was too lazy to make lunch today, so I went across and bought all the ingredients for an awesome sandwich.  Brought everything back to the office, put all unused items in the fridge and now I am eating an awesome sandwich.\n\nNow that I am full I will check out the new, massive Dollarama!
UZShf6G75npKCCjiHsf46Q	It is a pleasure to shop there and the butcher and produce manager are top notch. Lawrence in the meat department can do any kind of cut you want. Because of their very diversified clients you can find many obtuse things that are not normally stocked in general supermarkets. The produce section usually looks as if someone just staged it for a film shoot.
UZShf6G75npKCCjiHsf46Q	I love coming here on to get my groceries.  I love the fresh fish selection.  The store is organized can find my way for items I need.  This place is first choice to grocery stop.  I just buy what I need for the week and if I am out of items I just stop by and buy what I need.  My only concern is that one time I asked for a specific item and was not directed to it.  I was told to go to a certain isle and than turns out that it was not in that isle.  Must have been a new recruit that I asked.
UZShf6G75npKCCjiHsf46Q	I have been shopping at this Fortinos for almost a year. It is just behind the Lawrance square shopping center and next to Allan expressway. Like all other stores owned and operated by Loblaw, this store also carries almost all the same products along with PC products and PC financial services. This store also has a wine shop within. The store is clean, spacious, has enough checkouts and a large parking lot of it's own. Produces, seafood and meats are fresh especially during weekend. Since it is in Jewish neghbourhood, you will also find dedicated Kosher food aisle here.
UZShf6G75npKCCjiHsf46Q	Good selection, good prices, horrendous customer service. Rude cashiers, non-existent bakery staff and completely disinterested managers. The result is a weird mix of great and awful.
UZShf6G75npKCCjiHsf46Q	In a metropolis of 5 million people, Toronto boasts the largest Italian population outside of Italy. Anyone who visits Fortino's will leave speaking Italian...mortadella, salami, fettucini, lavazza, mozzarella....are you following me?! I promise you that all of the bakery and breads are low calorie and card-free....!!!\nNot a perfect area, but worth the visit. Clean and stocked.\nLooking forward to the mile-high Italian sandwiches for our picnic - BUON APPETITO!
UZShf6G75npKCCjiHsf46Q	This is a welcome sight. I love the Fortinos brand. This Fortinos may not be as pretty or the shelves may not carry the variety of items as other Fortinos do. But I was very happy to discover it. Much better than the other discount food stores and I'll take a Fortinos over a Metro any day :)\nThe location is clean. The staff  are friendly. The Wine Rack has the same hours as the store, except Sundays. Which means a great place to pick up the emergency wine bottle.
UZShf6G75npKCCjiHsf46Q	If you're looking for fresh food, I'd look elsewhere. Always have a difficult time picking out most of my fresh vegetables. Bought some fresh mozzarella the other day (about Dec 14) and when I went to eat it, I noticed the liquid had congealed and the expiry date on it was Nov 22 - how is cheese still on the shelf that's almost a month old? Deli manager told me to see him next time I was in since I had wasted $9 on that cheese and I've yet to catch him after three separate trips in a week. Went to buy some fresh basa fillets from the counter yesterday, when she put the fillet on the scale it was frozen solid... if I wanted frozen fish, I wouldn't be at the counter. The only good thing about this place is the location and they generally have good sales going on for the packaged products in the aisle and it's nice for the rewards you can collect to save money. Just be cautious of what you're buying and keep receipts to exchange product that is apparently already rotten when you get home.
UZShf6G75npKCCjiHsf46Q	This is a pretty good grocery store in a really sketchy mall. They have a PC bank machine and a Wine Rack. The produce section is one of the nicest and neatest I've seen and prices seem pretty good. I'd say it's somewhere between a No Frills and a Loblaws. I wasn't looking for any of my staples, though, so I can't say what the pricing is like. \n\nParking is plentiful, but it's kind of hard to get out of the lot when it's rush hour, and you're a slave to the light.
LLNmo66wO1xoi-yma1HybA	Initially Hyde Out seems pretty promising - the decor is pretty spectacular, and the cocktail menu is interesting and extensive. The food menu also seems a bit more upmarket than most else on offer in the area.\n\n\n However, I've been a few times now and it doesn't seem to quite live up to it's initial impression. Each time I've ordered a cocktail only to be told that they can't make it as they have run out of a crucial ingredient. Similarly, my second choice drinks have been made with poor substitutes - Zubrowka with cheap apple juice is not the same as with cloudy pressed apple juice. For a bar that is trying to promote itself as a notch above the competition this seems a bit shoddy.\n\n\n The food is similarly hit and miss - the chunky chips were actually shoestring fries. Not bad in itself but it's annoying to order one thing and receive another. Bread and dips contains a huge loaf of bread, but about 2tbsp of pesto and balsamic to dip it in. We asked for more dips and received another incredibly stingy portion that disappeared in 2 or 3 dunks. The bread had been toasted on the outside, but was still a bit frozen on the inside.\n\n\n Hyde Out has only been open a few weeks, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt for now and put it down to teething problems. It's certainlymy favourite bar in that area at the moment, but then given the competition that's not saying much. Fountainbridge isn't a top spot for passing traffic, so they'll need to improve their act if they want to become a destination bar and survive.\n\n\n Plus their website is awful - again, lots of room for improvement! http://www.hydeout.co.uk/
LLNmo66wO1xoi-yma1HybA	Finally reviewing this place, as after a 4 month wait, following a disastrous afternoon tea experience, the management still haven't had the decency to make good on their offer of a replacement.\nThe tea was bought as an internet deal, promosing a 'luxury afternoon tea'. It was anything but & prompted complaints from a couple sat next to us. \n\nThe waitress was very friendly (the only good thing about the place), but the manager seemed extremely put out by the fact that someone had challenged what they were offering. \n\nIn fact it was the worst meal out, afternoon tea or not, that I've ever had. There was so little of it & even then the quality was poor.\nUpon making an email complaint, I was sent an apologetic (though I see now that it was just sarcastic, as I've tried another 2 times, with another 'manager' there) email offering me a replacement meal, with cocktails. This has never materialised, nor have I been contacted again.\nI could not recommend this place, for food or drinks, as the service is absloutely dreadful. Avoid at all costs.
LLNmo66wO1xoi-yma1HybA	I like the look/decor of this bar, it looks like it could be really cool. It's hidden away so people generally don't know about it. It's close to Cargo which more people would know of as it faces onto a main road. It has the potential to be a great bar but it's lacking something, which I can't quite put my finger on. I've been there twice now and it has been fairly empty each time. I ordered wine and it seemed extremely expensive though I'm not sure what the prices of other drinks were. There's plenty of bars with better atmospheres around this area that I would prefer to go to.\n\nMyself and a friend were going to book the upstairs bar for our birthdays before, but it was going to be very expensive and they wouldn't accept card upstairs so people would have had to go downstairs unless they had cash. I don't know why bars do this.
LLNmo66wO1xoi-yma1HybA	This place is all suits and short skirts, so if that's what you're after it's an alright choice. \n\nMeeting the OH here the other night I was a bit apprehensive as I had always pegged it for a student bar. I was surprised to find a bit of an older crowd (older than undergrads anyway) and the place wasn't too jammed for a Friday night.\n\nA well stocked bar, a decent cocktail menu and a pool table make me think I should make more use of the place but the swirly decals and wacky colour scheme make me think otherwise. \n\nIt's basically a brighter Cargo with less sports on the telly.
LLNmo66wO1xoi-yma1HybA	Had great drinks here the other night. Best thing, it seems, is to ask the staff to make a new drink- they know their stuff, plus they've got a pretty big selection to choose from. Heard someone say it was expensive, but at £6.50 for a decent cocktail on a friday night in a George St-esq place, I can't complain. Such a better alternative to Cargo.
LLNmo66wO1xoi-yma1HybA	hmm this is a rather interesting place.  tucked away behind cargo overlooking the canal basin and office buildings, it's probably not the most popular venue for a night out.  in fact being hidden away i'm not sure that people are totally aware that this place exists which may be a bit of a shame.  the bar is all decked out in dark velvet colours and dark wood tables with stylish wallpaper accents so it's clear that this is trying to mimic the posh bars on george street but somehow it misses the mark.  the space is all modern with windows floor to ceiling on both sides which somehow makes it lack atmosphere when there are so few people having drinks.\n\ni can't say overly much for the service either.  i was at a private party in the upstairs bar and while there was a good number of people i would hardly say that the one girl behind the bar was over run.  that said when i went to order a lime and soda she acted like she was sooooooo busy and this was a waste of her time although i was the only person stood at the bar ordering.  also when my boyfriend tried to pay for a bottle of champange by card he was told he'd have to go downstairs to do this but the girl didn't seem to want to print out the receipt so he could actually pay for the bubbles.  additionally when we had been downstairs earlier in the night (probably around 8pm) to try to order some food we were told that the kitchen was closed and we couldn't.  um what???  we could clearly see into the kitchen and there was a cook there who appeared to be making food... not sure why we were turned down but it was their loss as zizzi got our custom instead.\n\nso overall i wasn't overly impressed with the bar.  it's trying hard but at the same time the staff aren't trying hard at all.  the posh decor should make it a nice place to drink, but it just totally lacked any atmosphere and didn't leave any impression that would make me want to return again.  bit of a shame as with some many financial businesses having their offices nearby this would be an ideal place for an after work drink, but i think with less than friendly bar staff and a cold environment most people will opt for the bars on george street instead.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This is our favourite place to grab breakfast in Montreal and we come back every time we are in Old Montreal. Best latte I've ever had and the food is fantastic. Service is friendly and professional and really fast. Great vibe as well. It gets quite loud in there, but I love some loud and animated conversation to go along with a fabulous meal.\n\nBe ready to wait in line if you go on Saturday or Sunday, but the line moves fairly quickly and I don't mind waiting in line for great food!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Wonderful breakfast!  I enjoyed the goat cheese scrambled eggs on toast.  The eggs were light/fluffy and the goat cheese had a great flavor.  The decor of the restaurant is rustic modern and had a warm feel.  It was also nice that there was free wifi and they serve illy coffee.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Sunday Brunch Spectacular- had Brunch Cartet which was a plate of scrambled egg, salad, cheese, salmon cake (amazing!), and ham croissant. Show stealer: croissant. So good. Not too flaky but not not too solid either, wasn't too salty or too sweet, simply perfect. Probably the best croissant in montreal. I had the ham removed because i don't eat pork so my croissant came just with cream cheese but I'd rather have nothing on it and just go for plain croissant. I cannot stop fawning about how great the texture and softness of the croissant was. Next time I come, I'm simply getting a good ol' croissant avec cafe.\n\nEverything else was great too but honestly the croissant was so good that the rest pales down to it. I also had a latte (they use beans by illy) which was also a rich and smooth blend of milk and coffee, not too bitter. Definitely recommend. All brunch plates also come with bread pudding (not my fav) and (super-duper) fresh orange juice.\n\nBest part is the location, situated south of downtown, in the heart of a non-touristy part old port. It's like walking into a perfect life and having your dreams fulfilled in cup of coffee. Great ambience and had a great experience.\n\nP.s. hot waiters ;)
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Excellent and unique brunch. Good ambience. Lines could be little long but they move it fast. We had the salmon and the ham croissant.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	If there's one thing that I've noticed so far about the Old Port food scene, it's that it tends to be a 50/50 toss up between quality cuisine and overpriced tourist traps. Le Cartet fits more into the first category with a bit of the price factor of the latter. Located in a nice part of the area, it has an open and aesthetically pleasing layout to go along with the food served, a plus that never hurts.\n\nI ordered the "Le Nordique" platter and a maple latte to go along with it. The maple latte, while it didn't have too much of a coffee taste to it, tasted delightful in regards to the quality of the maple flavoring without being overbearingly sweet. The Nordique platter consisted of a smoked salmon Eggs Benedict on a base of some type of black bread, a side salad, and some roasted potatoes. Raw onions garnished the Eggs Benedict, which I picked out since I absolutely detest them, but other than that they it was a really yummy dish. The bread base was also quite amazing and tasted more wholesome than your generic English muffin/white bread. The potatoes were perfectly crisp and seasoned so that they didn't taste bland like how potatoes often become, and the salad had a nice, light dressing to go along with it. The only issue that I had with the dish was that for $15.50, it seemed a bit pricey for how much food they gave, even though it was presented nicely. \n\nLe Cartet is definitely a great place if you want to enjoy a nice brunch in a chic environment. I would save it for occasions that lean more toward the special side, however, unless you have enough dough to spend on a regular basis (which as a university student I do not have, unfortunately).
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Charming breakfast / brunch place in the old port but expensive for what you are getting.\nUsually a wait as well which brings it down on my list of recommendations
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I came here for breakfast/brunch on a Thursday. No line up or crowd which was nice. I ordered the smoked salmon scrambled eggs with black toast and a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice - which btw wasn't squeezed by the restaurant. The food was okay. I think it's a little overrated for what you get and for the price. I don't really get what the hype is all about. I've had better breakfast/brunch elsewhere. On a high note, the vanilla latte was spot on however it would have been nice if they did a little swirly graphic with the milk froth but they didn't. Service was meh.\n\nOverall, I probably wouldn't come back again any time soon. I think there are many other restaurants to try before I return again for my vanilla latte.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Delicious! Love the ambience also. The iced vanilla latte is great. Had the orange juice which was amazing; I wish the glasses were bigger though. Had the brunch santé and it felt health while also tasty.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I was in Montreal for 24hrs with my boyfriend, and while visiting the old city, we decided to have lunch here. \n\nThe street is pretty, with lots of other restaurants, but somehow we picked this one because of its window with all different products and the big common tables you can see from outside. Such a perfect choice! \n\nThe atmosphere is lovely. All waitress and I am assuming the owner are ladies, dress in black, super nice. We ordered their lunch specials of sandwich and soup/salad, which came also with fresh bottle of water (free as well as their refills), and bread with butter. \n\nThe soup was delicious, served inside a tiny pot. My sandwich was amazing, with tons of salmon in it. My boyfriend had a more regular baguette one, but really full of ingredients, with a side of colorful tasty original salad. \n\nWe really enjoyed, and I suggest this gem to everyone who is visiting the old city! Also, free speedy wifi, and cool crowds.\nThank you Le Cartet!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Waiting time is a bit long on this Sunday morning (expected I guess) but the brunch plates are worse it! Fresh orange juice and amazing "latte with maple syrup"!! Must come back and try all the other dishes.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Food & Drink\n- I always get a benedict or poached egg dish for breakfast, brunch here was no different. The eggs were poached perfectly just the way I like them. \n- They don't use hollandaise sauce on the benedict, which I would have preferred, but their sauce was also nice and creamy, but not the taste I'm used to. \n- A side of fruit and potatoes are included - but not much as the benedicts are pretty heavy in themselves. The potatoes are cooked in duck fat and taste divine. \n- The benedict comes with a fresh glass of OJ, I LOVE FRESHLY SQUEEZED OJ!!\n- Latte was good\n\nService\n- The service was great from beginning to end\n- The waiters were very busy, but came by to check on us at all the right times. We never felt rushed.\n- The waiters made sure food and drinks came to use in a timely manner after we ordered.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Ambience is great! It wasn't busy and it felt like a great place to sit and do some work for a couple hours\n\nFood was eh. I got the brunch cartet and while tasty, was more like a bunch of random things thrown on the plate.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This was the very first restaurant I came to upon my arrival in beautiful Montreal. My sister said it was a good breakfast spot and she was right! I ordered a BLT bagel and my sister had the Brunch Sante dish (which came with granola & yogurt, fruit, poaches eggs, cheese, etc.). I really enjoyed this quaint little café; it was cozy, had great service, and a wonderful ambiance that made me feel like I was in a different country... oh wait, I was! Anyway, this was a great place to kick off my vacation and get breakfast. If I lived nearby, I can totally see myself coming here regularly.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Having worked for a year in the Cité Multimédia, Le Cartet was a go-to for lunch time when I had to grab a take-out. I especially love their 'epicerie' style section, where they offer a nice variety of chips and snacks, imported European products (that wasabi mayonnaise I found there, amazing!), and a nice take-out dishes that you could grab and bring back to your office. \n\nThe downside of it? It can get pricey, and it's crowdy since it's sooooo popular during lunchtime.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Le Cartet is one great place to try for breakfast with their interesting concept of boutique restaurant. Plus, they offer a wide range of products such bottled smoothies, sandwiches, salads, pastries and more. \n\nLaid-back crowd, cozy ambiance and delicious food. What can you ask for more? If the weather is great, you can even sit outside. This place definitely get off the beaten track.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Despite there being lots of people waiting, we got a seat outside with the dog within about 5 minutes, both times we went here. The big fry-up was incredible, and the healthy breakfast was delicious. The service was fast and friendly, and they even brought out a bowl of water for the dog.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Came here originally for breakfast but unfortunately it ended by 11am. I got there at 1111am so I had to wait around 10-15 minutes for the kitchen to prepare their brunch/lunch menu. \nI ordered the vegetarian panini with their soup of the day. It was delicious and well presented. \nDefinitely one of my favourite brunch places in Montreal. Located in a lovely area as well. \nStaff are really friendly and hospitable.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This restaurant was great. The food was amazing (a bit expensive, I paid 17$ for the pâtes du jour), but it was delicious. It is located in a beautiful spot, the restaurant and the restrooms are very clean and look quite nice. The service was amazing!!! The waitress was sooooo sweet!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Ce restaurant est classé depuis 3 ans dans le guide mixeur comme étant une des cuisines les plus créatives de Montréal. Pourtant, depuis 3 ans, je lis leur menu et ça ne m'intéresse pas vraiment. \n\nJ'y suis allée au début de la semaine avec 5 amis et j'ai bien aimé. Les sandwichs sont délicieux et savoureux. Chaque pain est servi dans un sandwich qui lui est propre et qu'il est impossible d'interchangé (ce que je trouve un peu dommage. Seule exception: pour du pain sans gluten). Les plats du jour sont simples, mais apparemment délicieux aussi. \n\nLa boutique de produits fins à l'entrée est intéressante, l'ambiance et le décor du restaurant aussi. On retrouve de grandes tables à partager avec des banc en bois ainsi que des petites tables avec des chaises. Les murs sont décorés de façon très artistiques et les petites lampes pendant du très haut plafond apportent beaucoup de cachet. \n\nLe service est gentil, mais peu présent.\n\nAu cartet, on ne révolutionne pas le monde, mais on fait bien les choses. J'y retournerai pour essayer les déjeuners servis tous les jours qui avaient l'air particulièrement cochon.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Great breakfast place with delicious coffees, juices, and breakfast specialties.  Croissants were flakey, hot breakfasts were yummy and service was friendly and fast.  On weekends will require a wait, but there is a charming shop up front with a selection of gourmet items from all over the world.  Nice ambiance with high ceilings and exposed brick walls.   Local crowd.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Pros: Beautiful setting, Delicious& Fresh food, Great service\nCons: Possible wait times, Food baby inducing, Busy\n\n-Ambiance- \nVery nice place to have weekend brunch, a lot of sunshine and open windows perfect to cure that night before hangover.  There is seating outside at the front and inside the restaurant as well as a quaint section selling treats at the front. Our server was phenomenal and was very enthusiastic throughout the whole service; explaining items and catering to all of our particular food needs.  Food ranges from 5-25$.\n\n-Food- \nCoupe Santé:  Yoghurt+ Granola+ Fruits. Ordered this to keep it light and I was very much satisfied. The fruits were fresh and varied,  the granola was in-house made  and still warm, and the yogurt was light and creamy. What more can you ask for. \n\nTrois Minutes: Two soft-boiled eggs with bio toast, duck fat potatoes, fresh fruit and jam.  Straightforward plate with quality ingredients. We also got the organic peanut butter, which was god-sent. \n\n-Overall- \nGo for weekend brunch don't be health conscious pansies like us and get the big brunch plates. Enjoy delicious&fresh food in a beautiful setting with good company.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Went here for breakfast twice during a 2 day stay in Montreal. The food was absolutely fantastic and the ingredients were very fresh. Everything was arranged on the plate with many different components each adding their own flavor and contribution to the overall meal. \n\nI would definitely go to this place again if I happen to find myself in this great city.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Amazing and authentic food served in a really appealing cast iron skillet still sizzling. There was no wait for us and the service was great. I also highly recommend the maple croissants.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I ordered the brunch cartet and my frend ordered brunch sucre. They are really yummy!! The smoothie of the day is great. But we couldn't not finish them. For girls, you can order two brunches for three or even one for two persons :(\n\nBut the environment was too noisy I cannot hear my friend talking
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Had their salmon tartar plate! Nice vibe and little boutique products right at the entrance! :)
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Great ham & cheese baguette though not much for my husband (vegetarian). Excellent selection of chocolate bars inside, and I am regretting that I didn't order a chocolate dessert, they looked amazing!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I had a couple of nice brunches there with friends. Tried the sweet dish and the savory dish, the crusty crunchy toast and de awakening coffee. Will go back there again for its communal seating and of course the food.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Delicious.  Variety.  Well prepared and presented.  From the light to the massive the breakfasts are plenty satisfying.  Love the space too - individual as well as long shared tables and the high ceilings make for a pleasant time.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Again, the yelp posting says its "Good for Kids: Yes" and I disagree slightly.  It's probably good for kids who can sit in their own seat and not in a high chair.  If you have a kid who needs a high chair, I would probably bring your own food for him/her.  The high chair that they brought was a bit disgusting. They obviously do not clean their high chairs every night. We were one of the first when they opened so it's not like tons of other kids used it before we got there.  Also the choices are few and far between for a one year old. There are no waffles, pancakes, or anything of that sort.\n\nWIth that being said, my quiche was tasty and was accompanied by a lovely side salad.  The coconut banana bread was also very yummy, not too sweet and not too coconutty.  My husband ordered the crab extravaganza - crab benedict, crab cakes, and some other crab item.  All were tasty.\n\nOur waiter was a bit stand-offish. I speak french but decided to speak english here and I felt like I paid for it. The waiter was unaccomodating, didn't smile, and ignored us.  We had to wave him down everytime we needed something. It's unfortunate. There was another waiter who stopped by to say hello to my daughter who was very sweet so I don't think all of their staff is half-bad.\n\nI would go back for sure...for the food and when my daughter is older!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Fabulous breakfast/brunch joint. Modern/classy but casual full service cafe/restaurant with small store and takeout near entrance. Gets pretty packed after 10 am weekends. Love the wooden communal tables and the loft style ceilings. Portions are perfect and the coffee is excellent. Great service. Great clean modern décor.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Had a poached egg and duck brunch. \nThe plate was exquisite, service was top notch and the ambiance was excellent. \n\nJust what the doctor ordered. And everyone that works here is a professional. That's quite rare. \n\nTo top it off, the quality you get for the price is probably unique in MTL for breakfast/brunch. \n\nHealthy and more more decadent options are available, the coffee is great and the staff is friendly. \n\nPosted this while still seated. \n\nMust try.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Loved brunch here! Not alot of selection but you sure get the most for your buck!\n\nI got the smoked salmon dish. All was great except for the sweet potato salmon ball. \n\nStaff were very friendly. Would definitely recommend.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Chic, high ceilinged place with a nice looking clientele and excellent food for those who do, and those who do not, like duck fat. They also have very nice take out plates and gift items at the front of the shop.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	As an infrequent visitor of Montreal, Le Cartet is one of my favorite restaurants for breakfast and brunch. Such wonderful food that I think is healthful but doesn't taste like health food.  Despite the bustling flow of people through the place, the staff remains enjoyable.  Love love love this place and wish we had one here in New York!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Breakfast sausage was nearly as dry as salami? Egg had the consistency of egg that's been under a heat lamp for a half-hour.\n\nThe coffee here, and frankly at every restaurant I've visited in Montreal, is like Startbucks' drip on a bad day. Hoping to have better luck at a coffee-centric cafe.\n\nThe only thing good here was the croissant sandwich, which even these guys couldn't get wrong...
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Intéressant concept de resto-boutique. \n\nLes brunchs semblent savoureux, mais les portions sont énormes. Pour éviter de gaspiller la nourriture, j'ai opté pour un des plus petits déjeuners sur le menu, composé de yogourt grec, granola, bleuets et salade de fruits. Pour une dizaine de dollars, je crois que c'était assez décent comme assiette. \n\nToutefois, je ne suis pas particulièrement impressionnée par cette première expérience. Il faut dire que je m'attendais à être absolument sous le charme après avoir lu autant d'éloges au sujet de ce restaurant. \n\nD'une part, je déteste devoir attendre pour déjeuner. Le matin, j'ai faim. Je veux m'asseoir et manger. Tout de suite. Pas attendre une éternité debout avec le ventre qui gargouille à en déranger les gens derrière moi. (Désolée, je deviens rapidement grumpy quand j'ai faim!)\n\nL'ambiance est certes conviviale, mais l'endroit est hyper bruyant. \n\nJe vais peut-être lui donner une seconde chance, mais je ne crois pas ajouter Le Cartet à ma liste de lieux favoris pour bruncher...
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Sometimes life gets too busy or exciting for mundane things like getting groceries or cooking, and you need a neighbourhood go-to place where you can pick up a relatively healthy meal on the run. For me, Le Cartet is that place. I know I can always grab a goat yogurt, a fruit cup, and an Illy coffee for breakfast. For lunch, they have a nice selection of sandwiches and salads. My favourite is a salad with salmon two ways: smoked and flaked with some mayo. The shelves are full of a variety of gourmet items, including enough varieties of fancy chocolate to keep even the most die-hard chocoholic busy for days on end. They also do a pretty killer brunch and a decent sit-down lunch. In summer they have a few tables on the McGill sidewalk.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Came here during lunch with a few friends on a Monday. We were seated quickly but the servers took forever to take our orders and even forgot a part of our order. It wasn't even that busy as it was nearing the end of lunch. \n\nThe pulled pork sandwich was okay. Moist but not very well flavored. The bread was well toasted but bland. The dish was just boring. The salmon tartar was delicious, as was the Bloody Caesar. I was told the gazpacho and chicken sandwich was good. The fish of the day, a white fish, was also bland and dry on the inside.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	AMAZING!  The scrambled eggs and goat chess?  To die for!  Everything was superb, including service. You may wait 20 min for acc table, but holy heck us worth it! ! I you must go!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I'm a big fan of the brunch here! dejeuner santé is yum!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	A lively atmosphere with a great vibe.\nBaked goods as well as some confectionery was sold in front.\nA bright and modern room greets diners on a mixed of private smaller tables and long communal tables.\n\nWe got got lucky and was sat right away.\nThose who came in a few second after us had to wait for around 15 - 30 minutes.\n\nI ordered their signature dish, which was served in a skillet with beans, sausage, bacon, ham, potato and eggs.  I was told this was their most popular dish and had high expectation.  \n\nSadly, I was a bit let down.  While presentation was unique, it was nothing special and quite pricy for what you get at $17.  My companions ordered the crepe and the blueberry french toast - and were very happy with their choices.\n\nService was very professional and efficient.\nI would come again, but order some different next time.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Had the Atlantic brunch plate - it was outstanding... what a great combination of all the ways you could enjoy salmon...  well worth the wait, and have already recommended this to other friends visiting Montreal.  As a frequent brunch diner in NYC, I can honestly say that this place was brilliant, and that many NYC places could learn from Montreal about brunch - especially the skewer of fresh fruit!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I really enjoyed the cappuccino. The food I ordered was really yummy. I liked the blueberry yogurt with granola and fruit.\nOne missing star is because Mr. T. He never likes the scrambled eggs and beans. But his dish had them both.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Outstanding Sunday brunch.  You can't go wrong with anything on the menu.  Delectable meats, farm fresh eggs and garden vegetables.  Friendly service.  Fantastic ambiance.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	If you want to have breakfast in Montreal, you can't go wrong with Le Cartet. Great atmosphere, great food, fast service, even though on a Saturday or Sunday you might have to stand in line. I had to stand in line for about 10 min in +7 weather, but it was worth it. If you look at the pictures I uploaded to Yelp, you'll see that Le Cartet chefs care about presentation and good food. Their yogurt with blueberries and muesli was REALLY tasty. I highly recommend it. Le Cartet is not cheap. You'll pay $17+tax for an average plate, but it's money well spent IMHO. I will surely be back next time I'm in Montreal.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	What a cute and friendly little place!!  I loved the hustle and bustle of the brunch crowd.  The only thing that was a little confusing was getting a seat.  We put in our name on a list and what we do in Chicago is wait outside until they find us.  But you can see there's a queue so after like 20 mins I got in line and bingo! we were seated.  I don't know if it was timing or if we should have been in the line all this time.\nIts a little on the pricey side but one breakfast should be a splurge, right?  We all started w/ mimosas which were great but not for me.  I cannot stand pulp.  I know I'm a weirdo.  I'd rather have Tang than fresh squeezed.  It was too chunky for me but I'm sure everyone else loved it.  I had coffee which was very good.  I got an almond croissant to start/share.  It was amazing!!  We also wanted some cheese so we got the $8 plate which was all good stuff.  I had the goat cheese scramble on toast.  I was so homey and comforting!  They do not skimp on the cheese!  I would have loved more bread but the other diners had extra so no biggie.  They both got this meaty, beany,  cowboy skillet which must have been great.  For a good 10 mins none of us were talking!\nAfter we checked out the little store and bought some candies.  I spent a lot but they were all oh so good and I think...not available in Chicago.\nI'd seek this place out if I were in Montreal again.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	My go-to spot for brunch whenever I visit Montreal. Le Cartet is usually a reasonably short walk (10-15 mins) when I'm staying downtown. The one time I did have to drive here, parking was found easily on one of the side streets nearby. When you enter the restaurant there's a small shop where you can get various coffee grounds, teas, and sandwiches/salads. \n\nI always come rather early, around 8 or 9am (they are open at 7am), so I'm always seated very promptly. There are individual tables for parties of 2/4 and also long communal tables for larger groups. \n\nThe menu is large with lots of sweet and savoury options. I always get the brunch des cantons that comes with bacon, sausage, ham (not the deli kind), beans, and roasted potatoes in duck fat in a cast iron skillet. The ham is my favourite part of the dish because it's very fatty and tender. If you don't eat much in the morning I wouldn't recommend this unless you are going to share it with someone else. \n\nDuring my last visit our entrees were preceded with some sort of milk/egg bread that whetted our appetites for the rich meal that was to come. \n\nThe caffeinated drinks are all delectable. I always get the vanilla latte, coffee, or iced coffee when I'm there in the summer. My friend got a cappuccino last time and got the option of either bowl or cup. \n\nWe left full, energized, and ready to take on the day!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Good brunch spot. We wanted something heavier than a pastry for breakfast so we came here. We both enjoyed our breakfasts and they poach a perfect egg. The only food item that was a bust was the sausage; it was very dry. \n\nI also ordered a cappuccino that never came at the end of my meal.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	My wife and I went to La Caret when we visited Montreal for our anniversary last weekend.\n\nI'm seriously thinking about driving 6 hours back there this weekend just for more breakfast. It's that good.\n\nI was a little nervous about the communal seating - I'm a big dude and not always the most social fellow, so I thought I'd find being packed in next to total strangers to be very uncomfortable. It turned out to be fine. I think the fact that the people on either side of us were speaking French and we were speaking English helped it feel less weird. Plus, I had more room at this communal table than I usually have on the train or even in some restaurants where the "individual" tables are like six inches apart.\n\nThe food was just fantastic. Seriously amazing. \n\nYou know how when you're a kid if you say you love something someone says "If you love it so much, why don't you marry it?" Well I would marry this breakfast skillet, that's how much I love it. Which if the Republicans in my country are to be believed, will be legal about ten minutes after we recognize same sex marriage.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	It was a bit of a walk from the nearest Metro station, but so worth it. So so so delicious. Probably the best meal I had in Montreal.\n\nWe came here for brunch on a Saturday morning, around 10. There were quite a few empty tables, but by the time we left the place was full and there was a line for seating. I ordered the Brunch Toscan. Basically egg's Benedict, with a side of potatoes, assorted fresh fruit, along with some really delicious coffee and freshly squeezed OJ. The egg's Benedict was bomb, and not overly salty and the sauce was rich, but not overpowering. The fresh fruit wasn't the normal crappy fruit you get at most places. Stawberry, grapefruit, orange, and pineapple. Yummy. All that food and drink for 16 bucks, not a bad deal at all. I was stuffed by the end of the meal and like a true brunch, couldn't even think about eating for many hours after. \n\nI also got to eat some of their fresh baguette and croissant. Both were excellent! This is a MUST on every trip to Montreal, and I will definitely be back when I return.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Pretty good place where your not just getting the same old bacon and eggs that 90% of restaurants serve you...\n\nThe menu has lots of interesting items, great presentation, outstanding dishes and kind of like to get my breakfast served in a hot pan lol
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Went to this place for brunch while on a impromptu vacation to Montreal. This place was really awesome and after going to so many bad resturants on this trip, this place hit the spot. My girl got the scrambled eggs with chorizo, I had the blueberry French bread. We can't wait to go back!\n\nMain points\n\nService was really great. Even though it was 10 am and it was kind of busy, our waitress was spot on and really friendly. Food came out quick and the atmosphere was great.\n\nFood was spot on delicious, my French bread was just sweet enough, and I liked the fresh blueberries and cream. My girl really liked the salad that came with her eggs and the potatoes were great.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Coffee was one of the best I have had in Montreal. Service was very attentive and super pleasant. If you love bread, this is the place for you, but if you want much else, you might consider some other place.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I had a delicious lunch here.  The Plat du Jour for $13 was a big portion of perfectly cooked bowtie pasta with a pesto and goat cheese sauce.  A couple of slices of grilled peppers sat on top looking very pretty.  I washed it down with a glass of Illuminati Riparosso for $7.50.  They had a high chair for my friend's baby.  I love the long communal tables but they also have individual tables.  The room is long, narrow and modern in decor but still feels cozy and intimate as the tables are quite close to each other.  I could have spent more time drooling over all the delicious gourmet foods up front that you can buy to go.  I heard that if you buy food you can also buy wine to go.  This would be a perfect spot to pick up your picnic ingredients in Old Montreal.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Waited 40min for this place, definitely definitely worth it!! Once seated, the service was excellent, and the food was delicious. If we hadn't been a bit hungover from being out at Stogies the night before, I would have had a mimosa, they looked awesome. \n\nMy bf had a skillet of eggs, meat, sausage, and potatoes. I had the eggs with Mornay sauce on an English muffin with ham and spinach. I love how their ham and other meats here is actual ham, not that processed slab of crap you get in the States.\n\nThere was some other platter that came with fruit and a croissant that looked awesome that I will get next time I go for sure. \n\nA definite must if you're visiting Montreal.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I wish I found this place the first morning we arrived in Montreal because I would have been there everyday for breakfast. \n\nCons: \n-Pricey for breakfast. There was 3 of us and with one coffee and one breakfast platter each we payed over $90 with tax and tip. \n-Gets crowded fast. We luckily came a little early and didn't wait longer then 10 mins (bonus: outside tables are just first come and taketh- you don't have to wait on the line)\nPros: \n-The most delicious breakfast I have had in a very very very long time. I ordered a salmon bagel plate. It's came with a bagel with lox and cream cheese with onions and these deliciously huge capers. The bagel was thin, crunchy on the outside and nice and fluffy on the inside. It also came with a salmon biscuit (baked salmon and some flour) which was flavorful and not too dry. There was also a side omelet which I just couldn't fit in my stomach. And some fruit and small salad. My boyfriend had a delicious breakfast meat platter with fried beans served on cast iron. Came with some delicious toast too. \n\nI woke up today dreaming about another breakfast like this. It's a most to visit.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Went here for brunch during my stay in Montreal and was very pleased. It had the perfect ambience for a brunch spot and the food was tasty! Prices were reasonable. Got one of the brunch meals and was pleasantly surprised by the portion size. Although it was a bit much for me, it was a wonderful size for my boyfriend. We topped our brunch off with a lovely dessert, a tasty croissant with chocolate inside. Loved it! Also, the mimosa (which was an add on) was nice and potent, just the way I like it.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Just came back from brunch at Le Cartet, unfortunately another high rated restaurant that fell short. I got there just before 10am, the place was bustling with hipsters. Not only is it a restaurant but also a mini market. The place is nice and modern, it also has seating outside. I met two of my colleagues there and we quickly ordered our plates along with 3 mimosas. We waited maybe 10 minutes before our food arrived which was pretty decent considering how busy it was. The plates were nice, combinations were good. The salmon croquette was excellent. The ham croissant was delicious. Mimosa were also pretty fantastic. You might be thinking why am I giving it a 1 star then. Two main reasons:\n\nFirst there was hair in my salad which totally grossed me out.\n\nSecond the response of the waitress Annie when I told her, and I quote "I hope it wasn't curly" then she laughed. Maybe she found that funny but I certainly did not.\n\nWhen the bill arrived she charged me full price. That's not good business. Guess I will have to find another hip brunch place.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I've been to tons of brunch in Toronto and it just doesn't stack up to the ambiance you get in old montreal.  This place gets crazy packed if you go at peak hours but we were lucky enough to walk in and be seated within 5 minutes on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nI had the brunch cartet and was tempted to order more because I was hungry.  Glad I didn't.  You get a massive plate of every item on the breakfast menu and they all include a convenient mimosa option.  Coffee is delicious and not run of the mill big box stuff.  You can buy it by the ounce at the boutique at the front.  Speaking of the boutique, you can find everything there from truffle oil to chocolate spreads to takeout food.... They need to make one of these in Toronto...
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This is a MUST if you are in the area. I got the vanilla latte and the goats milk eggs on toast. Very filling and delicious if you like creamy cheeses. We also had their version of the eggs Benedict which were great. We loved the latte so much compared to other places and chain locations that we went back just for those. Even on a Monday morning the line was out the door so be prepared for a possible wait. They also have a variety of chocolates, coffee beans, and other miscellaneous pre-prepared food items to go.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Not a bad place to stop by for a quick bite to eat. They were moving from Breakfast to Lunch when we got there but no worries they seated us and then we began to wait....for a long time. I understand with the crowds and the mix of some people just talking and other tucking away into their meal. But when we aren't really doing much except waiting for our order to be taken there needs to be some sort of order of things. \n\nThis is more of a friendly socializing place than a place where you get food. The food is alright but it isn't the best it has to offer. With that I'd say this is a sort of quick cafe that turned itself into a brunch place without much room to spare a lunch. In the midst of this chaos there is some room for improvement.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	For their lunch menu, their goat cheese salad is fantastic (if you're into that), but everything else tend to be mediocre and thoroughly overpriced.\n\nTheir brunch menu is solid and have something for everyone.  Each done to par.  Once I had a meat dish where it's basically meat heaven with different types of ham and bacon.  Never seen something like that in brunch before and it was great.  It's worth getting up early for but don't fight the crowd during peak hours.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I found out about this place when reading a 3 year-old NYTimes 36 Hours in Montreal article.  It was near our hotel and gave it a shot.  We arrived at 10am for Sunday brunch and were fortunate that the wait was modest (10min).  When we left, the line was out the door.\n\nFirst, the dining space is very cool.  It is clean, airy, and has a loft like feel.  They really did a good job in optimizing a slightly narrow and long space.  My wife ordered the Brunch Sante and very much enjoyed it.  I got the De L'Atlantique (basically salmon three ways).  Overall, mine was pretty good although I didn't care for the salmon in the sweet potato cake.  Also, I did not think the fruit and salad were fresh.  Finally, in a city with awesome croissants, the one I had from here was easily the worst I've had.  It was stale and uninspired.\n\nDespite some misses with the food, I definitely would come back and would recommend it to others.  The overall experience was very pleasant which was facilitated by the great staff and the vibrant atmosphere.  Plus the free refills on brewed Illy Coffee that comes with the brunch orders (the main initial draw for me) were terrific.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I LOVE the brunch here! I've been coming here every other weekend since moving to Montreal! The service is quick and friendly. The seating is casual, and they have a huge variety of chocolates at the front to purchase! I work nearby so I come here often to grab lunch, or a chocolate snack. The brunch is only served on weekends! I highly recommend it. I would come again and again!\n\nFood -  Amazing!\nService - Friendly and quick\nAmbiance - Casual\nWorth the money - Yes!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	J'ai toujours aimé cet endroit pour le petit-déjeuner. Ambiance relax, joli design et bons plats. Idéal pour une rencontre. \nService sympa.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Wonderful. Food and service are great. Went twice during one 4 day visit. Good portions and despite the crowds we never waited for a table or for our food that long. Tres bien
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Great service! Came on a weekday at 10am and had great service and no line. It wasn't completely packed. They were nice about letting me practice my French too! Got the brunch des canton! It's all the meat cooked on a cast iron. Also got the mimosa. So good!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Get there before 11 or else be prepared to wait.  We got there at around 10:15 and by the time we left there was a long line. Staff was very nice and very observant. Always making sure we were satisfied.  Got the brunch sucre and it was so tasty. A lot of food though so if you're not hungry, you might want to go with something smaller.  My friend had the croissant and he likes it as well.  Also a little pastry shop if you want just a quick bite to munch.  Good food and nice breakfast place. Thumbs up!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Excellent brunch spot featuring both healthy and traditional dishes. \n\nWe really enjoyed our brunch here !
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Food was pretty good. We had the mish mash and le canton. Both satisfying, although one of my potatoes was strangely sour (seems like someone doused it with lemon). Coffee was good too. Waitress was pretty friendly and had a great smile. Parking in the area is kind of tricky
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Very solidly good breakfast, eggs were cooked perfectly. Fast, nice service. They also sell a selection of gourmet foods, jams, chocolate, etc., which was very cool.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This place has such great ambience which makes it more the reason to brunch here when visiting Montreal. The menu has a plethora of dishes consisting of eggs, meats, and salads. They brew illy coffee and just ordering a regular cup with cream sugar does a number. They even let you Togo more coffee if you'd like! If you like fresh squeezed orange juice make sure you order one!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Le Cartet is a great spot for a weekend brunch in Old Montreal. The ambiance is so cheerful and the staff is very friendly. Be sure to order something from the brunch menu. It's a bit more expensive than your typical breakfast place, but the brunch menu includes free coffee and orange juice refills. You also get a little amuse-bouche before your meal. Plus the portion of the food is enormous!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Great stylish brunch spot in the old port. \n\nGood selection of food on the menu and the servings are generous. I had the brunch Cartet, which came with a ham and cheese croissant, salmon cake, salad, fruit skewer, aged cheddar, and a fig. It was so generous that I couldn't finish it, but it was delicious nonetheless. My friends ordered brunch sante and brunch atlantique and everyone was very satisfied with their food. \n\nIf you go for the brunch and mimosa you're looking at about $30 with tip, but given the quality of the food, the service, and the beautiful decor it's worth it. Would definitely go back!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Food was fresh and very good.  Service was so-so.  The waiter forgot to bring my coffee and our meals took a while to get to us.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Rien de tel que d'aller entre amis un dimanche matin (même pluvieux) au Cartet! Hummmm, un vrai petit plaisir! \n\nL'ambiance ressemble à une cantine d'école. C'est convivial! Nous étions placés sur une longue table, à côté d'autres personnes, mais le "plus", c'est que nous n'étions pas collés à nos voisins (pour l'intimité de nos conversations). Parfois, les restaurants ne veulent pas perdre d'espace d'où le fait qu'on puisse être collés aux gens à côté. Cependant, ici même s'il y avait de l'attente à l'entrée, on ne nous a pas placé "collé-serré" avec les personnes à proximité! Point positif pour le Cartet!\n\nAllez, compris je vais vous parler des plats! Je vous sens languir... Et bien, ce fut... dé-li-cieux! Pour le prix, la qualité est là! Quand on prend les brunchs proposés en première place de la liste du menu, nous avons un jus d'orange et une boisson chaude compris dans le kit. Résultat un repas très complet! C'est copieux, mais sans l'être trop non plus. Dose parfaite pour un brunch. Des saveurs mariées à souhait. Des alliances de couleurs pour le plus grand bonheur de nos yeux.\n\nLe service est de qualité tout comme les plats. On ne se sent pas pressés, les serveurs ne se montrent pas stressés ni paniqués par l'attente à la porte. Parfait pour passer un bon moment!\n\nJ'ai demandé à une des serveuses ce que signifiait le nom "Cartet". Elle m'a répondu que c'était un nom propre et non pas un nom commun. Juste pour l'anecdote.\n\nLe cachet du vieux port donne de l'allure à la place en entrant et en sortrant!\n\nI promise you'll have a good time!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	My wife and I were looking for a nice breakfast spot during our recent visit to Montreal.  Thank you Yelpers for recommending Le Cartet!  We liked it so much we went back again the next morning.  I had delicious croissant and toasted baguette with a soft-boiled egg and fruit.  The wife did even better with toasted banana/coconut bread and greek yogurt with fresh blueberries.  (I had that the second day.  Win!)\n\nIt's not so impressive from the street, but inside the decor is lovely - clean and simple.  Service was very friendly.\n\nAfter a week of eating in restaurants full of tourists, it was nice to be in a place favored by the locals.  Most of the clientele had their bags and briefcases and were clearly on their way to work.  Wish I had a place like this near my house!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	We rolled in around 11 for brunch at Le Cartet during a recent vacation and were seated after about a 15-minute wait.  Very tasty; I went with the Brunch des Cantons, which had a ton of meats in a skillet with some eggs and potatoes.  Not earth shattering, but very solid and makes me think I have been getting Canadian bacon all wrong!  Had this with a mimosa on the side and one of their croissants.  I'm not sure I would need to run back here, but my experience was fine and my wife seemed to enjoy herself also.\n\nPicnic table-style seating will turn some people off, so if you want a "private" place to eat, Le Cartet is not your boy.  Our service was great, but at the table next to me, the couple who sat down right as we sat down didn't get their food right away and were just getting their brunches as we were leaving.  I'm not sure if that level of inconsistency is normal, but I saw it first-hand!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Came here for brunch with the hubby for Family day weekend.  There was a line up (as per usual) but thankfully the line was still inside and not in the freezing Montreal cold.  We got a seat after 15 min of waiting and they seated me even though my husband wasn't in line with me yet. \n\nMy husband ordered the brunch des cantons which was a skillet with scrambled eggs, beans and an assortment of meat.  The beans weren't from a can and had a nice sweetness to it.  There was some pork which pretty much melted in your mouth because it was so tender.  The other meats in the skillet were rather lacklustre.  \n\nI ordered the scrambled eggs with cheese and asparagus.  It was warm but not hot - there was a significant difference in temperature between my husband's dish and my own (and yes I know his was in a cast iron skillet but still, food should be hot).  The eggs were cooked well (not overdone) but the lack of seasoning and relatively cool temperature of the dish made it a bit off putting. \n\nI also ordered a smoothie which interestingly wasn't very chilled (I prefer my smoothies nice and cold) but was otherwise quite tasty.  My husband ordered a bowl of latte which had a very milky taste. \n\nOverall, le cartet is good but not great. I don't think I would come back here...if I wanted to wait in line for brunch I think there are better places to go.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	We were visiting Montreal for a week and ended up having breakfast there almost every day. Basically everything on the menu is delicious. We tried the Torta mixta, the eggs with goat cheese, the hazelnut toasts with applesauce and everything was delicious, not to mention their coffee, croissants, duck rillette and bacon. Also a great place to go with kids, because of how fast they are to serve and the service is Excellent! Sure going to miss this place when i go back home!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I can't believe that that little gem had never been mentioned to me. What a pity that all this time I haven't been blessed with the delicious enlightenment that is le Cartet.\n\nTo be honest- I've walked by this space several times and just assumed it was a specialty food shop that was ahem, well out of my price range. Don't be deceived like I was; as it turns out it's an amazing sit-down spot as well. My companion had the country-style breakfast, and while the whole thing looked awesome the most note-worthy thing about it is that the potatoes are cooked in duck fat (DUCK FAT POTATOES PEOPLE.) I ordered the "healthy" breakfast plate, complete with goat cheese toast and poached eggs; a yogurt parfait; as well as figs and cheese. yum.\n\nThe space is exactly what you're hoping for- a cozy and accommodating yet classy spot where even when the place is packed you can hear your brunchin' buddies. I can't wait to bring everyone ever here.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	If you want to do breakfast right look no further than this place. You can keep it simple with a yogurt/granola combo or go all out and get awesome egg dishes, pancakes and so on. Things are lovingly prepared and it is the kind of place that will get you off on the right foot.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I loved this place.  Maybe not everyone will agree.   I've gone here twice during my month stay in Montreal's old city district.  The first time I went I had a tofu salad with quinoa (which was good) and the second time I got a selection of croissant, pudding cake, and petits fours (arachide et choco pistache).   Whereas I find there food to be solidly average but a bit overpriced, I am really impressed by their baked goods which are also quite reasonably priced ($2.00 for a croissant, $5.29 for a bag of petits fours, presumably baked on site) and perfectly delicious.   This place is worth gaining a kilo or two during my vacation :-).\n\nOh! And I should also add they appear to have an extensive chocolate bar selection, both international and quebecois.  I will definitely be going back for those!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Pre-made salads and sandwiches for take-away on pick-up-and-get-back-to-work lunches in the front, and a combo of small two top tables and long communal tables in the back -- Le Cartet appeals to many. I've spent a decent amount of time at Le Cartet. It's a naturally-lit, airy, above street space, where solo business guys on their laptops nestle up next to brunching felines on one side and a young family with a highchair on the other.\n\nService can run at a snail's pace. Attempt to catch the server's eye or get ready to wait a while for an order to be taken or the bill to arrive. \n\nCoffees are fresh, juices are fresher. The ham and eggs breakfast is okay - a couple of pieces of thinly sliced salty ham and eggs scrambled, boiled or poached. But what makes it worth it? The duck fat fried potato wedges. They're a show stopper. I'd come back just for those!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Amazing breakfast! I had the scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and asparagus. Perfectly almost runny eggs on top of country bread. Small portions as the eggs don't cover all the bread. It's about 2 scrambled eggs on top of meant for 3 scrambled eggs. The cheese isn't overwhelming where there is too much or an afterthought where it is put on top after. The duck fat roasted potatoes were rich so don't be alarmed by the fact that there are only 4 halves. You won't eat more than that. The fruit was a nice touch with grapefruit, orange, pineapple and strawberry. My boyfriend had the weekday special of scrambled eggs, beans, ham, bacon, sausage, duck fat roasted potatoes with country bread on the side. The bacon was okay. The sausage was very hard and dry. The ham was however fall of the bone soft and juicy and amazing. Next time I would def do the ham and cheese scrambled eggs.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I read the reviews and really wanted to try this place out. We sat on the patio and have to say that we really enjoyed the meal. The quality of the food was great. I had the Brunch L'atlantique which was a great blend of smoked salmon serviced in a variety of different ways. I enjoyed them all except for the salmon cake which was a variation of the classic crab cake. It was a bit too salty and maybe over-capered  for my taste but overall it was ok. \n\nMy friend had the Brunch Sucre which was crepes, French toast and yoghurt with fruits. He liked his meal (being a real sweet tooth) and the portions were great. \n\nBest value was that fresh squeezed orange juice came with your brunch. \n\nWell worth finding this place and the only thing I'll remember for next time is to make sure to wait and try eating inside. It looked like a great place inside, even though we enjoyed sitting on the patio. It reminded me of places in Europe. \n\nThanks for a great meal.  We'll be back!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This is our long-standing first choice for a brunch with great value. By value, I mean the quality for the price. Yes, there are fancier brunches to be had, but when we're hungry and don't want to take any chances, Le Cartet is it. My husband gets the "des Cantons" brunch and I get the "Sante" brunch. The fresh OJ is much better in the warm months -- it's a bit too tart in the cold months. Usually there's lots of fresh fruit, but they didn't include that when we went in December 2013 -- why? :(. I also like to pick up some chocolate from their huge selection when we check out. We know when to arrive so we don't have to wait in a queue (before 11), and they generally have enough wait staff that service is good. When I worked in downtown Montreal, I often had lunch here or bought a to-go lunch and dessert. We like the spacious high ceilings and the basic decor. One reviewer from TO said it was sooooo passe, but having lived in Montreal for 7 years, and for 30+ years in the US, and some years in TO, I've seen that nothing is more fickle and silly than the Toronto foodie scene. Honestly, any place that would welcome Momofuku like it was the hottest thing ever is plain daft. Anyway, I can testify that Le Cartet has been solid and inviting for at least a decade, and is more inviting since the remodel. I hope it stays that way for another decade. because we'll continue to make it our destination.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Amazing brunch, combinations were delicious, well thought-out as the flavours complimented each other, and eat plate was crafted masterfully. Has the brunch sucre (sweet) and brunch toscan (savoury) and both were perfect, especially to share to satisfy both senses! The brunch sucre was also not overly sweet. Portions didn't seem overwhelming but filling, the food felt very fresh, light and refreshing however.\n\nIt's a tad expensive for brunch, but worth the experience. Service was attentive and bilingual! It's a place that quite packed, so don't be surprised of the wait or needing to sit with other people at a table!\n\nWould recommend to go to in Montreal and easily could go back if I get the chance!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	After trying many of the Montreal breakfast/brunch places, decided to give this place a shot as well due to the good ratings on yelp.  It's close to the bus stop I regularly takes, which makes it super convenient.  A cute joint with very friendly staff.  Open kitchen, open market, grab stuff to go, bakery counter as well as plenty of tables to sit down.  Some of the smaller tables are a bit too close to each other for my taste, but guess it's quite common in Montreal restaurants.  It's almost like eating with your neighbours with 2 inches away from their tables.  \n\nI had the "speculoo latte", which I was very excited to see.  After spending one summer in Belgium, Im totally in love with Speculoo and was very surprised to see they offered it.  Well, I was quite disappointed.  It's more a latte with a lot of cinnamon powders on the top, I didn't taste any speculoo at all or no signs of speculoo anywhere.  \n\nI had the very popular Brunch Atlantic, which is a smoked salmon heaven.  The 1/2 bagel with the smoked salmon was perfectly crispy and right amount of cream cheese.  The salmon scramble was great with very fluffy eggs and bits of smoked salmon.  The salmon cake was unnecessary since it wasn't great.  It's very dry and hard.  It's a pretty bad salmon and potato croquette.  Fresh fruit and salad on the side was refreshing and nice.  And even comes with a juice.  For $19, it seems a bit steep, but with the free juice and the quality overall, it's a pretty good deal. Plus the staff was all very friendly which made the experience even more enjoyable.  \nStopped by the bakery to get some of their almond cakes to go.  The matcha almond cake was to die for.  Perfectly crispy on the outside and moist and nice flavour inside.  Definitely try that if you can.  The chocolate cherry muffin was too sweet for my taste and not a lot of cherries inside.  \n\nOverall, a place that I'd return and I think its'a sold place to go for breakfast/brunches.    \n\nPretty popular place and doesn't take reservations, I'd go early or expect a queue.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Great food but extremely noisy. If you are looking for a quite place for a date or to discuss with someone, it would not be the best place to go, you may have issues to hear the person infront of you
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Excellent déjeuner l'assiette en fonte c très bien présenter une excellente atmosphère très agréable et confortable le serveur très professionnel et souriant
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I enjoyed a nice brunch with some girlfriends here last weekend! We arrived right as the restaurant opened, so we did not have to worry about a line, but there was definitely one once we left.\n\nI had the Brunch de L'Atlantique, which is perfect for those who like smoked salmon. It included half of a Montreal bagel with smoked salmon and all of the fixings, smoked salmon and eggs, a smoked salmon cake, and salad greens. The bagel was delicious (as they always are in Montreal), and I quite liked the crispy flavorful salmon cake. I could have done without the eggs. It was certainly plenty of food for brunch.\n\nThe prices seemed a bit high, but I think worth it for the quantity and quality of food. I recommend!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	If you absolutely want to brunch in old Montreal, this is the right place to go, even with the lineups on weekend. Love the high ceiling, the affordable price and the comfort food & coffee.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Perhaps having had a decent amount of breakfasts, I don't understand the hype about this place. It's not terrible, but at best, it's average (slightly better than average on a few items such as their baked beans, salmon cake, and smoked salmon bagel). The eggs were either too dry or extraordinarily soggy (waterlogged), while the toast consistently came out burnt (almost to a crisp - and not only for us, but also for the patrons around us). Our server didn't seem to notice the char that was supposed to be our toast, in fact, besides taking our order, he didn't speak at all. It was the busboy who inquired if things were okay, and offered to ask the kitchen to change the toast (we declined, as we had finished). The smoothie was quite watered down, and not what you'd expect from a 'supposedly' chic place, although the hot chocolate was not too shabby. Overall, a very average dining experience, much like going to a diner where the servers just take your orders and perhaps offer you coffee refills, not much more.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I came here after reading the good Yelp reviews. It's a pretty solid place, but the long line on weekends for brunch is somewhat off-putting. We figured it must be good if this many people are lining up, so we stuck it out for ~30-45 mins. despite being really hungry! I can't say they manage the line that well. There's a long line and it took me a while to figure out that it was for the coffee/tea counter (you can get a drink to sip on while  you wait). I was confused if it was only a take-out line or not. I stood there for a while, then someone took my name down and added it to a list. We had to awkwardly hang around the boutique section at the front of the restaurant while we waited (mmm, everything there looks so tasty... fancy olive oils, Kusmi teas, pre-made salads...). \n\nI can see why it's popular -- the decor is very understated-chic and the communal tables are nice. Food-wise, I expected more and price-wise, I wouldn't say they offer great value (brunch plates $15-16). I had the brunch Cartet which was huge. I liked that it came with a big salad. The croissant with ham and goat cheese was yummy. The scrambled eggs were kind of cold and the salmon was just ok. My DC's eggs benny looked overcooked; the yolk wasn't drippy like it's supposed to be. \n\nDefinitely get a mimosa though. That's something they do well here and after the long wait, you'll need one.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	If you are looking for a place to brunch in Montreal, look no further. Le Cartet is where it's at! \n\nTheir brunch options are great as you can get an appetizer, main course and mimosa for under $20. There are also lighter options for those who are not as hungry. \n\nI ordered the Trios Minutes which was a boiled egg with 2 whole wheat toasts and fruit. It was great for a light breakfast. My sister ordered the Brunch De L'Atlantique which was a seafood's lover dream. It included 1/2 smoked salmon bagel, scrambled eggs with salmon and a salmon cake. This was served with fruit as well. \n\nLe Cartet also has a baked goods and specialty foods section which is great to pick up something after your meal. I got an almond croissant for a snack on the road back to Toronto. \n\nI will definitely go back when I visit Montreal again.\n\nTIP: Make sure to go early to get a table. It can get quite packed!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Fantastic breakfast. \n\nDidn't look like much from the outside but inside a bustling hive of people having breakfast with people waiting to be seated although because there are so many tables it seemed to turn over quickly. \n\nI had the Brunch Cantons, basically cooked breakfast with the lot bacon, baked beans, ham, potato, scrambled eggs and breakfast sausage. Was very tasty. \n\nService was quick and friendly. I would recommend it to anyone.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	What stood out to me most was the lovely staff. The food is pretty good, but not mind-blowing. I'd still go back though.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Great brunch spot! Their menu is nicely varied. It's a nice change from the typical breakfast place menus.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Great value for quality food. Reasonably priced beer. Long lines.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Bon  endroit  pour  aller   déjeuner  entre  amis  ,  Je    vous  conseille  en  petit  groupe   de  personne  car  les   tables  sont  petites  . Il est  impossible  de  réserver  pour  un   en  fin de  semaine   ,car il ne prennent  pas  de réservation . Ce qui fait  que l'attente  est longue  !!!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	We had breakfast here as a large group and they were excellent at serving us fast! We were in and out, full and ready to head to the airport in under 1 hour! \n\nThe portions are huge, the prices are fair, and food is delicious!! \nI tried the frittata, it was delicious! \nI tried the blueberry French toast! I loved that they used good rustic bread for it, turned out to be an elegant French toast, if that is such a thing! \nI am not a big breakfast person, but I ate noshes here and there from our friends and everyone was really happy!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Come in early or there's going to be a long line for brunch. Great selections of products that lined the walls of the front of the restaurant. I got foie gras in a can and some pate. The pate I got was actually few dollars cheaper than the ones in duty free. There a selection of Italian products, from coffee to truffle oil. We got there around 10:30 on a sunday morning and there's a 20 minute wait, which is not bad. When we left there was a line going all the way outside on a cold windy day.\n\nThe ambience is casual and has a modern cafe feel to it. Noise level is a bit loud, by wouldn't be bothered by it of you're in a group. I recommend small groups to this place. When we ordered the off the brunch menu we have complimentary bread pudding and freshly squeezed orange juice. Staff was really nice and served us pretty fast. Really great service, asked us of we want to split the check considering our group. Food was delicious. Most of us ordered the Maple Latte, really good and smooth. Overall great experience.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I came from San Diego with my friends and sister to this place. It was our first time here and I will be honest, it's such a cozy nice place to eat at. The servers are soo friendly that it's just amazing. Our server was Hedrick and he went above and beyond to make our experience an amazing one. He had a smile on all the time and helped us with such a friendly manner. I definitely recommend this place and next time Im back to Canada I am definitely coming back and recommending it to my other friends.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I just came back from having brunch at Le Cartet. It was, as always, delicious! \n\nCartet is such a great place, it has a modern design with some small single tables and then a couple long communal tables in the back. Sitting at the long table can actually be pretty fun, since chances are you will be seated next to someone that's interesting and looks like they should be a model. (The crowd is usually filled with cool, young urban people.) \n\nIt's pretty busy on the weekends, but the wait is never longer than 20 minutes. The servers are super friendly and very prompt. \n\nThe menu offers a pretty wide variety of choices, my friend is a vegetarian and had plenty of options to choose from. All of the food is fresh and high quality. It's also always masterfully prepared and super tasty. Le Cartet is definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Montreal, and somewhere you have to visit if you're in town.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	The locals love Le Cartet, and you should, too.\n\nBe forewarned: You'd better have an appetite before choosing the 17$ brunch selection, and I suggest you do so. If you have grabbed a bite at the hotel or something beforehand, order something smaller and come back another day, because, straight-up, this is a fantastic place to eat!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Two words. ALMOND CROISSANT.\n\nIt's huge [insert 'that's what she said' joke here] and has a good amount of almond filling. So I would try to split it with someone as a dessert (rather than try to devour the whole thing as breakfast like I did) because it can be a little too heavy for the morning hours.\n\nLe Cartet is a cute cafe with plenty of seating. They sell European snacks/gifts in the front (such as jam, candy, coffee, etc.) You can also get your coffee to go. And it ain't just 'coffee' anymore. So many different varieties to choose from!\n\nService was quick (and they're nice enough to give you their wifi password if you're not from town). \n\nDo yourself a favor and go get that croissant, NOW!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I believe that Daphne M.'s review says it all. This really is a must when you're in town. My visit wouldn't have been complete without it. Indeed, life itself is more complete now that I've been here.\n\nFood: I ordered the hot cast iron thing with meats and beans all around. It was scrumptious! My wife ordered the salmon with baguette because the restaurant didn't get its bagel delivery in the morning, boo! Both were delicious nonetheless. Drink the vanilla latte!\n\nService: extremely friendly and responsive.\n\nDecor: it's tight in here, but everything is extremely clean, especially the restrooms.\n\nTry to get here early because the line can get really long! Park one block over at the public meters and walk briskly (to stay warm).
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Wanted to go here as it was suggested by the Vagabrothers (youtubers) and the food just looked bomb diggity. Had to put in on my "must go eat" list. \n\nWent on a Monday morning for brunch with my hubs and there wasn't too bad a line. On weekends, there will definitely be a lot more people so go on a weekday if possible! Both the hubs + I got the brunch des cantons and coffee. Very delicious food + filling! You are first served an amuse bouche - not sure what it was but I think it was some sort of bread pudding but MANNN, if they sold that on its' own, it would be a best seller! Along with your food, you also get orange juice, free of charge too! Each brunch des cantons cost around $19 so to get the freebies makes the food worth it! \n\nAlso stopped her the day of our departure back home and we picked up a croissant, fruits, and yogurt w/ granola. Delicious but pricy! \n\nOverall, come if you want to enjoy a hip spot along with great food!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Very nice experience. Food was great, as was the service. Bit pricey and fast-paced so thats why 4 stars.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I love this place.  The latte's are amazing and their egg dishes are perfect....  I recommend goat cheese scramble with asparagus.  Wonderful!  Lovely, clean environment as well.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I randomly decided to check out Le Cartet last Saturday morning. It's a pretty bustling place. Lots of people and lots of conversation but it's definitely a spot where I could sip something nice and vibe out to a good book.\n\nI ordered a small cappuccino (because I'm obsessed) and loves every ounce of it. Shortly thereafter, my scrambled eggs with goat cheese showed up. To my surprise, the portion was huge. There was fresh fruit on my plate. And, the smoked salmon that I ordered on the side was perfect (yes capers!). Everything that came out of the kitchen looked great and everyone in the establishment looked to genuinely be pleased. The staff was also super friendly (that always helps!).\n\nHonestly, I was pleasantly surprised by Le Cartet. I will definitely have it firmly on the itinerary the next time I'm in Montreal.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This is by far the most delicious brunch I have ever eaten. What a great place- from decor, to staff to drinks, to food. I am so excited to go back already! My mom and I went there early on a Saturday morning, because I was aware of the lineups later on. We both had the brunch santé! It was so much food- all fresh and delicious! The only thing I would change is to use arugula rather than plain romain lettuce.. But oh my god good good good! This is also the first place in Montreal where I have had excellent coffee... I cannot recommend this restaurant enough!!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Very trendy coffee place on McGill.\nLove to go back With friends- its so beautiful inside !!!\n\nThere is the little shop at the entrane With fine and unique products.\nYou Can even take out prépared meals . they all look good !\nCoffee is de licous\nBreakfast are a sure bet!\nThey have big tables for group.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Perfect breakfast spot.. not far from Old Montreal. My breakfast of scrambled eggs with cheddar cheese and asparagus was light however very filling. The eggs were cooked perfectly. We went during the week so there was no line and the staff was cordial. My husband had the le sucre, which included a raspberry crepe, blueberry brioche French toast with a side of granola and yogurt... which he enjoyed. This place also has non dairy milk alternative with their coffee, soy milk (which most places offer, but I can't stand!), coconut milk( my favorite with coffee) and almond milk.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I went here for brunch with a friend at 12 on a weekday. Although we were disappointed to learn brunch is only on weekends, the lunch menu did not disappoint.\n\nWe started with the soup of the day and a delicious maple latte. For mains we split the duck and scalloped potatoes (potentially the best I've had) and the pulled pork. We finished off with a piece of deliciously moist carrot cake. Every aspect of the meal was exceptional and the restaurant has lovely vibes.\n\nCan't wait to go back for brunch!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	After reading the reviews I expected to be waiting at least an hour! But we got to the restaurant at 10am - minutes from our hotel at nelligan. The wait was about 5 minutes. Very busy, every seat full, but turnover seemed very quick so we were seated promptly!\n\nThey sell mimosa for early morning cures from night prior! I ordered something that sounded like eggs Benny; but they called it something else. The food was all fresh and if I am not mistaken freshly squeezed juice. The service was wonderful!  The food matched the service and ambiance was very high.\n\nHas all the excellent service which was prior provided in Toronto moved to Montreal? What a positive experience, everyone seemed happy but busy. They also have a small store front at the front of the restaurant. When we we're leaving there was a huge lineup. Glad we got there somewhat early!!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Located on a broad yet quiet stretch of McGill near the Old City, Le Cartet looks like jumps straight out of the pages of a travel guide.  It's a big lofty space with crafty art pieces hanging on white brick walls, with lamps hanging down from the ceiling.  Diners are packed close together at small tables or at one of the larger communal ones.  With a small market boutique in the front and the restaurant operation in the back, it practically screams twee, but the food is good and the service is quick.\n\nAfter waiting for 20-30 minutes to sit down, I ordered the Atlantic breakfast platter, while the BF opted for the Sweet.  Both of our plates included coffee (and a mimosa for a few bucks more), as well as an avalanche of food.  My dish included scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, half a bagel dressed with lox, cream cheese, onions, and capers, a mesclun salad, fruit, and a salmon croquette, and it was more than enough.  Everything tasted really good on the whole, although the croquette was a bit dry and crusty.  His dish included crepes, french toast, fruit, and yogurt with granola.  The crepes were very good; not too sweet but just the right amount.  The french toast was not nearly as tender as I normally like (tasted a bit dry), but the subtle addition of the nuts, as well as the applesauce, added a bit of complexity.\n\nThe menu is varied enough without being overwhelming, and the vibe is very mixed.  There are young people, old people, families, couples, and singles.  Considering what we ordered, the prices are pretty reasonable.  My only complaints would be the lack space available for people to wait for tables, as well as eating in.  It also may be a bit noisy if you're trying to carry on a conversation.  But otherwise, this is a perfectly fine brunch spot with good food and a great atmosphere/scene.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	The food there is amazing and they have something new as daily special everyday. I had their pasta special for lunch today.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Went here for an early lunch. I thought it was quite good. My bf and I ordered sandwiches - grilled chicken and a roast beef. The grilled chicken was better than the roast beef. The real star of the meal was the carrot salad. It had this unexpected ginger flavor with some dried cranberries.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This place is LEGIT for brunch.\n\nMe and 3 buddies were in town for the weekend and decided to try the food on a saturday morning. The wait was too long for inside and luckily seats were opening outside which was perfect as the weather reflected our luck. \n\nThe staff were amazing, very friendly, and very helpful. But the food was the highlight here, it was insane! The portions were really big and perfect to fill our very hungry bellies. The food was really outstanding, all of our dishes were incredible, I wish this place existed for us back home.\n\nIf i'm ever back in Montreal I will surely be here for sure.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Situated in Old Montréal, Le Cartet offers healthy yet gourmet European style breakfast at moderate pricing.\n\nFor coffee, the restaurant uses Illy espresso, a great coffee with its roots in Italy, and my breakfast tea was from Paris, from the brand Kusmi Tea. What I found interesting and thoughtful was that the milk for my tea was frothed!\n\nThe restaurant opens at 7am and serves their breakfast until 11am. We arrived at 7:30am, and by 8 o'clock, we were very surprised to see the restaurant fully packed with a line forming at the front waiting for tables! Our advice to you is to arrive before 8am and beat the morning rush. The restaurant offers a great vibe in their loft-like space, and is a great place to bond with your colleagues or friends. If you're looking for a quick coffee, the restaurant has an open coffee bar at the front which operates much like a café to get your caffeine fix. They also have a great selection of pre-packaged foods for a quick lunch midday, ranging from salads, yogurt bowls, pasta, and much more.\n\nI had Le Brunch Sucre. Because of its name, I expected most of my breakfast to be very sweet. To my surprise, most of the foods were sweet, but very balanced. For example, the raspberry jam on my crepe was more acidic than sweet. This is probably because they didn't add as much sugar than your generic jam company does, which provided a much refreshing taste when eaten together with the maple syrup.\n\nThe yogurt and their granola also blew me away. The granola was tasted nothing different at the beginning, but as I kept eating it with the yogurt, I found myself tasting the ginger more gradually and realized that I didn't really need the honey to sweeten it. This means a lot, from someone that loves their things, especially yogurt, sweet! The yogurt was great; it seemed very fresh, thick, and dense in consistency. It balanced everything else in the bowl very well. I saw many women ordering the yogurt bowl as part of their breakfasts, and I agree, it's a great way to start your morning!\n\nThe butter and maple syrup that the restaurant provided was quite different from the typical store-bought (or mass produced) goods as well. The butter tasted amazing, and was very light and fluffy in texture - not the hard and dense kind you see most of the time. The apple butter on the french toast was my favourite, and had to really hold myself back from buying a jar of it on my way out. It really was a perfect pairing with the french toast, and a great alternative to having your typical syrup and butter on it.\n\nOverall, I really recommend this breakfast to anyone that's looking for a sweet yet healthy option. The restaurant offers breakfast every weekday from 7am-11am, and also offers a weekend brunch both Saturday and Sunday from 9am to 3:30pm.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Le Cartet a été un de nos premiers arrêts lors d'une visite guidée pour des invités venant de l'Autsralie. Nous y sommes allé pour le brunch et en sommes resortis rassasiés et satisfaits.\n\nJ'étais avec trois gars qui ont tous pris le Brunch des cantons, Un délice pour ceux qui aiment la viande, et une occasion parfaite découvrir les cretons et fèves aux lards à des étrangers.\n\nPour ma part, le brouillé aux asperges et cheddar servi sur une toast géante était très bien. Les fruits en accompagnement étaient aussi très bon, et non de simples garnitures pour rendre l'assiette jolie.\n\nJ'y retourne c'est granati.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Le Cartet has turned me on to the deliciousness that is goat cheese in scrambled eggs, and I will be forever grateful.\n\nMy boyfriend and I decided to brunch at Le Cartet when we visited Montreal, and I really have to credit Yelp with getting us to check out this cozy spot.\n\nWhen you first arrive, you walk through the small specialty foods area. Chocolate bars of all sorts line the wall just beyond the entrance, and other fun food finds (like maple syrup, coffee and olive oil) are to your left. Looking around is a fun distraction while waiting for your table to be called, which for us took about 15 minutes. \n\nWe were seated along a long table, hip-to-hip with other diners, but that didn't bother us. I ordered the aforementioned scrambled eggs with goat cheese, which came on bread and also came with potatoes roasted in duck fat and fruit. I ordered a bagel with cream cheese, so I can could try the Montreal bagels I had heard so much about. \n\nAnd again, these eggs! Just do it! \n\nMy boyfriend got the Brunch de L'Atlantique, which includes a ramekin of scrambled eggs with smoked salmon, half of a smoked salmon bagel, a salmon and sweet potato cake, salad and fruit. Now this is a pretty breakfast! I liked the cake the best. It was very similar to a crab cake. \n\nAnd as if all of this food wasn't enough, we enjoyed mimosas and an amuse-bouche that reminded me of coffee cake. \n\nThe servers seemed experienced with getting diners through quickly -- a must considering how popular this place seems to be -- but our server was very attentive and polite at the same time. He went through the menu with us in English, and answered each question we had. \n\nHappily full after our meal, we then took more time to peruse the specialty food offerings and bought quite a few items to bring home to give to loved ones as souvenirs. Getting a great meal and some shopping done at the same time was such a nice benefit, especially considering we had only a few days to spend in this glorious city. One-stop shopping at its finest!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	My family and I went on a Monday morning, and it wasn't overwhelmingly busy. Had a cool edgy but modern feel. Everything on the menu seemed appetizing (making my decision quite difficult) but I ended up getting the eggs with goat milk cheese and loved it.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This is one of my favorite brunch spots in Montreal, been here many times.\n\nFood: very good. Highly recommend the brunch sante. The coffee is fantastic as well, can't go wrong with most of the brunch options. Portions are just the right size and come with orange juice.\n\nService: fast and timely, staff is also very kind. Don't go too late or you'll wait a while in line, it starts getting very busy after 10.\n\nPrice: reasonable, expect around 25/pp with coffee. Worth it for the quality of food.\n\nAmbiance: hipster vibes. There are both communal tables and non communal tables, and a very cute shop in front for taking things to go.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Salle agréable, service agréable, lunch agréable, prix corrects. Quatre facteurs gagnants pour y revenir manger une soupe-sandwich le midi et peut-être un plat la prochaine fois.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Pendant des années, je travaillais dans le coin et, pendant des années, j'y ai mangé leurs repas et sandwichs prêts-à-manger sur l'heure du lunch. C'était aussi, d'ailleurs, mon café de facto en rentrant au travail le matin. Sans flincher, c'est probablement un des restos les plus fiables. La qualité de leurs produits est toujours des plus élevées, l'accueil en restaurant et au comptoir est toujours à la hauteur et les prix sont quand même abordables pour le Vieux-Montréal. \n\nBonnes salades, excellents sandwichs sur pain au levain maison, délicieux plats chauds pour emporter, excellente variété de boissons et superbe sélection de sucreries et chocolats locaux.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Lately le Cartet has become my regular breakfast spot. I enjoy the communal table seating and the interesting art found on the walls.\n\nThe food isn't half bad either, the atlantique brunch and the soft boiled eggs are my favorite toped off with a cafe au lait in a bowl. Everything at le Cartet is good I've never heard anyone complain about the food.\n\nThe service on the other hand can be hit or miss, if one of the waiters friends happens to drop in for a coffee you could find yourself waiting for them to finish the conversation before they come take your order. \n\nAll in all Le Cartet is very nice place with good food and OK service, just remember this is old Montreal so the prices are old Montreal prices a little expensive.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This lunch spot in Old Montreal looks quite unassuming from the street facade. However, the inside is quite spacious with a pleasing decor. The crowd is a mix of workers clad in business suit and trendy yuppies with plastic rimmed glasses.\n\nThe front of the restaurant also has a nice selection of takeouts, including some gourmet canned food like "Duck smoked meat". Please remember that as a great alternative the next time you have an urge to buy a "5 Dollar Foot Long" for dinner :P  \n\nThe food was quite good although I was a bit disappointed with the small size of my sandwich. My friend had the dish of the day (lamb rack served with polenta and veggies). Quite good and a good value according to him. The dessert made up for it. I tried both the Praline chocolate mousse and the Pecan pie: both delicious!\n\nit won't be my everyday lunch spot but worth a try. Expect to pay a little bit more. It's however expected considering the location.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	My sister and I really enjoyed Cartet in April.  If the day is nice and the wait is long, get prepared items from the shop section and picnic.  We waited just long enough for me to buy blueberry chocolate spread from the shop (AMAZING).  Brunch menu is extensive, and we both ordered huge plates with a little bit of everything.  Sister--Brunch de L'Atlantique: Eggs with smoked salmon, half a bagel with all the typical accoutrements, greens, a little sweet potato and salmon cake, and fruit. Me: Brunch de Sante--yogurt with granola and blueberries, poached eggs on greens, and grilled bread, cheddar sticks, and a fig.  And it came with coffee and juice, all for $15.  This is the kind of plate I would dream up for myself at home.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	My family and I walked to Le Cartet from our hotel in downtown Montreal and it was a fun experience. The space is much bigger than it appears at first with smaller tables and also family style tables. They were friendly and patient with the two year old in our group, too. The coffee was hot and rich, as was our food. \n\nThe staff couldn't have been friendlier.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	The 2 stars are for the rustic decoration. I have been to at least 80% of the brunch places in Montreal. I always thought that the old port was overrated and mostly a tourist trap but who am I to refuse a new brunch experience. I should have. It was very disappointing. \n1. The food was burnt and served cold. I still tried to eat it but then gave up since the potatoes and beans were dry, the bacon was stuck to the hot plate. \n2. Service was terrible. two times we had to ask for food items that were missing on our plates. Like bread and jam which is basic. No fruit salad. and no "mise-en-bouche". To top it off, when the waitress finally arrived 30 min with those items, she only brought 1 portion. at that point I was done arguing. \nI can take bad service, good food and vice versa but BOTH? no way. That was my first and last time at Cartet.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Went there for brunch with friends on Saturday. I ordered the Brunch Toscan and I have never had such a stale english muffin before. The bottom was so stale that it was difficult to cut. I was super hungry, and I've used a saw before so I managed. But it was unpleasant and didn't taste very good.\n\nI left some behind to show to the waiter who seemed to just shrug it off like who cares. Super bizzare. Even McDonalds would have apologized or something. Definitely odd to have such poor quality control.\n\nHowever my friends ordered different stuff and seemed to enjoy it. So maybe some things are good here.\n\nOh and the amuse bouche to start was great, so some points for that.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	The salmon sandwich was a little too fishy, but the spicy chicken panini was excellent. Very cute,  minimalistic decor. Really enjoyed our overall experience. Staff is friendly and quick. Nice place for a quick lunch.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I LOVE this place. Every time I visit Montreal this is a must. I also hope that it never changes. For me, this is the perfect breakfast spot. Even if there is a line, it's worth it! Everything I've ever tried has been amazing. I'm fond of the savory skillet dishes (with a free orange juice and fresh bread), but also a big fan of the crepes. It's good if you go with multiple (that was you can share!). Go hungry, leave extremely satisfied.\n\nOn the way out, don't forget to stop at the store and get some goodies to go. I opted for the Dolfin Lavender Chocolate bar. YUM!\n\nPlease open a branch in Brooklyn, NY. Pretty please?
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Located in old Montreal, long lineup, great atmosphere, small boutique for gourmet chocolates and teas. If you're looking for big dishes with greasy bacon and sausages, this is probably not the place for you. This resto is similar to Parisian bakeries, the croissant, baguettes and confitures- my kind of establishment. I got the brunch santé and my yogurt was soooo good, creamier French style yogurt, love it. The artisanal breads were good and overall this place is a winner for me, I like simple breakfast with great coffee.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Je reviens du Cartet suite à une rencontre professionnelle. J'y ai été suite à une suggestion de plusieurs amies. Et je n'ai pas été déçue! \n\nLe décor est très à la mode et a un look professionnel. Ça reste tout de même très chaleureux avec un excellent service à la clientèle et ses petites ardoises qui annoncent le menu. \n\nDe plus, il est à 5 minutes du métro Square Victoria et c'est très facile de s'y rendre en descendant la rue McGill. \n\nJe n'y suis pas rester longtemps et j'ai bu seulement un petit café au lait, mais c'était exactement ce que j'avais de besoin. Ça mérite un beau gros 4!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	After reading the reviews on yelp, I walked the mile here from my hotel.  I had had a late morning and was open to eating either breakfast or lunch when I arrived.  I walked in the door at 11:15 on a Thursday.  The place was almost empty.  I sat down and the server told me that they had just ended breakfast and that they wouldn't be starting lunch for another 20 minutes.\n\nI ended up getting food to go rather than wait 20 minutes for no reason.\n\nIt's unfortunate that for some reason they can't find a way to continue to serve between meals when...well...they're a restaurant and I'm one person.\n\nThe food I got to go was decent.  So the lesson of the day is...don't walk here at 11:15.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	The service was good, but the food was not worth what they charge you IMO. $18+ for undercooked bacon (even though it's served on a hot cast iron skillet), hard beans, dry toast- ehhhh. The ham and sausage were good though and the complimentary bread pudding to start is nice.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I need to update my rating to a five. We have been so many times now and Le Cartet is consistently awesome. Family favourite.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	My fiance and I made Le Cartet our first grub stop after we arrived in Montreal, starving from our long drive from New York.  The line was literally out the door, with pedestrians struggling to make their way through because hungry folks in line were blocking the wide sidewalk.  Well, despite our hunger, we figured a long line is a good sign, so we waited about 20-30 minutes to get in.\n\nWe were directed by a friendly staff into the loooooong restaurant.  The long dining tables, which I would unhesitatingly put into my own dining room, were very fitting given the restaurant's length.  Me like!  So we started off with 2 cappucinos.  I ordered the bowl after being informed of the size of the cup, and my fiance ordered the cup.  Yes, I eat like a fat person and it's quite embarrassing when my male partner's portions are smaller than my own.  Anywho, the cappucinos were creamy, frothy and smooth ... a great start to our brunch!\n\nI decided to go with the Brunch de L'Atlantique and my fiance went with Brunch des Cantons.  I love salmon so this was the perfect dish for me.  It featured a potato and salmon cake, smoked salmon over bagel and eggs with salmon, sided with salad and fruits.  My fiance's didn't appeal to me too much because I was so absorbed with my salmony meal, but his dish was by far more savory, with sausages, eggs and ham.  Both dishes came with a glass of orange juice, which really filled us up.  I left nothing but crumbs on my plate and left with a happy tummy.  Definitely worth the wait!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	We stopped here for brunch on the way out of a weekend in Montreal, and were blown away by the food.  I had the Brunch Sante, which featured poached eggs over shredded greens, herbed chevre and multi-grain toast. It also came with ginger granola and blueberryies over a yogurt that had the consistency of creme fraiche, some fresh fruit, aged cheddar, and a fig.\n\nMy wife had a Brunch Sucre, which included crepes, with blueberry and candied orange peel, toast topped with homemade apple-puree (almost half-way between applesauce and apple butter), and the yogurt/granola combo.  \n\nBoth brunches came to about $15 each, and included drip coffee (delicious) and orange juice.  In addition, the space is beautiful, with excellent use of wood, metal and air to provide an open environment.  \n\nWe were in a bit of a hurry, and though we never mentioned it, the food came promptly and our server was attentive.  If we hadn't been leaving the city, we would have definitely availed ourselves of the market in front, too.\n\nIf you're visiting Montreal for a weekend, it's totally worth a stop.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Always enjoy going there for brunch. Expect to wait in line! but it does move.. \nWe ordered the Brunch Sante and Brunch Sucre. Never again! I had the Brunch Sucre, it was sugar over load.... in sweetness and in volume.  I do recommend sharing this plate! the wild blueberries are fantastic and the cream is not too thick. The crepes are are very good and quite dense, you may want to take a walk in the old port after. The Brunch sente was more reasonable. The granola yogurt is think and really good. I added some maple syrup to it as well .  I still have a hard time getting use to paying for a regular coffee when almost every other brunch place it's included! it's not like the price of the plate is not allowing for a free coffee :)  However they do include orange juice (still would rather the coffee).
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	My second best brunch ever! We ordered two full plates and were not disappointed at all. I absolutely loved the poached eggs, done to perfection. Their signature granola with a 10% fat yogurt and honey was to die for! Fresh fruit and good cappuccino to top it all off.\n\nThank you to a friend who suggested this place! Highly recommended if you're in old Montreal.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Came here for brunch one time.  \n\nInteresting setup here.  It's a mini-store that also serve as a restaurant.  \n\nThey have communal tables in the back where you can share with other people.  \n\nPretty wide selection for brunch, good portion, orange juice was great.\n\nPros - There was a lot of good looking boys at brunch that we stared at! :)
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	My favourite workday lunch!  I've been here maybe a dozen times and have enjoyed every meal I've ordered so far from breakfast to lunch.   Not a big pasta fan but when I had one of their pasta dishes, I was impressed with how much I enjoyed their al dente pasta!   Pick anyone! Their soups are also good. \n\nThe staff have always been very courteous and pleasant, which is a big thing.\n\nThe reason I can't give them 5 stars is that every single time I eat there, there's always at least 1 pesky small black fly buzzing around!! It's small so not too crazy but definitely annoying to have to swat it away.  Other than that, I love the ambiance inside. It's bright and well lit, not overly noisy to allow lunch conversation.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Been meaning to try this place for brunch for over a year now but never really wanted to brave the cold weather during the 20+ min wait outside.\nI finally mustered enough courage to go and boy oh boy was it worth it!\nWe shared the Brunch cantons and the Brunch sucré. The beans were just divine! One tiny suggestion for the crepes on the brunch sucré plate: I recommend putting that delicious candied Orange rind and raspberry sauce in the crepe as well. They only smear some on top of it and it's simply not enough! \nTry the Moka noir orange. Best coffee I've ever had. \nLastly, Stephani the waitress was amazing. In a great mood. :) made our brunch all the more better.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	We ate here twice on a recent long weekend in Montreal. I love the food and the atmosphere. My wife found her crepes (Sunday brunch) were a little heavy. My eggs with the Mornay sauce were heavenly and came with fresh squeezed orange juice! The wait staff were also superb. Highly recommend for breakfast and brunch.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	* Nice physical spot, ok brunch *\n\nThe physical layout of this spot is really nice.  It is a long narrow space with painted brick walls and wooden tables, along with about 8 sidewalk tables.  There is also a small food market towards the front, which had a very nice selection of chocolate and some local products like smoked duck in a can, etc.  \n\nI had brunch at one of the sidewalk tables.  \n\nThe brunch included:\n\n- A sweet bread (not sweetbreads, but a cake like bread, which we were never served although saw all of the other tables getting)\n- A smoked salmon egg scramble, where the whites and yolks were not fully incorporated to each other\n- Half a bagel with cream cheese, smoked salmon, and capers (tasty local bagel with nice quality salmon)\n- A sweet potato and salmon cake (was a bit cold and crumbled apart but had nice salmon flavour)\n- A green salad (which was good, but slightly overdressed)\n- Some cut fruit (fine)\n- A glass of orange juice (unfortunately not fresh squeezed)\n- Coffee or tea (I had a nice quality tea, although the water was not as hot as it should be)\n\nThe sidewalk tables suffer from the attack of many bees.  The two women at the next table had a constant battle (probably their strong perfume was saving our table a bit from the onslaught - but we had our fair share as well over the course of the meal).  My side tip - open some of the confiture packs and place them away from your table to attract the bees away - it seems to basically work!  \n\nOverall the brunch was ok, but nothing I would rush back for.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I've come here alot for lunch. Eaten here and bought meals from their 'grocery' section. They're really..... Hit or miss sometimes. I'd say 80% of the time, their meal of the day is a hit... But you don't really know what the meal will be ahead of time and sometimes the meal itself might not be your thing. Their duck confit with side of salad has been 60% hit, 40% miss. When it misses, it feels like the duck is old. I don't know how else to describe it. Their sandwiches are usually good but when they're not, it's probably because the inside is still cold and you realize they probably just half heated it up when they took it from the grocery section. The foods from their grocery section I've enjoyed but check the packaged date. I would try to go for items packaged today or yesterday. Their cookies are delicious. Even if they're 4$ a pop.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Superbe expérience de brunch style familial! Nous sommes arrivés au bon moment, puisqu'il y avait aucune file (ce qui n'était pas le cas vers 10h30-11h). \nNous avons pris le Brunch Santé, Brunch des Cantons et Brunch Cartet. Ils étaient tous délicieux et remplissants! L'ambience était chaleureuse et accueillante. Notre serveuse était présente (sans être tannante, si vous voyez ce que je veux dire) et nous a offert de bons conseils. \nÀ essayer si vous êtes dans les environs du Vieux-Montréal!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	It's okay. A little hyped up. The food is average. They're not very accommodating for me the vegetarian, they don't make any alterations and my husband the meat eater wasn't overly impressed either. Frankly the service is lacking with disinterested staff, been on multiple occasions just to see what the fuss is about in case we caught them on an off day but never left happy.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	We ordered the omelet with asparagus, granola and yogurt and coconut toast.  Everything was ok and little.  Actually, just enough for us since we ate too much during the entire trip so we were ready to scale back but if you are hungry, you will need to order more than this.  Also, the coffee here is great.  It wasn't espresso but was full flavor taste and they did refill my cup.  Our waiter looked very annoyed (maybe since we spoke English) but he wasn't going out of his way to be helpful.  We were at a community table and sat next to a couple of guys discussing their powerpoint presentation for a sale or something so you need to accommodate if you are a party of greater than 2.  They had many tables set up for parties of two.  Also, the pastries weren't as good as Olive and Gourmand.  There are other places that are better to try.  Parking was easy since they are located on the less crowded part of McGill Rue.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Location: Tucked away in the Old Port. The closest subway is Square Victoria, street parking is available but good luck with that. If you're downtown, it's an easy walk so you can skip transit if you want to get some cardio in.\n\nThe place: Le Cartet is not excessively big but the layout is good, with simple decor and a pretty plentiful boutique at the front. There's usually a line-up on weekends so you'll want to plan accordingly. We arrived around 10:45 and had to wait, but only for about 15-20 minutes. \n\nThe goods: I went for the 2 eggs with goat cheese on toast, with a side of potatoes (like, about 4 of them). Can't say one bad thing about this simple but tasty breakfast. The eggs were perfectly scrambled and fluffy and had the right amount of cheese, the bread was fantastic (a multigrain, I think) and the potatoes were good. They also know how to make a mean Macchiato, which always makes me happy since many places do not. Quality goods, all around.\n\nService: The service was good, though the waiter couldn't seem to get our bills right. He had to reprint them twice, and both times, they were wrong.   \n\nPrice point: I forget the exact amount, but it was on par with other breakfast places in town. \n\nTheir storefront boutique offers a ton of stuff - so if you're in the area and want to grab something real quick, stop in!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Cute place. Solid breakfast. Staples, nothing too fancy. The staff is nice, and the little shop in the front is a nice place to pick up some French food-based gifts. \n\nMy favorite part was the espresso & the great chocolate-pistachio croissant!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	We visited from the States.  Got up late but they were still serving quiche.  Best. Quiche. Ever.  Damn....and the mimosas!!!!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I came here with my best friend for brunch after seeing all the awesome reviews on Yelp! We arrived about 40 minutes after they opened and there was already a very short line (2 groups of people in front of us)! \n\nWhat I love about Le Cartet is the relaxing and casual vibe that it gives off. The interior is very modern and "hip", and the servers are  laid back. A downside is that everything is very crammed; so be careful when you walk around.\n\nOrdered maple latte (cannot live with caffeine) which was SOO GOOD. I don't think I've ever had such an amazing cup of latte. It was strong enough to keep me awake, but not too strong to mask the maple aftertaste. \n\nI got the salmon cake after taking my sweet time to decide. There are a lot of choices on the menu!!! Maybe Yelp hyped it up too much? But I was slightly disappointed in the salmon cake and my food in general. There is no doubt that it was tasty and filling, but will I go back to this exact spot again for brunch? Probably not.\n\nThey also sell food and snacks in front of the store so you can hang around whether you're waiting in line, or about to leave.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	If you are visiting Montreal, staying in Old City and want a great breakfast, this place is a MUST!!! My wife and I are Americans and used to big breakfast plates and we were not disappointed. They do a superb job at putting a unique French spin on breakfast. Their customer service is genuine (we went twice with different servers) and fast and the food is AMAZING!!! I enjoyed their salmon breakfast plate and their version of eggs Benedict. You will love it!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Hubby & I came here for weekend brunch. Had the Toasta Mixta and Blueberry French Bread. Very fresh & tasty! Also had a mimosa which was so good. \n\nBe prepared, there does tend to be a wait and not all tables are private/separate seating. The second time we came, we got seated in the middle of a long table, with different groups on either end.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Cool little spot in Old Montreal area with good service and beautiful, minimalist modern decor.  Pre-packaged foods available at the front for quick lunch or picnics.  However, sit down for breakfast/brunch had limited menu and relatively high prices.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	We wondered here on a Sunday AM for brunch and the line was out the door! I think we ended up waiting around 30 min so I guess it wasn't too bad. I really dislike their system of waiting in line... Can't we put down our name and number and have the restaurant call us? That way we're not stuck standing and waiting!\n\nOnce inside, there are large communal tables, but we were lucky enough to get one for two. I had their smoothie of the day to start and it was so refreshing! I liked how it just tasted like a mix of all sorts of fruits blended with light ice. For my meal I had the Brunch Toscan. The eggs were cooked nicely and the dish was very filling. I wouldn't say this was the best thing I've ever eaten, but it was decent. \n\nThe reason why I'm giving it so many stars is thanks the whole ambiance of the place! There's also a little market in the front where you can buy pre packaged foods to go as well as different snacks. It's such a cute place!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	place is cool. looks beautiful\nservice is great. but..not such a fan of the food. maybe it s me but i think it s not elaborated enough. but the overall is statisfying.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	We were visiting Old Montreal for the weekend and wanted to try some coffee. While walking around, we stumbled on this gem. I'm glad we went while we did because there was a huge line that would have taken a while. We decided to just get coffee to go (so we went to the left check out instead of the line on the right side). \n\nCoffee you can't go wrong. I got the cappuccino while my friend got the pumpkin spice latte. It was (in my opinion) pretty good, but my friend did not think her pumpkin spice latte was sweet enough.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Was on vacay and it was so good we are here twice! \nThe little shop in the restaurant has amazing treats including gluten free baked goods. \nBreakfast was incredible with gluten free choices and delicious coffee.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I had a great Sunday breakfast/brunch here. I ate the Brunch des Cantons which is eggs, country ham, bacon, sausage, baked beans and potatoes served in a cast iron skillet. It was definitely hearty but exactly what I needed after a late night and every component of the dish tasted awesome. Turns out it was the only meal I needed for the entire day.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Based on some reviews, we decided to head here for a quick lunch on our way out of Montreal.\n\nWalking in I was completely amazed by the unsuspecting interiors of the place.  We stumbled upon this place around lunch time, so the joint was packed with the buzz of hungry people.\n\nThe food selection was impressive and the service quite friendly considering how busy the place was.\n\nThe only problem arose from there only being two servers for the entire lunch rush, which led to longer than ideal wait times for our food and bill.\n\nAfterwards, we picked up a few items from their great take out selection and headed on our way.\n\nAll in all, the experience was quite positive: the food and the atmosphere were fantastic despite the service being a bit slow.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This place was great! Authentic, fresh, cozy, tasty! Close to downtown and the Old City. Just fabulous brunch!!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I won't lie the 2 of us considered other brunch options when we walked in at about 11am on a Sunday morning - there were dozens of people waiting to be seated! However, the server quickly took our name and we only waited about 15mins to be seated. \n\nOur wait gave us time to peruse the grocery store section - the shelves were filled with a plethora of goodies; olive oils, chocolates, gourmet pastas, preserves.... made me wish I was a better cook!\n\nWe loved the restaurant with its open kitchen, high ceiling and bright airy feel. The little decor details, fall flowers and mini pumpkins, were a nice touch. \n\nWe were seated at the communal tables - you have just enough space to eat comfortably and its great if you enjoy a little eavesdropping like I do!\n\nMenu isn't extensive but well thought out - there's bound to be a choice for you whether you're feeling "sucré, salé or santé"\n\nTheir specials (all about $15) come with coffee and juice (or a mimosa for a little extra!)\n\nRather than bread, they brought us a few pieces of apple cake to start - delicious and a nice detail. \n\nI had the Brunch des Cantons - their version of the big breakfast - served in a cast iron pan. It had ham, sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, beans, and potatoes, as well as a side plate of bread and fruit.  It was good and filling without being too heavy.\n\nService was good - attentive but not overly so. The woman seated next us complained that her mimosa didn't have enough of a kick and was immediately brought a second, complimentary one. \n\nWould definitely reccomend for brunch.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Yummy breakfast, good service, fair price point.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I went here for lunch the other day. I had the salmon sandwhich and my boyfriend had the ham and cheese on a baguette. One word- amazing. Fish tasted fresh and portions just right. We had the pecan whiskey pie to top things off...and wow....heaven on earth. Our waitress was friendly and I got to practice my french with her. \n\nIts been two days and I can't stop thinking about the pie!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Had brunch there.  Even though I've read mixed reviews about this place, my dining experience there was decent.  The waiter was nice and friendly.\n\nI had cafe au lait avec lait de soya (pretty much a soy latte as it was made with expresso instead of coffee), and it came in a big soup bowl, interesting!  I got the brunch sucré (crepe with french toast).  It came with freshly squeezed orange juice, and that was just awesome!  I love the OJ.  They gave us an 'amusee-bouche,' which was like a bread pudding (and much larger than an one-biter!).  It was a bit cold but very tasty (cinnamon!!!).  My main course came with yogurt with granola and blueberries (decent), french toast with apple butter/blueberries.  The apple butter was good.  The french toast was a little disappointing though (a little stale perhaps?).  And it came with the 2 crepes with raspberry sauce and orange zest.  The crepes were disappointing.  The texture was a little rubbery.  Definitely not my favorite there.\n\nMy friend got the Brunch Cartet (ham/cheese sandwich), and she said that was delicious.  My other friend got the Brunch L'Atlantique (salmon bagel, salmon with eggs, and salmon cake), and I totally prefer that over my sucré brunch!\n\nAside from the brunch sucré, the food, the service, and the decor of Le Cartet was pretty good!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	It's been a while so I'm writing from memory and I remember liking this place. Not great for babies though, small space.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Overrated..\n\nAtmosphere: Too many seats so they can pack as many people in to make the most $ in the least amount of time. It's not comfortable and it's not cool to eat elbow-to-elbow with strangers, especially when one person is coughing continuously and it's so hot in the room you know it's a hotbed of colds and flu waiting to happen. It's a condo decor-as-restaurant-themed location that's so over and tired; but if the diners are impressed, who cares, because they don't know any better.\n\nFood: For lunch, quiche (too many rosemary sprigs), and pulled pork sandwich (cinnamon, cumin, and clove?) and leek soup with hard pieces of stalk.\n\nService: When the server removed our plates that were more than 2/3 full, there was no question about whether we liked our dishes. \n\nThere are better places in the neighbourhood by far.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Loved this spot, very charming and great food! A delight all the way through:)
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	The service ruined what could have been an average experience.  Our waiter did not pay attention to us, serving others first.  We ordered several dishes such as the Brunch Atlantic, Quiche and Salmon Cakes. They were average at best and nothing memorable. Further our orders were mistaken and drink orders delayed. I hope it was just an anomaly.  Be prepared to wait.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Apparently the place to be. Had about an hour wait. Food was good. Service was on par. Long lunchroom style tables.. Cute snacking market on the side . \n\nI don't think they take reservations so get here early. \nWe shared a blueberry French toast even though individual plates were more than enough but when you wait on that line you just want to try everything.. It was delicious!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Awesome coffees, lots of options. The orange black moka is not to be missed. The bowls of latte are decadent. The breakfast is heart but not heavy. Wanted to try tge almond croissant and their french toast but we missed it, thats what you get for showing up for a late breakfast. Next time we will come earlier. Definitely recommend this as the breakfast place to be.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This fantastic place is located a short walk from the Old Montreal center. I had a beautiful brunch platter that came with a buttery croissant with goat cheese and ham, a fruit salad, green salad, salmon cake, cheese, fig, and scrambled eggs. Delicious mimosas too! The staff is warm and friendly. Excellent meal and service.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I was expecting more from Le Cartet given their reviews.  We arrived at 11:30am on a Sunday and waited 45 minutes for a table.  My iced coffee consisted of hot coffee pour over ice.  The ice melted after two sips.  I ordered the 2-minute egg with ham and cheese and toast.  The egg and the toast were good.  The ham and cheese were disappointing.  They looked like they were from a supermarket deli.  \n\nI would not recommend this restaurant.  It was not worth the wait.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	LOVED our brunch here.  Brought our baby in a stroller, and while it took a little while to get a table, the staff were welcoming and accommodating.  \n\nMy brunch was delicious - ham & cheese on a croissant with salad and fruit.  Hubby got the Atlantic platter, and raved about it.  Oh and my lattlé bowl was a GREAT cup of coffee.  \n\nGreat service.  Bright, sunny and trendy decor.  Fun vibe.  \n\n(Note that many of the tables are communal, but with the upbeat and busy vibe, you don't even hear the people beside you).
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Great service. Great food. There is a waiting line if you go around lunch time. But line moves fast and it's so worth the wait. Very bustling inside with locals and tourists alike. Best brunch quality- big platter in huge portion and delicacies not offered anywhere else like salmon cake etc. The crepe in the "sucre" brunch is handsdown the best. If you come from the US, this is a completely different and better brunch experience :)
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Endroit par excellence pour les brunchs entres amis du weekend!\n\nJ'adore l'ambiance.. Les choix de brunchs assez variés pour combler toutes les types d'envies! \n\nIl faut , la plupart du temps, faire la file à l'entrée, comme ils ne prennent pas de réservation lors du brunch. Cela vaut toutefois la peine d'attendre un petit 10-15 minutes! \n\nLa boutique à l'avant nous laisse zyeuter la grande variété de chocolat et de café durant notre attente. \n\nÀ essayer !
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Probably one of the best breakfast experiences I've had.\n\nI chose Le Cartet for my first breakfast in Montreal, a Sunday morning.  The reviews for L'Avenue had stated the very long lines on Sunday, so I figured I'd do that on Monday instead.  \n\nWell much to my surprise, there was a long line here as well (about 25 minutes around 9:30am), and if it wasn't a sunny morning, you'd be stuck out in the rain or snow - as the line goes out the door and down the stairs to the outside.  Regardless, it's such a charming setting on the southern end of Rue McGill.  \n\nOnce I was seated, I took in the minimalistic pleasantness of the restaurant.  High ceilings, rustic, white walls and columns, and it's set up like a long corridor with what appears like one, long table creating a communal setting, and also the option of separate tables around.  Each table was adorned with a huge, clear vase of fully-stemmed sunflowers!  One of my favorites!  \n\nI ordered the Brunch Sante, which consists of two poached eggs over toast that has been smeared in an herbed goat cheese and topped with greens, a side of yogurt mixed with granola and blueberries (the best), a dried fig, two medium-sized white cheddar sticks, a skewer of fresh fruit... and before they even bring it out, they give you a small cube of this delicious, most chocolate chip cake/pastry that gets all melty in your mouth full of Illy coffee.  This was easily my favorite meal from the entire trip!  It beats L'Avenue in terms of a clean, healthy, nutrient-rich breakfast - and the presentation is lovely.  \n\nService is wonderful.  So sweet and caring.  \n\nIt's $14.95, which is a decent deal for the amount of food you get (I eat like a pig and I couldn't finish), and it's worth every dime.  I can't wait to return again for breakfast, and also for lunch.  Don't skip Le Cartet if you're ever in Montreal.  It's on the way from downtown to Vieux Montreal (Old Montreal/Old Port), and a great stop along the way.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Bon spot pour les brunchs. Tables communales et certaines individuelles, pas un endroit où aller si vous chercher l'intimité car les tables sont très collées. Par contre, beau choix de déjeuner non-traditionnels (particulièrement leurs différentes offres de Brunch de santé à Cartet, et de lunch en semaine, belle ambiance. Brunch santé, sucré, Toscan ou Cartet et le midi leur célèbre sandwich aux oeufs qui est vraiment excellent!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Nous y sommes allés pour un brunch ! Service impeccable? Serveuse aux petits soins ! Assiette bien garnie avec produits de qualité! Café servi avec refill gratuits ( pas négligeable pour un brunch). Beau décor et belle ambiance ! Un peu d attente le dimanche matin mais vite oublié par la qualité du lieu !
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Love this place. The breakfasts and brunches are original and delicious, and the coffee excellent. Service is fast friendly and attentive. The one downside is that you often have to wait for a table, especially if you want to sit outside. It's well worth the wait.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Great brunch spot! I love the vibe. It's a cross between family friendly and urban sheek. I had the goat cheese scrambled eggs with thick cut bacon and fresh fruit. It was wonderful!!!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Very good service and atmosphere. Slightly over priced but mind you it's in touristy area of the city. Food quality is very good but it's not the best.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	My traveling group enjoyed breakfast here two mornings of our recent long weekend excursion.  Thanks to some preliminary Yelp research, we knew we had to get there early to avoid a wait, so we arrived between 9:30 and 10:00 both Saturday and Monday morning and got right in.  I wouldn't recommend this place for a large party, but we were lucky and snagged one of the long bench tables for our party of 8.  I really liked the modern vibe here, kind of a chic breakfast loft is how I'd describe it.  Service was polite and efficient with minimal banter.  Given the line out the door as we left, I gather they're very interested in turning tables over at a reasonable rate.  \n\nThe food was quite good and felt way more wholesome than a Denny's or an IHOP.  On my first visit I had the coupe santé with the ginger granola and blueberry yogurt.  I don't know quite how to describe it, but the yogurt was incredible.  It had the consistency of Greek yogurt, but tasted creamier and less tart than the Chobani in my fridge.  The fruit alongside was amazingly fresh and despite my reservations, there was more than enough food to keep me fueled until mid-afternoon.  My second visit I sampled the torta mixta.  This Portuguese sandwich was not exactly teeming with French-Canadian influence, but I was so intrigued by the addition of mustard to the egg sandwich.  I've never had it that way and I must say, it works.  C'est magnifique!     \n\nA short walk from our hotel, Le Cartet was a great way to start our mornings in my favorite weekend getaway city.  I imagine there will be at least one repeat visit on our next trip up.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Completely Amazing is all I have to say!  had Sunday brunch there yesterday with my wife and 3 friends on the recommendation of the concierge at Hotel Gault.  Atmosphere at Le Cartet had us on entry (hard to do with 4 young hip architects from Toronto in the group).  Service was superb and the food...sublime!    \n\nArrived at 10am which is early for Montrealer's and found it already packed.  A 5 minute wait landed this party of five at one of the long communal tables.  Who knew they opened at 9am on Sundays?\n\nFrom a traditional Farmers Breakfast style to the healthy fruit and granola options, each one is served fresh and with a little panache!\n\nTheir little front shop had lots of grab-n-go fare as well as the most amazing assortment of chocolates!  I think we spent more in the store than on lunch!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Voilà deux fois que je vais au Cartet, et cet endroit mérite amplement ses 5 étoiles !\n\nLe première, pour le lunch, j'en été ressortie ravie en rassasiée. J'avais pris un délicieux tartare de bœuf, bien relevé, servi avec patates rôties et salade maison. Un régal.\nLa seconde, pour le brunch (et oui, toujours mon péché mignon !) et j'en suis repartie comblée.\nIls ne servent le brunch que le week-end, mais ça vaut le coup d'attendre : œufs bénédictines revisités (avec béchamel et jambon cuit), assiette complète avec galette au saumon, croissant jambon - fromage de chèvre divin (brunch Le Cartet). Le tout servi avec café maison et jus d'orange. Le prix est plus que correct, et le tout est frais, fait maison.\n\nNous sommes attablés à d'immenses tables, ambiance conviviale recherchée (et réussie). J'aime la déco contemporaine : briques blanches, tableaux noirs représentants les pays, grande cuisine ouverte sur la salle...\nLe petit (grand) plus : c'est aussi une épicerie ! Ils proposent des produits Européens : vin, pâtes, sauces maisons... et des plats préparés.\n\n\nCet endroit est un délice, c'est sûr que j'y reviendrai !
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Good brunch, super cute restaurant and shop. The staff was attentive, though there was no air conditioning on the day we attended, it got a bit humid. Was looking for a meal with veggies and eggs, but there wasn't anything similar on the menu, ended up ordering a dish with too much meat for my liking. That said, the ham was delicious. Great location. Fresh squeezed orange juice. Indoor and outdoor seating, not a long wait. For reference: I live in the US, I travel frequently, love healthy eating, and eat out ~4 times/week.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Wow just wow. \n\nWe arrived a few minutes after 9am on a Sunday, and I must say I was surprised by how quickly all the tables around us filled up and how many people came in and out for take out, etc. (Note the outside tables are for eat-in diners only you naughty to-go sandwich grabbers).\n\nThey have gorgeous huge brunch platters as their signature dishes for eat in and yum yum yum was it worth every penny. The first thing to note is the emphasis on the brunch element of the brunch platter - this will do you for two meals. My "Le Cartet" plate came with a ham and goat cheese croissant (buttery, flaky, light cheesy, smoky ham, YUM), a scrambled egg, a small cup of greek yogurt, a fruit shish kabob (strawberry, orange, grapefruit, pineapple), two slices of cheese, a fig, a salmon cake, and mesclun salad.) WHEW. I could not eat it all. The mimosa was quite strong with pulpy (fresh squeezed?) orange juice. \n\nPresentation is important to me, I like my food to look and smell good as well as taste spectacular, and here, too, Le Cartet was a huge hit. The fruit shish kabob was cute, and the salmon cake served as a nice hub for a hub and spoke-esque plate presentation. In addition the plates come with coffee and juice! And I almost forgot the beginning of the meal - a coffee cakeish amuse bouche. Delightful! \n\nEach of the flavors was smooth and tasty - not too much salt, everything was balanced by lovely creaminess. Service was attentive, informative, and excellent.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Plusieurs reprises pour bruncher dans ce restaurant, car la file y est longue ici. Mais durant l'été un peu moins de monde. Le choix du plat du brunch et intérieur du restaurant sont très agréable. Avec une mention spéciale pour leur petite boutique qui est très accueillante.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This is my favourite brunch place. I think possibly ever.... Yep, ever.\n\nThere is always a line (it moves quickly). The food is delicious and arrives fast at the table. \n\nCoffee is also on point and the option to add a mimosa to your brunch plate is perfect.\n\nMy fave plates are the brunch sante or whatever the one is with salmon - YAS!\n\nLove the selection of ready made foods and gourmet gifts (coffees, chocolates, olives, etc).\n\nIf I am visiting Montreal, this is one of my must stop places to visit.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	The food was incredible and the place itself is just fantastic, perfect for a sunday brunch if you like a trendy, yet casual ambiance. It has a bit NYC market/bistro charm.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Excellent service, friendly staff.\nNicely decorated place with creative and healthy menu. Strongly recommended for brunch.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Great spot and seems to be popular with the locals. Really good coffee bar and brunch menu.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I have been to Le Cartet a total of 5 times. Everything is always great. Super fresh ingredients and good service. The wraps are great, the duck confit also great and the brunch also very good.\nHighly recommend it\nTHEY DO NOT TAKE AMERICAN EXPRESS
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	We shared the plate with eggs, ham, bacon and potatoes with a side of yogurt, blueberries and granola. The yogurt is deliciously plain and thick! The portions are massive. I recommend you share!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Everything is good, the decor, the ambiance, the service and the food. The only drawback for me is the price...it's a little steep for brunch.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Long wait at 11:45 am on a Saturday, accompanied by expensive (yet terrible) food. Would never come back. Not sure why so many people are willing to wait. For god's sake, walk 10-15 minutes to Olive et Gourmando instead. Worst brunch I've had in a long time. Why is this so highly rated on Yelp!?!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Came here on Monday morning. No lines, no wait. Waited for breakfast to come out for about 1/2 hour, which is ok. The breakfast came out cold. The poached eggs were overcooked and placed on multigrain bread with about a 1/2" of butter on it .  Wilted greens accompanied the overcooked cold eggs. Would not return.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Our food was served cold, our waitress barely spoke to us and we had to walk around the restau to find her and get our bill. We left very unimpressed. We asked for vegetarian fare and they brought us something with duck. They didnt apologize or remake the meal, just scraped it off the plate and brought it back. \n\nThe cheese was good.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Arrived just a bit too late for breakfast so we had sandwich. Very good ham and cheese with gazpacho. Very welcoming atmosphere and not very  crowded at lunch time on a Monday. We also had pulled pork and chichen sandwich. The chicken was the beat thing on the table. Will be returning anytime we are in Montreal.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This is my go-to place for brunch in my 'hood. What I like about this place:\n- Simple and delicate yet NOT intimidating decoration, ambience, clientèle\n- My words won't do justice for other orders but here are some highlights when you order "Brunch des Cantons" ($11.95) the one I always get:\na) before the main brunch, they bring you baguettes with confitures (tartinades)\nb) "Brunch des Cantons" is served on a heavy hot pan, to keep it warm. \nc) contains ham, sausage, bacon (all three meats! big+ for my in-decisiveness when it comes to choose one out of the three), home-made potatoes with fine herbs, fruits,  and take note Baguette. \nd) the portion is very generous (I can never finish everything, and I have a big appetite for breakfast)\n- Most of the waiters/waitresses are friendly, soft-spoken hipsters. So are the clients. Their clients are: 25% business people working around old-port, 35% Artists working in the area, 20% some tourists, 20% residence. \n- Yet another + for this place is they have a bar area behind cashier, where you can buy organic food, exotic products, lunch in boxes, illy coffee. \n- In the morning till noon, they have illy coffee for 2.5$. Points card, where you can collect points (10 coffee to get 1 for free)\n- Brunch for weekdays is 7am-11am; After that, they have lunch. Weekends from 9am to 3pm. There's usually a line for the weekends unless you get there before 11am.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	A few days ago, my friend and I went to Le Cartet around noon in hopes of catching a late breakfast. Unfortunately we had just missed breakfast time by thirty minutes but decided to stay anyway -- Very glad we did!\n\nFood: \nCauliflower soup - Served in individual mini Le Creuset dutch ovens. Major fan of not just the presentation but also the creamy and flavourful soup\nDuck leg with scalloped potatoes and arugula salad - Duck leg was very filling (in a good way) and scalloped potatoes were so, so satisfying. Neither of us like arugula and forgot to sub it out but it did look good. \nPulled pork sandwich - Chips and pickles on the side. A bit of a kick to the pulled pork, brioche bun was on point, perfectly toasted. \nCarrot cake - Soooooo moist. Cream cheese icing was tart and not too sweet. Tons of nuts and raisins in the cake. Perfect way to end off the lunch \nMaple latte - Very smooth and well, maple-y\n\nService - Attentive, efficient and knew the menu very well\n\nDecor - Clean cut, light wooden tables. Perfect for breakfast, lunch, business meetings etc. Boutique and ready to eat dishes at the front. Was swayed by the maple chocolate on the way out!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Delicious breakfast. Unique plates and combinations. Tables are a bit tightly packed.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	If you're standing in line for brunch while you read this, please reconsider. There are probably a thousand places that are just as cute within walking distance. Get on your Yelp app and find one of them before you get cranky.\n\nWe came on a weekday late-morning for brunch and it was still packed with tourists. Which is not a bad thing per se, but it does overburden the staff, who were unsmiling and clearly in the weeds despite the off-hour.\n\nBoth of our orders were messed up, but we ate them anyway (see above under "cranky"). They were ok, but we're talking about straightforward variations on eggs and potatoes. \n\nThe space is beautifully designed, hovering somewhere between rustic and hip, but it was filled with flies (see above under "please reconsider"). \n\nYelp has rarely steered me wrong, but this a disappointment that I (as a tourist) felt partly responsible for.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Good place for breakfast/Brunch . sleek decoration. Fresh food . Good service
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Delicious food. Outstanding service. Great vibe. Loved the cappuccino and egg scramble. The fresh yogurt with granola was a standout. They overcharged us for one item, but still forgiven.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	We were there for a weekend brunch. Got the Brunch Sucre and Brunch des Cantons. Both were not good. \nFirst, we got a table that was really sloped. \nAfter switching table, we got the food. \nI had Brunch Sucre. It was so average, nothing really stood out at all. The pancake had some raspberry sauce on top, which was sour. The French toast tasted like some pre-packaged banana bread. \nMy boyfriend had Brunch des Cantons, it was greasy. And the dish tasted nothing spectacular. \n\nDecor was nice.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Be sure to arrive early to avoid the line ups!\n\nSo this is a popular brunch place amongst Montrealers with a shop in front of the restaurant that sells pâté, all sorts of chocolates, goodies, etc. \n\nTo be completely honest, their food wasn't memorable. I got the Brunch Cartet and the rest of my party got the Brunch Toscan and Brunch de l'Atlantique. I enjoyed the first bite of my salmon cake but then it was just dry afterwards - would be nice to throw some sauce on the side. Our brunch came with orange juice which was a plus.\n\nI thought the food was "okay" and nothing more. I wouldn't return.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I stumbled upon this place when I was in Montreal on vacation. A large group of my friends stumbled upon it, with no guidance from me, when THEY were in Montreal on vacation. Most recently, I convinced a group of colleagues to rush here for a quick pre-airport breakfast when I was in Montreal on business.\n\nThe reactions are, without fail, unanimous declarations of adoration. What more do you need?
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Worth the wait!  Among the best brunch spots in Montreal for sure. Don't be turned off by the lineup, it moves fast and will be worth it.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Pretty good brunch place. We went on a Sunday and the wait was about 35 minutes. The salmon brunch plate was amazing- salmon omnelet, lox on a half bagel with various greens and the mocha was rich and chocolately. The Bloody Mary was not too good though, it tasted premade, but the Montreal seasoning they used to line the rim of the glass was a nice touch. Atmosphere is nice with communal seating.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Le Cartet had decent selections, but I wasn't really impressed. The crepes weren't as tasty as I thought. I had the crabcakes and they were good but again not something to write about. Overall I would recommend this place for a nice brunch. They have a store in the front so that is worth visiting for gifts to bring to friends and family.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	High end without being pretentious. Very nice place to get a breakfast that is different than the traditional greasy sausage and greasy eggs. This place offers a light airy breakfast with out of this world hand made croissants. \n\nI have been here a bunch of times and nothing I have eaten on the menu leaves you feeling all greased out and every time I leave satisfied and full.\n\nIt's a little pricey, I mean a LITTLE bit pricey but the trade off of money vs quality is very well proportioned.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I used to like it and visit every weekend, but the last two times when I went I had salmon cake.. It was horrible. It tasted garbage and smell weird. I had tried it before, and I used to like it.. But those times.. I don't know what happened, but it was disgusting. I was very unhappy. Every since then I stopped having my brunch.  I think other dishes should be fine.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Bon endroit pour prendre son petit dejeuner. L'ambiance est chic et le service correct. Enfroit parfait pour diner d'affaire et rencontre entre amis.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Long wait for food and not very accommodating for strollers but the food was good and the shop in front was nice to browse while waiting
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Lovely little front counter mini epicerie area with amazing muffins, bottled smoothies and other drinks, excellent coffee to go. But really if you have time and don't mind spending a little more, sit down in the calm, bright restaurant and enjoy the excellent brunch specials on the chalkboard.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Best breakfast/brunch spot in Montreal, IMHO ... you must try the Brunch Sucre - its to die for!  Cafe au lait is wonderful, and service is fantastic! It helps to speak French but the servers (most of them) speak English.  Anticipate a wait out the door (1 hr?) on weekend mornings ... its worth it!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	A wonderful place for a casual meal in a pleasant upscale setting!  Our breakfast was served with a smile by a professional waitperson.  We were glad we started our day here!  Just the right amount of energy for subtle fun and good for people watching.  Nice edited selection of items to take home or great for gifts.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	There are brunch spots that make bacon and eggs, and then there's Le Cartet. \n\nFlawlessly executed breakfasts, great service and an excellent atmosphere, this is probably the most fun I've had at brunch in a while.  \n\nIt's a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Ça faisait longtemps que je n'étais pas allé au Cartet pour diner, pourtant c'est à deux pas du bureau.\n\nC'est toujours aussi bon et le service y est aimable et efficace. Je ne me souvenais pas que c'était abordable en plus. \n\nCe midi, les pâtes carbonara étaient dignes de l'Italie. Je crois que je vais y retourner plus souvent.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	So far this is my favorite restaurant in Montreal!\nExcellent food and service for a good price. The brunch menu is to die for, lots of healthy option and it's vegetarian friendly. Good coffee as well!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Nice place, clean, cozy and inviting environment. \nSuits all ages (They have crayons and menu for kids).\nThe staff is nice and knowledgable.\nThe prices are decent.\nBut I would say the food is decent, not that extraordinary or special..\n\nThey also have a little shop to buy teas or chocolates which is nice! (although pricey)\n\nTip: Come early (9am) on Saturday and get a great brunch! It gets busy afterwards..
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	A nice place for brunch. Service is good in general. I ordered the poached eggs, spinach and English muffins. The taste is good.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	The Tuscan dish was fabulous!!! The eggs were perfectly poached and the ham was seasoned and cooked beautifully. We enjoyed our meal very much!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Crowded, Uncomfortable, and Over-Priced.\n\nNever understood the hype about this spot. Have had breakfast/brunch here a few times, and the experience was always unenjoyable.\n\nThe seating arrangements are awkward, and a little too close for comfort. The food is unremarkable for the price. And the service is generally slow and unorganized.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	My two previous visits to Le Cartet during prior visits to Montreal were unsuccessful, as I always seemed to have a knack for arriving just as their kitchen was closing. I was excited to get there at 11am on a weekday to find the kitchen open, but my happiness was crested when I found out that only a limited menu was served in the time between breakfast and lunch. So, begrudgingly, I chose a goat cheese and vegetable frittata -- one of only two options available. \n\nGiven that there were only two options, I thought I'd get some sort of half-assed meal, but I was totally wrong -- the frittata was awesome: fluffy, perfectly cooked, and served in an individual glazed cast iron ramekin (I'm a sucker for food in individual compartments). I also ordered orange juice, which was fresh-squeezed but not too pulpy.  On my way out, I grabbed some prepared food from the cold cases near the front of the shop to stock the fridge in my nearby rental. Delicious, and without the prefab food taste or feel you might get at other delis.  \n\nThe best thing about my visit, however, was non-food related -- the cafe has this great artwork on the walls by an artist named James Kennedy (http://jameskennedy.ca), who uses hot rolled steel to produce these really interesting (and reasonably priced) pieces. My partner and I dug the art so much, we contacted the artist and purchased a piece. So, thanks to Le Cartet, I left with a happy tummy AND a very cool souvenir of my trip to this amazing city. :)
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Un des plus beaux déjeuners de Montréal. \n\nPour ce qui est des plats, les portions étaient parfaitement appropriées et la nourriture était délicieuse. Je dois y aller avec le reste des commentaires : il existe une originalité singulière au Cartet. Plusieurs options plus santé m'ont automatiquement plu. Également, le café était délicieux, l'espresso n'étant pas brulé. Pour les amateurs de café : le leur est très fruité. \n\nLes prix sont correctes, rien d'exagéré. \n\nJ'ai beaucoup aimé le décor très moderne, ainsi que les tables communes 'style bar' qui permettent de partager un siège avec d'autre gens. \n\nMon seul point négatif, c'est les longues files le week-end et le manque d'unité dans l'assiette. C'est l'impression d'avoir plusieurs choses devant soi... Mais de ne pas voir de liens entre elles. Les oeufs brouillés sont un peu ordinaires.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Ordered 'Brunch Sucre' and it definitely lived up to its name - crepes topped with sweet fruit sauce and berries, along with greek yoghurt and granola. Big servings, I couldn't finish.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	À ses premières années, Le Cartet était très bien pour ses brunchs du dimanche. Maintenant c'est trop à la mode, trop de monde, trop branché, trop bruyant. J'y vais tout de même encore pour ses petits plats cuisinés succulents pour emporter.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	VIBE \nThe decor at Le Cartet is awesome. Cool castor-esque light bulbs hang down from the ceilings. Cool cut outs of maps are on the wall and big pots of poinsettas are in the back. I can see it's a buzzy type of place for brunch/lunch. I came for lunch but where Le Cartet really misses out is on its service. \n\nI was not greeted. I was not asked normal things like: would you like something to drink? I had to ask for the specials. \n\nI ATE \nI had the salmon sandwich. It was a decent sandwich but I assumed I'd have slices of salmon as opposed to it being a creamy mishmash of a tuna melt. It was solid food but way overpriced with a measley green salad for $15. \n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nLe meh. That said, I would come back if I'm directly in the area for ambiance or to buy something in the market. Otherwise, it's a bit on the edge of Old Montreal and out of the way for something that is ho-hum.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Amazing food and wonderful service! We got there right before it opened and we're lucky to get an outside table. It was a gorgeous day and the breakfast was simply incredible. My husband was not very thrilled with his Salmon cake but other than that scarfed the rest of his and mine down!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Excellent brunch/breakfast.  This place offers a variety a breakfast dishes that taste amazing.  I am not a breakfast fan, but this place changed my mind
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	After pretty much only sticking to a few local chains for breakfast I can honestly say Le Cartet is a must try for brunch. The staff is welcoming and super attentive, the food is honest and delicious, and the airy atmosphere just exudes good energy and warmth. We managed to beat the rush on 1/1 but the place got really busy towards the end of our meal. Get there, order Les Cantons (which comes in a cast-iron skillet), order the fresh juice, and enjoy the rest of your day.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Flavor is lost & can't find it's way to Cartet. The brunch is the best meal option here. All in all the place is way overpriced for what you get - middle of the road quality and not always fresh. Beware of the grab and go options. The salads can be old, lettuce wilted, and tasteless across the board. The cookies are hard, and they ain't biscotti. The espresso is Illy brand so it's pretty good. They sell so many food products, it could be a mini (overpriced) general store. If the pickings are slim, which they can be in this area, it is a good bet but Cartet is not a place to go out of your way for. Its a place that's the best of the not so great.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This is a really popular brunch place and always packed. I thought the presentation of the food was really nice, as everything was nicely arranged, but the food wasn't anything particularly special. If you want a nice, hip brunch place this definitely fits the bill, but if you're looking to have some really good food there are better brunch places!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	If you're stuck at this part of the Old Port and you have nowhere else to go, ok. \n\nOtherwise, there are bunch of other places in Montreal with 10 times better service. The food is ok, nothing special. But I think they don't think their customers as returning customers they don't really care about the service that much. \n\nIf you're a tourist in Montreal, it means that you have the time to take the cab or the metro to go places. Spend 20 more minutes and go to Lawrence, Manitoba or VORO. Eat better, experience a nicer place. At the end, that's why you're visiting Montreal!\n\nIf you're a local, I'm pretty sure you won't go here anyways, unless your friends are like "Oh, we found this place but don't remember the name. Let's go there." then you end up here.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This is a great spot for brunch with generous portions.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	A bit expensive to eat sandwichs... Place is good, service is good but too expensive.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	My family and I went here for brunch based on the great reviews, and we weren't disappointed!\n\nI got Le Sante as people seemed to be suggesting, and was quite pleased. The poached eggs were perfection. The mixed greens they lay atop were fresh and a nice addition to the meal. I asked for my pesto cheese on the side and didn't try it, so I can't speak for that, but I can only assume that it would have been phenomenal. The greek yogurt was topped generously with a sweet granola with fresh blueberries, served with honey on the side - it was the perfect mix of both tart and sweet! \n\nMy other half got Le Nordique, which he thoroughly enjoyed...he was even kind enough to share some of it with me!\n\nThe parents both got the salmon bagel plate; they substituted a baguette for the bagel and loved every crunchy bite. Served open-faced with the cream cheese on the side, it was a lighter meal than the heavy brunch plates. \n\nThe atmosphere was hip with long communal wooden tables, service was attentive but not overbearingly so. I'd definitely come back if I find myself in Montreal again.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	We rented an airbnb about 3 stores down from this place and every time we stepped foot outside there was a line coming from Le Cartet that reached our door. My first thought? "Gotta yelp this place" and I did.\n\nSo we queued up on line one sunny afternoon for brunch. The line moved slowly and a few times I almost made an about face, but thanks to this one overly enthusiastic guy behind me I toughed it out. He raved on and on about the food to some other strangers while he waited for his girlfriend. \n\nSome time passes, don't even know how long, and we finally get inside and get seated. As we're sitting down I see a waiter walk by with a carafe of OJ in one hand and a bottle of champagne in another. I told our waitress "I want that" (yes, kind of like a toddler at a candy store). $37 gets you a bottle of champagne with a free carafe of OJ. For two of us, we got about 5 glasses each. Pretty sweet deal.\n\nThe food here is actually really pricey for brunch dishes, averaging at about $16 per dish. We thanked our lucky stars that the USD was strong so we balled out! I had the Brunch Des Cantons $17.99 (English breakfast style dish: beans, ham, bacon, eggs, sausage in a cast iron skillet) and my boo thang had the Toasta Mixta $11.29 (egg, ham, cheese, onions, and mustard sandwich). Both dishes were overall good but they could use some tweaks. The skillet dish was a little bland and the bread on the sandwich should've been toasted so it can hold better. It just kept falling apart.\n\nService was great. Is this place worth the wait? I'm torn so I'll leave that up to you.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I love this cute resto/boutique! I stayed across the street at St. Paul and it was such a nice quick walk to a place that has so much to offer. I had Scrambled Eggs with Toast (scrambled with goat cheese), side of fresh delicious fruit and potatoes and Maple latte. It was the perfect start to my day! I also came back two days later to buy some goodies to take back to my office-mates. The cashier suggested Caramel Pecans and Maple Covered Almonds -- both of them are yummy, not so indulgent yet so "uniquely Montreal."
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	We were in Old Montreal for brunch and I really wanted to try Olive & Gourmando, but it had a 30-45 minute wait and we were in a rush, so we walked a few blocks to Le Cartet.  There was a wait here too, but since we got here relatively early (10am), we only had to wait 5 minutes or so.  I love the space, it reminds me of Le Pain Quotidien in NYC.  There is a huge communal table in the middle and a few two/four-tops on the side.  The dishes were not cheap for brunch in Montreal (CAD 19), but they include a coffee, juice and an amuse bouche, as well as a large plate of food, so not a bad deal.\n\nI had the Brunch Cartet, which included a croissant sandwich with ham and cheese, salmon cake, side salad, a few slices of cheddar cheese and fresh fruits.  I love croissants, but I don't indulge in it often.  This was a delicious sandwich with a good ham-cheese-to-croissant ratio.  Also, the croissant itself was well-made.  I wasn't crazy about the salmon cake.  The menu description for this dish mentioned a fig, and I was quite disappointed that it was a dried fig and not a fresh one, but that's just me being nit-picking.\n\nThe guy ordered Brunch De L'atlantique, which included a small bagel with smoked salmon, scrambled egg with smoked salmon, as well as salmon cake, salad and fruits.  I really liked the smoked salmon and scrambled egg combo, the bagel was pretty good too.\n\nThe service was attentive without being intrusive, I've got coffee and water refills immediately.  The dining room was packed but it didn't feel tight.  It was a good brunch place.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I was visiting Montreal and looking for a new brunch place when Le Cartert came up in conversation. While the location in old port is a bit touristy, don't let it full you this place is great. Service and atmosphere were both good. Brunch options on the sweet and savoury side were plentiful and the salmon brunch was incredible! It came with naturally a bagle and lox, fruit, perfectly fluffy scrambled eggs with salmon and some salad. topped up with a latte bowl for a winning brunch!\n\nSurprisingly reservations were not needed.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	If you had one morning in Montreal - especially a Saturday or Sunday...Come here! Fresh, delicious food. The Berry French Toast was to die for. It was not your typical whip cream and syrup variety but very original and unique. I dined at the communal table which was fantastic. Families, groups, dates, solo? It doesn't matter. This is your go to spot for brunch in Montreal.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Worth the wait! \nWe waited outside on line for about 20 minutes before being seated. Once we started eating, we completely forgot about the wait. \nFor $15 we were served a cup of coffee or cappuccino, a glass of fresh squeezed OJ, 2 poached eggs on toast that had been smeared with goat cheese (OUTSTANDING!!), a cup of fresh yogurt topped with homemade granola and black currants, and fresh fruit. \n\nWould have been a 5 star review, but the waiter forgot our Amuse Bouche and we had to ask multiple times for the check. In his defence, he was very friendly and the place was super packed.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I want to be able to give this fresh place more stars, so maybe I'll go back and try again- but based on the brunch I had last Saturday, this is the most deserving rating.  It looks great when you walk in~ fresh food displayed, great decor.  The menu is diverse for brunch.  My friend got an egg dish and latte which she really enjoyed. \n\nI on the other hand had my mouth water over their Banana Coconut (french) Toast with Yogurt and fruit.  It looked good when it came (~5min after my friends dish), however the top toast was lukewarm and the bottom refridgerator cold bananas throughout the cold toast.  I asked the server if it was supposed to be cold and she apologized and took it away.  Only to return a few minutes later with the Same one I tried before, now pipping hot and soggy ~ I suspected microwave- and asked if that was the case. She said no, but  they would now make me a fresh one.  Surprised that didn't happen initially.  Much to my surprise, a "fresh" one arrived burnt! not just a little either...  Done with sending it back I ate around the most burnt pieces.  Coconut torched is not the most pleasant taste.  Maybe this was an anomaly, but surprised that this was my experience.  The good thing is that the waitress was very friendly and nice- but the kitchen was off for my dish.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I found this gem on my Yelp App while searching "great breakfast spots".  I had every intention of waking up at 8 am the next day, doing my hair (just enough to look cool, but not trying too hard) and heading to Le Cartet for breakfast on a Friday.  Well, I was jet lagged and  woke up at 10:30, half did my hair and rushed down Rue McGill to try to catch breakfast, but I was too late, I was handed the lunch menu -- Boo!  I wanted to try to fit in with all the well dressed staff and patrons, so I pretended to understand the French menu and ordered what I thought was a goat cheese, almond and date salad.  Well, what I got was a warm pate of goat cheese, with almonds and dates in it served over lettuce and a few pieces of crostini.  I was confused, but kept up my "I'm a local and totally expected this" act.  I was pleasantly surprised with my selection!  So much so, that I came back for brunch the next day and had the Brunch Sucre.  It was definitely a carb and sugar overload, but worth it!  Capuccinos were small but tasty.  Each time I came here I spent around $20 CAN.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	This is hands down the best breakfast spot in Montreal! Ambiance and service are spot on, it is always busy but you never feel rushed. The coffees and juice are top notch. You have to try the eggs benedict they are phenomenal. I don't know how they get the ham to taste as great as it does. Potatoes roasted in duck fat and fresh fruit round out a fantastic plate. For the quality of food and experience you cannot beat the price either. Can't wait to make it back there!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Breakfast in Montreal!! the lineup is out the door and the wait was about 45 min. \n\nafter a big mug of latte, i feel a bit more relaxed and less grumpy. For four people, we ordered the crepe meal, salmon meal, and a egg benedict meal ( the actual names are in french, i have no idea) and that was quite enough. Our waitress was helpful and she was happy to help us out. Everything was good except the salmon cake and salmon egg - it was a bit fishy, did it come from a can? I wasn't liking my fishy smelly egg thingy in the kremlin - all the other foods were good. Cute decor, great crowd, packed restaurant. I really enjoyed  my meal here. I thought I'd have enough stomach space for a croissant in the end.. all the baked goods look so amazing at the entrance. Maybe i'll come again in the future just for the baked goods!\n\nfree wi-fi, that's always a bonus!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Excellent brunch.  Good coffee, fresh fruit was grapefruit, orange and melon, all flavorful.  Eggs were cooked perfectly, fantastic breads. Great service as well.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	If you're ever visiting Montreal, come here. The food is fantastic as is the service. The reviews are spot on - this is not to be missed.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	A total zoo on the weekends, but just an incredible atmosphere, great food (skillets ftw!), and perhaps the most capable service staff (given the zoo-y-ness) I've ever seen. How our waitress managed the large number of people she did, and without seeming rushed or flustered in the slightest, I have no idea.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Came on a Saturday morning at 9:30am and we were seated immediately, service was very nice.  I greatly enjoyed my Brunch Des Cantons, perfectly cooked beans and various pork.  My fiance liked her Brunch Sucre, but wasn't blown away by it.  Solid Coffee and OJ included with brunch.  All in all a very pleasant experience.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Très déçue. J'ai commandé un breakfast cartet, supposé être composé de baguette, croissantS et fruits frais. Mon assiette est arrivée avec un croissant dur, deux bouts de baguette, une fraise, un quart d'ananas et un quartier d'orange. Mon amie a pris un croissant jambon fromage qui venait avec une salade. Elle a eu les mêmes fruits que moi, une pauvre salade triste et un petit croissant. Résultat on repart en ayant encore faim, et en sachant qu'on ne reviendra pas.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	J'adore le cartet! My boyfriend found this incredible brunch spot, and it's since become our favorite in le Vieuxport! Le petit dejuner est tres delicieux et l'ambiance est amical.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	More like 3.5 stars. I was fortunate enough to arrive a bit late by VIA Rail to Montreal so I did not have to wait particularly long for my table for one. The seating is communal-esque so get ready to get comfortable with the people sitting around you. \n\nI had the Brunch de L'Atlantique which is a salmon lovers delight. It had a smoked salmon scramble, a salmon cream cheese bagel, a salmon cake and a salad. The food was very good as was the coffee and the portions were very on point. However, the brunch was very much on the spendy side. I don't mind paying a lot for food - but there was nothing terribly unique about what I had which is why I'm knocking this place down a tad. This is definitely a convenient and nice place to brunch, but with so many options around - I would be more open to trying different alternatives.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Got the salmon sandwich with the soup of the day- watermelon and strawberry soup-- SO GOOD. 100% recommend to others and will come back!
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	I'm with all those saying this place is decent, but definitely overrated. But that may just be the spoiled New Yorker in me talking.\n\nWhile Montreal does a lot of things right, a hipster-like brunch is not one of them.\n\nBefore you jump down my throat for using the "H word," look around this place and pick out even one person who doesn't seem to take themselves waaay too seriously. Even our server barely cracked a smile the entire time we saw him buzzing around the restaurant. And the communal tables? Come on, hipster galore.\n\nAs for the food, it's great if you LOVELOVELOVE eggs - because they have about 20 different varieties of egg dishes - but pretty meh for everything else. During my most recent visit, I got the overpriced bagel with smoked salmon with a couple of fruit slices which were clearly sitting out for a while before being put on my plate.\n\nThe first time I came I got the Cartet brunch with an assortment of breads and pastries, which was, once again, just a-okay. Nothing to write home about.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Had a great brunch.  Try the Toscan: poached egg, ham, spinach, and muffin with fresh fruit.  Fresh ingredients in a great atmosphere.\nDefinately worth the trip on a weekend morning.  NIce selection of take out items, but seemed a bit overpriced for packaged up material.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	J'avais dans l'idée tous les restos de ce secteur étaient des attrapes-touristes, alors j'ai été très agréablement surprise de découvrir celui-ci. Nous y sommes allées pour le brunch qui était délicieux. Je vais très certainement y retourner.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Rules for visiting Montréal:\n\n1. Go to Le Cartet Boutique for brunch. \n2. I don't care what else you do after. \n3. Confirm that step 1 was done.\n\nWhen visiting a city, I love finding the places locals like to eat (doesn't every yelper?). I'm intimidated by all things French, but Le Cartet had such glowing reviews, I couldn't say no. Awesome decision. \n\nThe brunch menu has tons of variety, so whether you're in the mood for meat with a side of meat (ham, sausage, and bacon in one dish!) or a simple serving of fresh fruits, they have it. Prices are reasonable, especially after the USD to CAN conversion, so go nuts and get a mimosa while you're at it. \n\nService was great, our server was friendly and our food came out pretty quickly considering how busy the place was. I got the L'Atlantique dish which had a salad, an open face smoked salmon with schmear bagel, fresh fruits, and some apple chocolate chip thing I can't pronounce. I was also supposed to get a sweet potato fritter thing, but the server told me earlier they were out and would substitute by pretty much giving me more of everything else. Cool.\n\nWhatever the hell the chocolate chip apple thing was,  it was DELICIOUS.  Super moist and not too sweet, I would have preferred to have it at the end of my meal instead of the beginning, but I devoured it nonetheless. The salad was perfectly dressed and the everything about the dish garnered zero complaints from me. Like I said, they didn't have the fritter that came with my meal, so I'm not sure if the scrambled egg with salmon was a replacement or normal part of the meal. All the fruits were at the peak of freshness and sweetness, too. \n\nMy friend got the very simple scrambled eggs with goat cheese on toast.. and if I could give it ten stars, I would. If you can make something simple taste out of this world, that's a dang gift. All the right balance of salty, creamy, rich, crunch from the toast and sweetness from the side of fresh fruit made this so incredible that we're seriously considering going back to Montreal just to eat here again.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Le Cartet is my favorite cafe in Montreal! Very French. Beautiful communal wooden table in the middle with danish lamps hanging from the top.\n\nI made my first trip there on the July 4th weekend, and the famous toasted coconut bread was not available as the cafe was closed the previous day. \n\nI probably made this trip just to try the bread, although I'd never admit it. :) It was heaven.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	Over the new year week, we took off and escaped to the chilly weather of Montreal! We found numerous places for OK dining, but definitely the area you want to keep to is Old Montreal. This is where you get all things old and new and they meet right in the most unlikely of places. Somewhat hidden away from the grandness that is Old Montreal and off to a bit off a busier street is this place, Le Cartet. If I hadn't had my trusty iPhone indicating where I was versus where the restaurant was, i would never have found it on such a grand street. McGill Rue is a wide street with shops and restaurants. It's a street that leads directly to the Old Port. As soon as we walked in, I was comforted in the thought that we had stumbled onto a fabulous little breakfast joint. Up until then, we were at a kind of hit-or-miss with breakfast, so i was a bit uneasy that this might turn out badly, but I was delighted when i stepped inside. It's a nicely modern establishment with some rustic touches to the decor.  The menu is expansive and the portions are generous. My breakfast was marvelous indeed. I had le Brunch Sucre. And if that name is any indication, yes it was very sweet! I devoured the entire meal. It had everything from Crepes and fruit to French Toast. It was delicious! If you're in town, you should get out there. We were staying at the InterContinental and walked there, it was a cinch.
58APdML-PG_OD4El2ePTvw	My favorite brunch in Montreal.  There is an Atlantic plate of different salmon dishes that is up there among the best brunch that I have ever had.  Featuring a salmon cake, smoked salmon eggs, smoked salmon on a Montreal bagel and an amazing salad, I salivate thinking about it.  That said, I clearly love salmon and have never seen so many salmon options on one plate.  That might not be for everyone.\n\nThe service is efficient and the space is inviting.  Despite being a large group, we weren't in any way hurried.  Love it.
