YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	Eh, there's not a lot of stores here at this mall that interest me, but it is nice that there's a movie theater here and close proximity to good Mexican (La Fiesta) and Chinese food (Hunan East) so you can spend a night shopping, having some good dinner, and then catching a movie.  The main department stores here are JCPenny, Sears, and Macys.
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	The only mall worse than this one is Midway.  Just a bunch of people standing around, loitering, not spending money.  No bookstore, all the nice stores have gone.  Avoid.
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	I went here for a premier, I was so lost in the parking lot trying to find the theater I felt like a tourist lol. Typical west sider :). Once I got in everything was overwhelming, lines everywhere but no signage and no one knew where to go. Once it was figured out we went to concession. Very pricy even for theater standards. Movie was great, service was friendly and upbeat. I didn't go in the rest of the Mall just the theater,
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	This place kind of looked like a dump. The only reason I went there was to see a free advanced screening of Unknown at the movie theater. I was eager to leave quickly once I exited the theater!
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	There is so much to do at Richmond Town Square. You can go to the movies, go grab a bite to eat, or just go shopping. There are numerous stores to shop at, and the it is the perfect size to have a good adventure. \n\nIf you haven't visited and are someone who looks to be optimistic, spice life up and try new things, there really is a lot to do at Richmond Town Square. If you need a new phone, then visit Best Buy Mobile. If you are looking for men's formal wear, then visit Milanos Men's Wear. If you are looking for women's formal wear, then visit Ruby's. If you want to get in shape or exercise more, then join Planet Fitness. There are a lot of stores here. The possibilities are endless. It is a mall! And I'm happy I found a nice pair of shoes!
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	What a shame.  This used to be a vibrant mall with decent stores and pleasant food court.  Now the halls are bereft of major brand names except Sears, JCP, VS, and Macys - all of which are not quite shining examples of their name brands.  Where vendors such as Barnes & Nobles, Ruby Tuesdays, Mrs. Fields, and Starbucks used to be are now occupied by ghetto wear, discount wigs, cell phone bling, and vacancy signs. \n\nI mean Starbucks left for goodness sakes... a Starbucks!  Really??  I mean when was the last time you saw a Starbucks pack up and leave anything?!\n\nUnfortunately, this mall is well on its way into ghetto-ness - an unfortunate by-product of the decline of the neighborhood surrounding it.  It seems to be following in the footsteps of the once great Northfield and Euclid Malls, both which succumbed to the sprawling ghetto and eventually fell into major disrepair and closure.  I actually feel sorry for the poor retirees who I see occasionally walking through this place which I'm sure was much different in their heyday long ago.\n\nThe only reason I come to this mall twice a year is because I really like my dentist (Dentalworks in Sears) whom I've seen for years. But with the limited shopping choices and the downright ghetto feel, I don't do my shopping here.
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	Really the only reason to come here is for Macy's...but even that is outdated and a bit dirty.  Just come prepared that you aren't shopping in a brand new mall with all the latest and greatest!
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	This place is a disaster area.  The 3 main stores of Macy's, JcPenny's, and Sears are the only thing keeping this mall from becoming a thing of the past.  Wig stores, cheap jewelery, make-up shops each 10 feet, and perfume / cologne stores are pretty much the attraction here along with retail stores that you have never heard of.  But as a mall owner trying to make money, I guess you have to cater to your clientele accordingly.  \n\nI live in Richmond Heights and shop in Beachwood or Mentor.  I recommend you do the same. \n\nNow I do have to make mention that Hunan East and Taj Indian are good restaurants worth stopping into if you do go to the mall and want a bite to eat other then mall food.  Hunan is on Richmond and Taj is on Wilson Mills.
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	This place is well on its way to closing.  I used to enjoy walking this mall but now it has become a destination mall where I go only when I need something at Penney's and I prefer going to Great Lakes Mall in Mentor.  The Richmond Heights police blotter has shop lifting cases every week from Penney's and Sears doesn't do much better. I was at a city council meeting where someone said that the mall is safe - I don't agree.  I'd never go to the theater - they've had teenagers fighting in the lobby.  I hate to see the mall close but if it is still open in 5 years I'll be really surprised.  So glad that Beachwood and Legacy are close.
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	This is a small mall with no standout stores, and many stores with below average quality merchandise. This mall is too small to even take a leisurely stroll-browse through.\n\nOne positive for Richmond Town Square is that it has a large movie theater, but honestly, its probably the most expensive movie theater in the area, so it is not a huge selling feature.\n\nNot worth the visit, skip this mall!
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	This is a mall that has seen better days. Walking through it, one can tell it was once a nice place. Now, there is a lack of quality merchandise and name stores. The anchors seem to be a dumping ground for where the other area stores of the same name send their excess. Recently, Macy's announced plans to leave. Once that happens, I can't see this mall surviving long-term. What should be its saving grace, the movie theater, even has its issues (no fresh popcorn, it's brought in in garbage bags pre-popped) and there have been security issues at the theater and in the parking lot following movies. I only see matinees there on school days so I can avoid the areas wayward youth.
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	This mall has seen better days, after removing a lot of the good places such as Barnes N noble, Starbucks, Spencer's, Ruby Tuesdays, that place with the really tasty smoothies, and now recently FYE, the mall has become a shadow of its former self to the point that I rarely go there anymore. \n\nAbout the only reasons I ever come by now are for the movies, Gamestop, and for the Asian chao, pizza, and Osaka Teriyaki chicken.
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	This place has really taken a turn for the worst, when I was young it was THE place to be. Spencer's was the best and what "cool" kid wouldn't b caught without Starbucks in their hands. But now it's just a sad shell of the mall it once was when I was a teenager...  This is on the way to being Euclid square malls ugly twin sister...  Save yourself a wasted trip head to beachwood or mentor malls.
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	It's a mall, which has lost what it takes to be a good mall !!\n\nI go there only for movies.
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	Ordered a mattress 3+ weeks ago, paid over a thousand dollars for it. Still have no received it, I call and try to get updated but them get placed on hold for 30+ minutes on hold. Customer service is terrible, not surprised they are closing. Honestly wondering if I'm actually going to get my new bed or not..
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	I went to the Macy's here and it looked like a war zone. Literally, things strewn about everywhere. I was shocked to see it in that condition, since I've never seen a department store look that way. The inside of the mall has changed dramatically since I used to go there. A lot of vacant stores and a vacant feeling inside. After Legacy Village opened, I feel like a lot of the clientele migrated over there. This place might become the next Euclid Square Mall.\n\nIt's sad, I remember going here with friends when I was in junior high and spending a lot of time. Going into Spencer's was considered the epitome of cool back then.
YDf95gJZaq05wvo7hTQbbQ	I came all the way out here from the Westsiyeed to get the last two strands of LED C9 Christmas lights from Sears, well I'm glad I did because Sears closed about 4 weeks after this. Im pretty sure this mall is holding on by a thread if their main anchor just pulled out. You may want to check it out real soon before it is gone.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	First time visiting this location and ended up hang out for a while and smoking a cigar. This is a nice average Joe shop. Nothing fancy, just good cigars and interesting people
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	One of the best cigar shops in the country for a few reasons.  It's small-ish, but very nicely appointed and comfortable.  The clientele is extremely varied in demographics, and very friendly.  I always end up talking to people I've never met before.  The shop staff loves what they are doing and it shows.\n\nThere's a selection of the basic standard cigars everyone stocks, but then also a bunch of interesting and unusual stuff.  You can BYOB as with most shops.\n\nYou won't find a friendlier shop.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Awesome place with a huge selection of cigars. I was on my way to the airport to head home and had a couple hours to kill so I stopped in. Everyone was very friendly and helpful and I didn't have any problems feeling right at home. Very cool spot, I will definitely come back next time I'm in Phoenix!
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	I was on a trip to Houston, TX for the cigar festival. It was an amazing time with all my close friends. With out a doubt we ended up talking about shops across the nation and then Phoenix came up. I had just recently moved to Phoenix about 4 months before and asked some of my friends who make cigars and some reps told me I had to go to Baxters Cigars. Then know how particular I am and how everything is about atmosphere to me! From the second I walked in, Joe the owner, was nothing but happy I was there. It was like we have known each other for 10 yrs and I was just kickin it with a homie. I started to go to the shop a lot and became super close with Joe and Sug the shop manager! (All I gotta say about Sug is she's the god damn shit, and if you want to know about cigars ask her!!) ....... Enough said this shop is home and they are my family!!!
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Amazing selection, great atmosphere, cool local people and whenever my lady and I feel like smoking we always know Baxters is open.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Fm DC, staying at Biltmore,  friendly staff, comfortable, great selection, great prices,a main stay while staying in Phoenix.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	I have been coming here since Joe took over and the shop is great. The selection of cigars has been excellent but its the atmosphere that makes it. It doesn't matter your level of knowledge or smoking experience you will feel welcome here. The customer base is varied and you will be able to jump into a conversation anytime and feel like you are welcomed. Its a comfortable lounge with all the amenities you expect, the staff will go above and beyond to make you feel welcome.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Awesome shop.  Laid back and friendly atmosphere.  Owner Joe is a super guy and building a great business.  While I am only a visitor to the area, I will make it a point to go back to this shop.  I have been to 3-4 other cigar shops in the greater Phoenix area, and, to me, this stands far above the rest.  Highly recommended.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	This place is small but AMAZING! Great customer service, great lounge to relax in and Joseph is so knowledgeable an nice!  I'm sold! Definitely a place I will continue to come to for a long time and will recommend to all of my friends.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Very welcoming staff; you will feel at home even if you don't know anything about cigars. And great selection.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Great selection. Great prices. Owner is very friendly and welcoming. People hanging out are cool. Highly recommended.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Great place to hangout, with many amenities around the Towne and Country plaza. Great and friendly customer service with staff treating everyone with first class services, weather it's the first time or frequent customer. Complimentary coffee and water is a plus too!
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Found this cigar shop via Yelp while in the Phoenix area for spring training. Usually cigar shops are a little intimidating if you're a novice cigar enthusiast like myself. We came in expecting the same experience and it couldn't have been further from the truth. Joe warmly greeted us in the humidor and walked us through different cigars, what they are like and the history of the brand or individual cigar itself. It was truly a great experience and made purchasing a couple cigars a pleasurable and with confidence. Joe was even nice enough to throw in a cutter and some matches while was really valuable given that we were from out of town and didn't have those with us. Anytime I'm back in Phoenix I will be stopping in to add to my collection and hopefully getting some more teachings from Joe. I couldn't recommend these guys enough.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	This place is awesome. Had a great experience and they are very military friendly. I highly recommend it!
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	I've had the privilege of being in the cigar community for nearly 12 years.  This is hands down the best cigar shop in the Phoenix (the Valley).  Conversation is good, cigar knowledge is high, events are scheduled regularly, and whether you are shopping for an individual stick or a plethora of boxes you will be welcome.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Fantastic Cigar store.  Knowledgeable and friendly staff.  Extensive selection.  They had an event on Saturday with #Oliva Cigars that was the best I have been to.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Madie's cigar recommendations were spot on. Just visiting AZ for vacation but would definitely make this my spot for relaxing with a stogie if I lived here.  Thanks Madie for excellent customer service!
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	One of my favorite places to stop into. A friendly staff and the customers are awesome. Very much, a great place to relax and buy a great cigar. Joe and Nikki are very knowledgeable with tobacco and accessories. A must visit in the Phoenix area.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	If you're looking for a great relaxed cigar shop, this is the one.  This is the type of place where you immediately feel welcomed and the prices are very good too.  Joe, Nikki, and Rob give out spot on cigar advice from their large selection if you're not sure what you're looking for or want to try something new.  They even offer a military discount, which is a nice touch of class to go along with a complimentary glass of scotch or wine to enjoy with your cigar if you're going to hang out and smoke.  They even seem to enjoy staying open after their listed closing time so that you can continue enjoying that perfect cigar.  My wife and I feel like welcomed friends and not customers.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	You want a cigar, and you're somewhere in Phoenix?   Drive on over to Baxter's Cigars.  Even if it's a bit a way, I guarantee it's worth the drive.  Here's why:\n\nSelection: They have a good selection of all your standards. The humidor is well laid out and well stocked.  \n\nLounge: They have a great lounge that feels like your front room.  Not only is the staff quick to greet you, but ALL the other customers are just downright good people.  You're going to feel comfortable and welcomed the moment you walk through the front door.  Two big screen TV's playing sports, a fridge with water and soft drinks, and some really comfortable chairs are at your disposal.  It's not the biggest of lounges in the valley, but what they lack for in size is made up by simply being comfortable and cozy.  \n\nCustomer service: Let's face it, the Phoenix area is saturated with tons of places to grab and smoke a cigar.  What sets Baxter's apart is their employees and their attention to ensuring your time in the lounge is relaxing as possible.  \n\nBaxter's has a pretty cool vibe to it.  This is a great place for someone who's never had a cigar and just wants to check it all out.  Equally, great for someone like me that's been smoking longer than I care to admit.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Great service, atmosphere, and selection. Joe, Emily, and Nicky are very attentive and make everyone feel welcome. Baxter's has created a community for smokers. Their motto is "if you're smokin', we're open." It's nice to know that you can enjoy your stick without having to worry if they are closing five minutes after lighting it.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	My favorite local business. Quality sticks, quality people, and friendly to anyone who walks in the door. Stop on in, Joe or Maddie will make sure to take good care of you. To get the full Baxter's experience, I recommend smoking here.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Baxters is the example of great people and service. The owner (Joe) is the perfect host. Their love of great cigars and people make this the place to smoke and feel welcome. Their selection of cigars is excellent for all smoking profiles.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Was in Phoenix for a wedding and wanted to get some good celebratory cigars. Maddie and Joe hoped with some great cigars, hooked me up with great travel humidor and spent more time than necessary looking at cutters. I'll be back for sure and would send anyone looking for a great place to enjoy a good cigar.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Most friendly clientele ever. Staff fantastic great selection, if you want to relax, not be asked what you do for a living, where you live then this is the place to go. Open till the last cigar is smoked!!
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	THIS PLACE!  I hate to even write a review because I want it all to myself.  I refuse to give any details.  Ok.. .Ok... There is a lot of smoke and ash and cigars and blue flames.  Ok, that's all you get.\n\nI rate it 5 stars.\n\nthat's all I'm saying.\n\nGood bye.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	First met Joe at a local benefit for veterans; we talked for quite a while - he's a totally engaging cat.  I finally got around to visiting the shop (some 6 months later) and he remembered me, and the long trip I had to make to get to his shop - most of the typical "where you from," etc. that most let pass, he remembered.\n\nEnough about Joe, on to Baxter's Cigars.  This is a very laid back shop with a mix of lounge chairs and bistro tables that fit a wide range of styles.  The humidor is a good size for the shop and is well stocked.  Joe makes his guests (I hesitate to use the word "customer" because I felt more like a guest in his house) feel welcome and goes out of his way to accommodate those in his shop.\n\nOverall, this was a great experience and I highly recommend Baxter's Cigars.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	This place ROCKS. Used to live in the Valley and back this weekend for Spring Training (Go Giants!). Happened upon Baxter's the morning before going to the game for a pre-game cigar. Fortunate enough to meet Joe and (the smokin' hot) Madie. ;-)\n\nFriendly, unpretentious and welcoming. Will be returning to see the action at night. If you're looking for a place with a great selection of cigars and a place that you will feel welcome, regardless if you're a regular or a first timer, hit up Baxter's. You won't regret it.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Love this place.  Great staff and can always find a good conversation if you hang around to enjoy your purchase.  Everyone I've met there goes out of their way to be inclusive and welcome, which is pretty unique as far as I've experienced.\n\nThe one occasion I've had a less than stellar purchase, Nikki went out of his way to make things right.  That, as well as their great selection has earned them a regular customer.\n\nThe parking is a bit spotty at the moment, but should be better in a few weeks (I recommend parking in the north lot off Camelback until November).  Pretty good eats nearby as well, and good places to grab some snacks or beverages before heading to enjoy a good smoke.\n\nCan't recommend Baxter's enough!
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	the best shop in the valley.  Joe and Sug are friendly and helpful. Their prices are great, but the atmosphere is even better. One of the factors rarely mentioned that can make or break a cigar shop are the regulars. If the regulars are annoying it doesn't matter how great the owner and manager are, you won't want to stay. The regulars at Baxter's are awesome. You will come by for cigars but you will stay because of the people. Don't believe me? Follow Baxter's on Periscope (@BaxtersCigars) to get an idea what an typical day is like.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Just went in looking for a Christmas present and they were so helpful and kind and friendly! Knew their stuff and answered all my questions. Super convenient location too! Thanks again guys!
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	I really love everyone there. They always treat me so well and I always have a great time. They have such a great selection of cigars, a lot of new cigars that you won't find anywhere else. Joe knows a ton about cigars and will help you pick out a great cigar to try. Maddie is super sweet and she has a great palate as well.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	Walked into shop as a novice who bummed cigars off a friend looking to end that bad habit. Was immediately welcomed by staff who was very friendly. They helped me locate some cigars on all price ranges. Support your local shops, I will be returning.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	This a a great,welcoming place! Great folks with lots of knowledge. ...the best in Phoenix. A home away from home.
uUEMrhJiL1a1pCA_I1SU7Q	I love this place! It has a really welcoming and fun atmosphere, and the customer service is unbeatable! \n\nThe staff was extremely professional and knowledgable and helped me pick out the perfect gift for my boyfriend!\n\nI'm sure I'll be back soon!
kFtuYklkAIlmYw8RZAieGw	Mike and team at JAB did an amazing job with my wife's ring. They we very patient with us as we worked through several possible ring designs. They were very  helpful and presented us with many different options and we felt no pressure when making our decisions. It is the best jewelry shopping existence we have ever had and we will be our jewelry store of choice in the future! Thanks JAB team.
kFtuYklkAIlmYw8RZAieGw	Amazing people and amazing jewelry! Mandy and Michael have made our experience with JAB exceptional. My fiancé and I custom designed my sapphire wedding ring. Michael source seven different sapphires for us to look at and the one we found is phenomenal. Mandy did a wonderful job designing a one of a kind setting to showcase the sapphire. I've worn my engagement ring for a year and get compliments all time. We purchased both our wedding bands here too. We've made many visits to the store and are greeted like old friends each time. I could not more highly recommend JAB jewelry. \nKaitlin & Josh
kFtuYklkAIlmYw8RZAieGw	Bought my fiancé her engagement ring. Everyone was very helpful and considerate during each step of the selection process. From the band design to the final diamond selection. They are set up to provide as much or as little customization as you want. I ended up choosing a design from one their design catalogues after describing approximately what I was looking for. They ordered in several different diamonds in varying sizes to help me figure out exactly what kind I wanted on the ring. It was a great experience and I recommend going if you're shopping for an engagement ring.
kFtuYklkAIlmYw8RZAieGw	My fiancé said his experience with JAB was amazing. They were realistic with his price point and never tried to up sell him to something he couldn't afford. If you've shopped anywhere else you know this is a common trick some jewelry stores try. They helped him creat his dream ring for me. He is already excited to create our wedding bands with them because he had such a great experience! I too am excited to see what all the fuss is about during the band creation process. Thank you so much for my one of a kind ring! I love it!
kFtuYklkAIlmYw8RZAieGw	My fiance' has said that he had a GREAT experience with them through the ordering of my ring, When I went in for sizing, they were all very nice and accommodating. \n\nI did want to do something more there but no one ever followed-up - which is fine, since I didn't either.
kFtuYklkAIlmYw8RZAieGw	Bought my fiancée her engagement ring here. They were accommodating and dedicated to making sure I was totally happy with my choice
kFtuYklkAIlmYw8RZAieGw	I first heard about JAB on a friend's referral and I'm really glad that I did! I worked with 2 members of the staff to have a custom-design engagement ring made.  I spoke with Deborah who took down my initial details about what I was looking for and then I was contacted by Michael who worked closely with me to really hammer out the details so that he could begin working on creating a mock-up of the final piece.  \n\nAs many people already know either first-hand or second-hand, buying an engagement ring can be a pretty daunting process, let alone trying to design one.  Based on my description of what I wanted Michael helped to make it easy by first helping me to select the stone.  He was able to show me some samples of the type of stone that I was looking for and clearly explain the differences in the class, cut, clarity, and color of the stones that he was presenting and of course the price points.  Once the stone was picked it was a matter of selecting the band.  He showed me some samples of bands similar to what I was looking for and even designed a graphic concept image.  What we ended up with was a hybrid of an antique ring designed by an Arab designer and a computer-generated rendering of the concept ring that included some other details that I wanted.  \n\nWhen the "big day" came, my now fiancé was very pleased with her ring...and more importantly she said yes!  What made this whole process even more impressive is that I live out of state so all of this was done via many phone calls and emails with pictures back and forth.  Deborah and Michael literally looked at my fiancé's picture and worked with me to create a ring that looked like she was born to wear it.  \n\nI felt very comfortable during the process working with the staff at JAB.  I DID NOT find a bunch of salesmen rushing me to buy just any old piece of jewelry that would max out my budget.  I DID find a pair of sales persons in Michael and Deborah who took the time to understand what I want and show me pieces worthy of my time, my hard-earned money, and most importantly worthy of the finger of the princess wearing the masterpiece we created.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Count your fingers after they hand you a receipt.  I shop here mostly for meat. Started using their app for the Just for U deals.  3 out of 4 times they overcharge me (I don't get the coupon price or they give me the price and charge me for more units than I place on the belt).  I then have to wait at the customer service counter for a refund while the customer service person tries to convince me I was correctly charged.  Last time they gave me a cash refund but rounded down and stiffed me for the tax I paid. Nuff said.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Had a misunderstanding with a cake design when picked up a cake. The bakery manager really took charge and made my cake amazing and what i wanted!!!  Great place to get custom cakes!!!!!
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	General okay but no fry's when it comes to price and always have to wait in line. If no line you will probably have to ring a bell. Lol
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I sometimes stop at this Safeway because it is convenient. The reviews I have seen are correct, they need more staff (or) to staff at the appropriate times when it's busy. The lines are always super long and their customer service does lack. I do feel bad saying it lacks as the checker's are normally just as frustrated as the customers due to the never ending lines. \n\nI did also have a small incident with Pom Pomegranate Seeds (Pom is the brand.) I normally check all my expiration dates on anything that is perishable because there is nothing worse than pulling something from the fridge to eat it and it's gone bad. Anyway, I was in a rush and didn't look when I bought these and of course they had expired the week before. I will give it to the customer service desk, I took both tubs in that i bought the evening before and she promptly gave me my money back. Moral of this story: ALWAYS check your expiration dates. I was pleased with how she handled the return though, she did not give me any push-back which was a nice surprise. \n\nIf the management team can figure out the right number of checkers during certain hours this would definitely help their rating and my frequency for shopping here. \n\nSometimes a girl just don't have time to wait in long lines.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I keep going to this store because the customer service is spectacular for a grocery store. They go above and beyond to assist and help you out in anyway - they always ask if you need help finding anything - they offer assistance with carrying items - very knowledgeable of their store and where items are located.\n\nContrary to popular belief Safeway actually offers some of the best deals on grocery items I have seen compared to the other stores around my area such as Wal-Mart/Albertsons/Bashas etc. - They stay very competitive. I'm not sure how this store doesn't get a better rep? Customer service is really their number one goal, so if you have a problem don't be afraid to say something because they will help you solve it without belittling you such as what happens at most Wal-Marts. \n\n@Max C. - The checkout experience can be a little slow at times especially if you go to this particular store after 8pm and they don't have any self checkout lanes but they try to make the best of what they got. They also read your last name after finishing the order because it's trying to show you that they care, it's the little things that matter, if that is a bother for you then please head over to Wal-Mart.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	This place rarely has enough staff working.  Too many times, usually in the late afternoon on the way home from work, the longs are soooo long.  The rarely have more than 2 lines open meaning it is longer to get out of the store than it is to shop.  Never see the manager working nights to witness this operation.  I am afraid management is looking at sales reports and filling out the schedule based on numbers.  Unfortunately, customers are working out without buying anything once they see the long lines.\n\nHate shopping at this Safeway.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I avoid this place like the plague.  They are always slow in the check out area.  Rarely are more than 2 lanes open.  The parking lot is a mad house.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Horrible !!!! Only 2 lanes open and 5 people deep. I asked for another lane to be open and that took another couple of minutes total time in line 12 minutes. This is not the first second or third time this has happened it's every time I go in there. The management fucking sucks!!!!!! I asked to see the manager and he pretended to be oblivious to the situation.\nI asked him if he ever reads the store reviews and again he had "no clue" what I was talking about. This place is fucking ridiculous !!!! And definitely needs new management.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Terrible NEVER USE SAFEWAY GROCERY DELIVERY! \n\nMade an order, it never got delivered and per Maureen with Safeway Grocery customer Service my order was cancelled doesn't know why, but it was cancelled. Nothing they can/will do about it! TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. Oh and I was told yea we see you used a promo, you won't be able to use it again. Sorry wish there was something we could do....... NEVER AGAIN WILL I MAKE THIS MISTAKE! I will stick to shopping from FRYS food store and just do my order pick ups there! They don't let their customers down! They don't cancel orders for no reason, they have resolutions for their customers!!!
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	So it's not the most glamorous Safeway, but it's also not the worst. Its decent, average in size and close to my place! Friendly staff.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I really like this Safeway. It seems to be well organized and the selection of foods are pretty good. The last time I was here I got something from the hot case to eat for dinner and the fried chicken was okay. Nothing exciting. \n\nIt does almost never fail to be long lines when I am ready to check out...except for that one time I went after 10pm.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Good enough selection for just about anyone and overall a very clean place.  Service was very friendly and accomodated all requests.  Conveniently located near home nested with a variety of other stores in the same shopping center.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	This store sucks!!!!\n3's a crowd is crap. The only reason I went there because close to me\nI waited in line longer than I shopped\nRather drive 5 min down road to frys market place.   Nobody apologized for 15 min wait for a one item check out
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I can't tell you how many times I've been in this store when they had a line of customers at the ONE register they have open.  One evening I stopped after work and ended up in a line nine people long!  They did finally open one other register that time.  It's always slow, there's almost always only one register open and they don't have any self check-outs.  After 8 years of living here and coming to this Safeway periodically I think I'm done with this store.  There are 4 other grocery stores within 2 miles, don't waste your time here.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Absolutely HATE this safeway ..besides the fact that they are way understaffed & it's taken me as long as 20 min to check out ..they have the rudest cashiers I've ever seen ..and lazy !\nI only go here if it's a emergency! !!
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I want to say first I am not from his area and when I saw a Safeway I was happy because I know I have a Safeway card and I can use the just for you app. Not a problem. The place is beautiful.!! They need a better selection of food. I guess its just for that "area" but again it was not far from my new apartment. Now the Starbucks workers in there are very selective with who they speak to. Its like they were afraid or something. That automatically turned me off. Not to mention the cashier wouldn't even speak to and the girl who was bagging even walked away. I kid you not!!! I will go to the one that is even closer to me off Alma Rd their customer service sucks and that's all I need not to go. It was my first and last time. Safeway needs to do something about that.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	All the complaints about this Safeway being understaffed stems from the management being so awful to their employees. They have huge turnovers, people are hired and quit sometimes after their first shift. I did about three weeks of being talked down to, general rudeness, reminded that I could be fired at their whim...just an awful place to work. I found another job and purposely quit 10 mins before my next shift, it felt good.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	I love Safeway in all ways except this one lacks in customer service.\n\nSafeway offers coupons plus bonus $5.00 items on Friday's!\n\nThis particular location has several customer service cashiers that lack happiness as I call it. Regardless of the day or night, they never seem happy and pleasant. I also don't like the fact that I have to wait in line regardless of the time of day. They never seem to have enough cashiers on duty. Weekends are the worse!\n\nHope it's just this location and not the norm!
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Checkout experience is very poor.  Never enough lanes open and I hate their policy of reading the customer's last name out loud when they give you the receipt.  My last name is no one's business!  Please stop doing this!  Major privacy violation!\n\nOn a positive note, the organic produce section is quite good and the only reason I shop here.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	We really like this store, but the lack of checkers is really becoming an issue. This Sunday there were 14 people in line and one checker. It literally took 20 minutes in line. This is the case every time we go. Management is trying to save money on checkers, but they qill end up losing customers. It's to the point that we are thinking about changing stores.
n33Izvzk_z9_51H6NsQF-A	Every time we go to this location they're slow. Ordered two sandwiches from the to go sandwich counter. Only customer in line and it took the kid over 20 minutes. We went to check out in the express 15 item or less line and it took about 15 or 20 minutes for him to check out 3 people with credit cards and cash ready. I watched people leave my line, go into the regular lines and still beat me out the store. The clerk obviously did not care it was written all over his face. Went another time and just had to get something from the customer service counter and waited 7 to 10 minutes before I asked if anyone was working the counter and they finally sent someone my way about another 5 minutes later. Again people behind left in anger about the wait. Great store but the slowest staff and it's every time we go.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	This company was cheaper than two other companies I got quotes from. They were always really friendly and got my installation in in a very timely manner. About a week from accepting the quote. I am extremely happy with their service and they will be the company I recommend for artificial grass! The Installation took a few hours but they cleaned up everything and even removed two giant cement blocks that were under my dirt to make sure it installed evenly!
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Artificial Grass Masters was great.  Ricardo was so helpful and friendly that I was sold immediately.  I had a very small project but he seemed excited about it.  He demonstrated several different thicknesses of turf, the pros and cons of the thicknesses, and how the sun reflects off each grade of thickness.  He was very thorough and on top of his craft. \n\nHis crew was also excellent.  I can't believe how hard and fast they worked.  First thing they had to do was remove the gravel and they re-positioned it around the yard where it was needed.  The finished product is beautiful, firm yet soft to walk on, and neatly sloped away from the house.  \n\nI am very pleased with my experience with Ricardo, his crew, and Artificial Turf Masters.  I highly recommend them.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	We had a great experience with Artificial Grass Masters. They came highly recommended by my mom. Ricardo & Sean provided great customer service and their team of installers did amazing work.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	I've had my grass and pavers for almost a month now and I couldn't be happier!! Great product, very appealing, and no/easy maintenance. The installation crew showed up as scheduled and worked hard to get my back yard transformed within just a few hours.  However, the real star (and the reason I went with AGM) was Ryan, the salesman. He is truly a "Grass Master"!!  Ryan was super knowledgeable about all their products and very patient with my indecisiveness and helped me out tremendously with the layout and design of my now awesome backyard!! Ryan was professional, friendly, knowledgeable, punctual, responsive, and all around just FABULOUS!!!!!!
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Great customer service and installation for sure. They went above and beyond to make sure the install went fast. They have excellent communication skills and explain the importance of waiting if for some reason weather may delay. The operations manager Shawn took the time to inspect the job quality once completed prior to final payment. That means a lot these days.  \n\nI will now be using them for my pavers and landscape rock.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	I would give 5 stars to the install crew. I am giving 1 star to the company/management. I will change my rating with this company as soon as the owner calls my husband back regarding our install. \n\nWe had a sales guy out on June 17th and purchased that night. Our install was the week of June of 22nd. We called our sales guy two days after Install with a specific concern with the product (not the install). He came out a day or so later, examined it and took pictures. He thought it appeared to be a factory defect and said he put us on the schedule for repair. Fast forward to July 8th. Still No repair, no phone calls. We called July 9th and spoke with Tina. She asked us to text 3 types of pictures and some info. We texted immediately and she responded that she passed them along to the boss. \n\nFast forward to July 15th still no contact from company so we called again. Tina asked us to resend the pictures and info. My husband asked to have the owner call the next day. We immediately sent the pictures. I received no text response back. In addition to the phone call, I asked her to have the owner call my husband the next day and left his number again. It is July 16 and still no phone call. \n\nWe have a serious issue with a defect in the grass and no solution a month later. I am fully willing to change my rating if this company turns things around and addresses our issue affectively. Until then, I would not recommend them which is disappointing as they have BBB accreditation, Angie's list\nEtc...\n\nUpdate... Changed rating from one star to two because we are Making progress. Thank you Joshua for calling and getting some more people out here to look at grass. Still in waiting period. Will check back in and update again later
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Very easy to work with this company. They arrived on time to provide their quote; no pressure sales job. Price was very fair. They adhered to their schedule, and did an awesome job! I  will recommend them without hesitation.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	We had a small project and another company didn't even return our call.   Called artificial grass masters and Ricardo was excellent.   Everything was extremely professional.  The look and quality was so excellent that we had him do our entire backyard in another home!   We are definitely using this company for all of our needs in the future.  I have to say AGM is the most professional company I  have used in arizona.  The little details, the craftsmanship, the communication, the reasonable pricing.  A+.  Can't wait for our next project.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Great customer service , they did my backyard back in 2014 i felt now I had to post this review to mention how knowledgeable is the operation manager /owner he went above and beyond to do his best and to give us the best useful space in our small backyard . After couples of months we decided to add a paver to the synthetic grass they were always available to give us the best service . My kids and the whole family loved the job from artificial grass masters \n\n\nDefinitely I will recommend them more and more to each one ask about artificial grass
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	We got an amazing putting green for a great price! These guys worked hard and efficient and exceeded our expectations! I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to transform their yard!
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	We didn't have the minimum sf for them to install but they sell Do It Yourself Kits. The salesman came to our house and was not told that we needed a DIY kit. He seemed a little disappointed that it was a DIY kit. We ordered the grass and arranged to have it delivered either Wed. or Thurs. I asked if they would call first and he said probably. He said to call him if I wanted an update on delivery. The screeding arrived on Tuesday and they didn't even come to the door to say they were here and just dumped it on the street. I found it was here when I went to get the mail. I waited all day Wed and most of the day on Thurs and no delivery. I called the salesman and he seemed a little disturbed that I called him as he said he didn't have any clue about delivery after he turns in the order. He said he would check and get back with me which he didn't. I called the office on Friday and left a message saying I did not receive my grass. The salesman called back saying it was on the truck and should be delivered by midday. It came in a pickup truck and the delivery man was very good. He brought the grass in back and 3 bags of sand and I said where is the nails that the kit comes with. He said he wasn't told to bring any nails. After calling his boss he said he had to go back and get the nails which he did.\nI found out after looking up on their website I was supposed to also get a weed block fabric which I have not received. Your grass doesn't come pre-cut to fit your dimensions and you have to seam it. The kit does not come with seaming tape even though every lawn needs seaming. To me the seaming tape should come with the kit. It seems communication in this company is poor. They do not communicate to sales people nor do they communicate with their customers about delivery. I would not do business with this company again.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	I recently had the pleasure of working with this company. Wonderfully professional from estimating to install.  Couldn't be happier.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	If you're going to have artificial grass installed, look no further.  Ricardo was  knowledgeable, competent and very efficient.  He gets the job done at a reasonable price.  He works hard to please the customer and stays in contact throughout the entire process.  His crew even finished ahead of time.  You can't go wrong with Artificial Grass Masters and Ricardo....a very good experience and I love my back yard now.          \nCheryl Anderson
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Extremely pleased with my new yard.  It looks fantastic!  Thanks to Ricardo Santiago for making this a great experience. I wasn't sure exactly what I wanted.  He made very helpful suggestions and accepted final payment only after I was totally satisfied.  The crew was helpful as well.  I highly recommend!
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Can't get a return call, no show for two different appointments\nIf your project isn't big enough they will put you in the go away category
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	These guys are awesome!\nFrom start to finish I was impressed by this crews professionalism and helpfulness.\nWe weren't quite sure of the design for our back yard and Ricardo was a great help in solidifying our plan.\nThe crew quickly moved a whole backyard of bark chips and by lunch of the next day we had a beautiful grassy play yard.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	I shopped around extensively to replace grass in my back yard with artificial turf. Artificial Grass Masters was prompt in replying to my requests, helpful in answering my questions, and offered a fair price for a great product. The crew that completed the install was professional, efficient, and did awesome work. My yard now looks 110% better.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	If giving zero stars were an option, I would have. Ordering the grass was simple. A representative came out to my house and showed me their products. I liked what I saw so I ordered the next day, handing him a check for over $2000. Rather than having them install, we decided to do self-installation which was no problem for them. He told me once they cut the roll they would deliver it to my backyard on the side of my house. Several days later (on a Tuesday) I come home from work to see that this massive 15 foot long roll had been delivered without any notification. Rather than being delivered to my backyard, it was sitting on the side of my driveway. Frustrated , I called the person I ordered it through who told me he thought we could move it ourselves. He went on to tell me it weighed 1000+ pounds and took 7 people to roll it and lift it onto the delivery truck. He said though, that he would come out and move it with his buddies the following day (Wednesday). The next evening I get home from work only to see the artificial grass dragged a couple feet towards my backyard, unwrapped, and unraveled. Never receiving a follow-up call, I call the main number the following day (Thursday). The woman at the office tells me "it's not our problem since it was already delivered." She gives me one of the owners numbers to talk to, but a different owner ended up calling me first. He told me that he would get his men to come out Friday or Saturday and that he would call me Friday to let me know when they were coming. Friday comes and no call, no show. By Saturday afternoon, I leave a voicemail asking when they will be by. It is now Monday night. I have not received a callback and nobody has come by to move this 1000 pound piece of grass as promised. Six days after this was delivered without any form of notification, it is still sitting on my driveway waiting to get stolen with no means of moving it. Never in my life have I dealt with such a terrible company.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	I had my backyard done couple months ago and had a great experience with this company. Thank you for the great work your company performed. My backyard is now complete with the artificial grass and I love it.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	We had artificial grass masters come out a few months ago for a quote. Upon meeting the owner and talking over the types of grass they have, my husband and I decided to go ahead with the install. \n\nThey came out a week later and had the job finished in about 4 hours. So far, we've been very pleased. It looks so nice, really quite real looking. Our neighbors came over to pet it to see if it was. We've had the turf for 3 months now and are loving low maintenance and saving water. Highly recommend these guys!
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	We had AGM install about 950 sq feet of grass in our back yard along with a new border. Shawn did a great job explaining all of the options to us regarding grass types, lengths, and infill options. The project was started on time and completed within the time frame promised. The final product is awesome and I wish we had done this years ago. AGM has done four projects in our neighborhood and I know of at least two more that will be completed in the next couple of months.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Have now been waiting for over two months for repairs that were promised to me.  They will swear up and down that they will be out on a specific day to finish then no call no show.  Have been told that management will call to make sure this is taken care of, yet two months later still dealing with the king of let down Ryan.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	My experience with AGM was stellar. \n\nI contacted the company in late summer, got a quote and then called some other companies to check on price. They were competitive. I don't think my job was all that big (residential), but it was a little complicated. It involved separated areas, pavers, curbing, irrigation issues and a lot of aesthetic curves.\n\nThe project went off like clockwork. Materials were delivered, installers showed up, work was started and completed on time and in budget. I'm still amazed that they could do the work so quickly. Either the salesman, project manager and/or owner showed up to check on things every single day. The workers were courteous, thoughtful and they worked . . . hard. \n\nThe yard came out beautiful. I don't know if I could be any happier with the job. I can't find anything I don't like or any flaws. I actually want to spend time  just sitting on my porch to observe the wonderland and looking at the beauty they helped me create. Thank you EVERYONE from AGM. I would definitely recommend the company to a friend.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Couldn't ask for a better company to do business with. The work they did in my yard was amazing. Ricardo went above and beyond for us.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Job was promised completion in one day.  Took over a week.  Constant no shows and excuses.  Salesman promised it would be done to my satisfaction.  NOT.  Poor communication between salesman and installers.  Owner was very combative when I voiced my frustrations.  He did meet with me after pleading in my part.  I wanted to make changes.  He talked me out of it.  Additional repairs are needed.  The owner has now threatened to send my account to collections.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	We couldn't be any happier!  As long-distance landlords, we're always very concerned who we hire.  \nArtificial Grass Masters are very professional and detailed oriented people.   They were prompt with replies and precise with their estimates of time, materials, and cost.   Everybody loves the backyard.  We highly recommend Artificial Grass Masters.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	I live in Ahwatukee and contacted Artificial Grass Masters when I was considering replacing my home's grass area with artificial grass.  Our grass area is underneath large trees and includes a trampoline, both of which contribute to making it difficult for both the Bermuda and Rye (winter) grass to grow evenly.  The process from start to finish went smoothly, notwithstanding an intervening rain storm and flood (the largest in single day rainfall in recorded Phoenix history).\nFirst, I called their number and schedule a time for a quote.  The person I spoke with said that the person who would come would take measurements and then provide an oral quote as well as a written quote sent via email.\nMy quote was done by Ryan, who arrived on time, was friendly and knowledgeable regarding his products.  After taking measurements, my project was estimated at about 1100 sqft.  Because of the surrounding trees, Ryan recommended a medium length artificial grass (which he said would make blowing or spraying off of leaves and debris simpler), and a grass that had W-shaped fibers.  He said that the W-shape helps the fibers stand up better, which in turn helps the grass look better and stay cooler during the summer or in direct sun light because the air circulates more freely.  He also noted that there were large windows in my house that directly faced the lawn, and that parts of the Bermuda grass were dry or dead likely due to reflections off the window.  He said that he would not recommend installing any artificial grass without first installing window screens or treatment to prevent scalding the grass.  He also said to avoid leaving pool equipment, hoses, and toys on the lawn also to prevent scalding.  After measuring the grass area, he provided an oral quote, and while he was still there generated a PDF quote sent to me by email.\nNext, after discussing the quote and the project with my wife, we did two things: we scheduled a quote for installation of window shade screens from Sun City Awnings.  That project was done smoothly and promptly at a great price; we also asked Artificial Grass Masters for references for whom they had completed previous projects.  We were sent two people to contact, and I contacted one of them.  He was so pleased with his project (a professional grade putting green and sand bunker), that after talking for a few minutes, he emailed me 6 photos of his yard.\nWe decided to proceed with the project by calling Ryan and scheduling an installation day.  Because the yard already had grass, it also already had a concrete bumper surround, so no cement work was needed.  \nThe scheduled install day was Monday, Sept. 8.  That was the day of the major Phoenix rainstorms and flooding.  Ryan called me that morning to say that roads were closed and the installation would have to be rescheduled.  The next day, Sept. 9, a crew of about 7 people arrived and worked all day to remove the current grass and install the new grass.  By that evening, my kids and I were playing soccer and enjoying a flawless new lawn.  Only time will tell regarding the product's durability and usability.  But after thinking about doing such project for many years, I'm glad we finally pulled the trigger.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Wow! This is what I call outstanding customer service.  Mr. Santiago  gave us a courteous call 15 minutes prior to arriving to our home.  He was prepared and answered all my questions.  What was AMAZING was that he emailed me immediately all the cost of this project and it was shortly after he left!!!! His quote was the best and his customer service blew away the two other companies that came by earlier this week.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Sadly, I have to give this place one star. I was looking forward to potentially working with this company and giving them some business, however, the woman who answers the phone is not pleasant and snappy when trying to book appointments and makes it hard and frustrating to do so.  It did not leave me with a warm fuzzy feeling that I was working with a company that has my best intentions.  I hope that whoever decides to go with this company is more successful than I am don't get their heads ripped off by the cranky scheduler.\n\nWe are excited about working with some other friendly, nice companies that want our business and will make design our yard the way we would like it, in a helpful, friendly manner.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Where to start!. my wife and I could not be any happier with the completion of our artificial turf. We were in a time crunch and was told by all artificial grass companies, except Artificial Grass Masters, that there was no way to get the project done before Thanksgiving. It was our fault waiting up to the last second to order the job. This is when Frank Garcia stepped in and calmed us down. See, we are hosting 50 family members and really did not to want to have people hanging out in the back yard where the "real grass" was. Frank assured us that the job will be done on time, even though one day of rain stopped installation. the day before installation, all materials were delivered to my house and placed in an area that was not blocking my cars in the garage. The next day, at around 0700 hours, an army of installers arrived and got down to business. I was at work but was concerned that my two Great Danes were held up in the house and that I would come home to a "big mess". I sent Frank a message to see if he could make sure the gate was closed and then the let dogs out. Frank allowed the dogs to relieve themselves and then put them back in the house. When I got home, (5 hours after I had left for work) the installation was complete. Franks crew did a masterful job in cleaning up after themselves and even hosed down my patio! The crowning moment was when I noticed some one had placed our two trash cans back in the rear yard. I had put the trash out just before I left for work. it is the small things that are big to me. Frank came by and discussed the maintenance of the new yard and asked if I had any question. I told Frank we were impressed with their work, their efficiency, and their attention to detail. I am a Police Lieutenant and have given three referrals to other officers who are looking for a top notch business who delivers on their promises. To Frank Garcia and the installation crew, job well done. Kathryn and Matt A.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Ricardo and his crew are the best! Professional, courteous, and reliable. I started out with an idea which I added to several times. Ricardo was patient and so helpful in finalizing the idea. I could not believe the difference in my yard which was a nightmare and a disaster. The small job I expanded into a  bigger job and  mutilple areas (turf,pavers,gates,rock) was done in a couple of days. I won't use anyone else.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	AVOID this company AT ALL COSTS!!!! The sales rep Rudy can sell a good line but the follow through leaves much to be desired. WITHOUT MY PERMISSION or knowledge, Rudy had the workers come take out the curbing after I mentioned that I didn't like it and wanted to talk about options to change it. The owner, Josh, was extremely rude when I called him very upset that people had trespassed in my yard when I wasn't home and tore part of it out.  \n\nThey dropped the ball multiple times with the initial install date. Rudy would say that they would come out on a certain date. When I contacted him the day before to re-confirm because I hadn't heard ANYTHING about it, he told me it wasn't happening until the following week. \n\nWhen the install actually did happen, Rudy failed to provide vital information such as when materials were being dropped off. The result was that they dropped a huge roll of grass in the middle of the driveway and pavers/ sand in front of my neighbor's house instead of mine. \n\nThe actual product install was mixed. The pavers looked good, but the curbing was really ugly with a huge area flattened out. When I went out and told the guys installing it that I didn't like it, they said that half of the curbing was going to be covered. But it wasn't. When I contacted Rudy to tell him that a huge area was flattened, he said it was "for drainage"- which he failed to mention at any point during discussions. When I asked if there were other options for the curbing, he said he would talk to the owner and get back to me. In true Artificial Grass Masters fashion, no one communicated and I came home a week later to people TRESPASSING in my backyard and the whole curbing torn out. Eventually they came back out to install a paver border to replace what they tore out. But I SPECIFICALLY asked if that option would allow the grass to be secure. In short, it is even worse now with large gaps between the grass and border and large areas of the grass unsecured. Now I have to have someone else fix their work.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Great crew to work with.  They didn't mind the adjustments from original design and provided a first-class outcome.  They are meticulous in there work and they care.  Highly recommend Artificial Grass Masters to anyone.  I liked them so much, they'll be coming back and installing my putting green!!  Thanks everyone for your great work!
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Ricardo and his team are the best!  He came out immediately to provide a quote for replacement of our existing artificial grass and was far and away the cheapest.  The team came out a few days later and finished installing the artificial grass in one day.  The end product is beautiful- we couldn't be happier!  Highly recommend this company.  Great experience- very friendly and easy to work with!
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	After getting five other quotes to have turf installed in my backyard, Ricardo was able to price match and finish the job within a week of meeting him. He had some great design ideas and yet didn't push or try to up sell. The communication was quick and both he and his team were extremely punctual. \n\nHis crew was fantastic -- very efficient and left my place cleaner than before they arrived. I offered them a couple beers as they were finishing up because I don't think they took more than a 20 minute break over the course of nine hours!\n\nI'm very pleased with my yard and the entire process, so much so that I've already recommended them to a coworker (who just finished her yard with him) and another friend. When my parents move out to Arizona I'll definitely have them use Ricardo and AGM.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	The team was extremely talented and worked well with us as we created our backyard design.  We live on a large lot and had over 1100 sq feet of turf, 1000 sq feet of concrete and over 15 ton of rock put down. We also had a custom BBQ island installed, extensive drain system and a raised patio.  It has been 10 mths since the work has been completed and we have recommend this company and Ricardo to numerous family members.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Best turf I could find, and great prices. If you are looking into getting artificial grass this is the place to go. I had 6 different companies come out to do quotes, and let me tell ya Artificial Grass Masters is the cheapest, with the best product. Don't waste your time like I did, and just have them take care of the job!
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	The whole process was great.  Ricardo came out as scheduled and took his time explaining my options.  The installation was efficient and the crew was professional.  The product as of today is beautiful with no known flaws.
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	This company is the best! Unbelievable there is still actually phenomenal customer service and on time contractors in the U.S.! Ricardo sets the pace even for me...and I'm a physician! Don't waste your time getting estimates or quotes...CALL this company and deal with Ricardo first hand. I never write reviews but had to in this case!!!!
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	Excellent service, fast, efficient, reasonable price and process to install our artificial grass in front and backyard. Ricardo was professional and ensured the process was easy and precision perfect. He did everything he said he would do. He came to our house on a Friday. We received the estimate same day. Installation began and completed on schedule the next week Tues and Wednesday. Clean, beautiful perfect results. Highly recommend!
m06OZRFTaKKi6U0omfLq4g	We had an excellent experience with Artificial Grass Masters. After calling and receiving quotes from a handful of artificial grass suppliers, without question Artificial Grass Masters were the best at returning calls, scheduling time and most importantly listening and understanding our needs and applying that to their deep knowledge of the product. Our Project Manager for the installation was Ricardo and he did an outstanding job of assuring everything was done correctly and on time.  He was up front and on-target with everything he said and was exceptional at setting expectations.  The overall project wasn't without some challenges however when things pop-up they were resolved quickly and efficiently.  The end result, we have a beautiful yard plus we have already noticed that our water bill is nearly half the cost it has been in the past. I highly recommend using Artificial Grass Masters!
eW9vw2fE_6EuTWErZRo3mQ	Pour les amateurs de JDR jeux de plateau jeux de société et autres, cette place est faite pour vous.\n\nIls ont a la vente un vaste choix de jeux dans la premiere piece, et l'autre pièce est consacré aux jeux de plateau, et autres jeu de carte. Il y a régulierement des tournois de Magic, Yugioh etc.\n\nCe n'est pas ma place, mes ça reste une bonne place a connaitre pour les amateurs =).
eW9vw2fE_6EuTWErZRo3mQ	We were walking up St. Denis and saw the sign for this shop and just had to stop in! \n\nThe staff was welcoming, friendly, knowledgeable, and understanding of our limited French skills. There was a pretty great selection of fun geeky things and I will definitely have to come back to pick up some birthday gifts for the geekier friends/relatives. \n\nI really enjoyed the store's vibe--it was clean, well lit, filled with things for all different types of geeks and encouraged browsing.
eW9vw2fE_6EuTWErZRo3mQ	Small gaming store with friendly staff.  Decent  board game selection.  Not much for RPGs.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	They have the best selection of high end fashions in town. They also have amazing sale prices when you keep watch for the sales. Sometimes I find great deals at 70%off! The day after Christmas is the best time for the sales
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	Worst customer service I have ever received at a SAKS. The employee's there walk after you as though your looking to rob the place. Every time I come there, I promise myself it will be my last time. Hate that this is one of the only high end stores in Ohio.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	This store used to be my must-go in Cle. I rarely visit this Saks anymore. The selection of designer clothes, shoes, bags, in this particular Saks is awful compared to Saks in other cities. The women's contemporary section is especially lacking. The sales associates are rude, and completely ignore customers in the women's contemporary and cosmetics' department. I did, however, receive excellent service from a helpful Indian lady in the accessories (sunglasses) area. \nTen years ago this Saks was decent. It is disappointing that this is pretty much the only luxury store in CLE.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	It's the best in Cleveland. Keeping in mind that Cleveland doesn't have great shopping as a city. I went to buy perfume. Everyone was super. They often host large "designer events" with Gucci, Louis Vuitton and other designers.  It's the only super high end department store.  So if your going to shop there, you need a Saks card to get all your points.  This year my gift card was enough  to buy me a new Louis bag!
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	This Sak's sucks.  \n\nSerial.\n\nSomething seems amiss.  Oh, I see. Sales assosciates are slinking away from customers lest they be asked for assistance.  \n\nAssholes.\n\nSee the shirts and slacks I'm schlepping?  \n\nSale?\n\nSadly no.  \n\n*slams slacks down and slips away*\n\nSuck my balls.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	I went to sacks today on the 21st of September. Beachwood SAKS mens selection is less than extraordinary and I didn't see anything other than a pair of socks that were funky and cool. They were SAKS brand and $19.50. When I went to purchase them I couldn't find anyone and the checkout desk in the middle had no one there. Finally a gentleman in a brown suit came up to me and asked if I needed help. I told him I was ready to check out and he led me to the checkout desk. This is where it went downhill. I know it was 19.50, but he didn't even say a word to me, just sort of gave me a weird look and didn't say the total, I handed him a 50 and he gave me the change all without saying anything. He than started to walk away! I asked if I could please have my receipt and a bag and he replied "it didn't print because it's out of paper and you shouldn't need a bag for socks" in a rude snotty tone. I feel as if I was treated like I was shopping at Walmart, not SAKS fifth avenue. I was dressed in a t shirt and jeans maybe that was the problem. I will not be going back to this SAKS and will be shopping at Nordstoms and Macy's from now on.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	I was a little hesitant about going into Saks after visiting the one in Columbus but I decided to head in anyways that day. The store was a little barren that day (just like the Columbus store was when I visited it) so I assumed I would be trampled by sales associates, thankfully I wasn't and I was able to make my way to my section. Upon arriving I was looking at the sweaters that I was interested in when I was approached by a nice gentleman, Jim Bradlin. Jim helped me find my size, showed me the changing rooms and was patient while I tried on all three multiple times. We then proceeded to the register where he asked me about my line of work and told me about his experience in car sales, once it came to the usual department store credit card offer I simply turned it down and Jim was very courteous about it. I'm in car sales so I understand customer service and how long and boring the days can be sometimes but Jim nevertheless impressed me. I was planning on going down to the Burberry in Columbus to buy my fall/winter wardrobe but after receiving a nice handwritten letter from Jim I will be going back up to this Saks after finding out what days he works.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	I have been to this store and they completely ignore you. Ridiculous. I walked around dressed well with my big Louie in hand and they continued to not even look at me.\n\nI have called THREE times today trying to BUY a Ferragamo handbag and they aren't even answering the phone! Pathetic. \n\nI'll take my business elsewhere.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	I have been a loyal Saks shopper for many years.  Over the past year or so the store, along with the staff, has become so indifferent to it's customers that I have not shopped there.  I shop online, when there is something that I really want.  Beachwood Saks usually has to order the correct size/color,anyway.\n\nThe great sales associates of the past have all retired.  They knew how to take care of their customers.  The new associates, who are never the same, so it is impossible to establish with one of them, act as if they are working at a store with check out lines.  \n\nI tried to discuss this with the Operations Manager on a one hour phone call and it resulted in nothing he promised.  I then swore off Saks for another six months.  Being tenatious, I called again and reached a wonderful woman who has been working with me to reestablish myself with Saks.  I will give them another chance....I also called the Marketing Manager with whom I discussed being alerted to store events, which I was missing.\n\nShe doesn't seem to grasp the concept of calls or mailing notes/invitations to the established customers.  She is from the generation that feels email is all that is needed. The Saks emails announcing Store Events for the month do not have a proper link to the details of the event (fundraiser, tickets, appointment necessary?).  Where did the customer service go that Saks was known for in the past?  I believe it left with the wonderul sales associates that retired.\n\nI will try shopping at Saks again, thanks to Mary's encouragement.  I am still very saddened that the Marketing Manager doesn't  understand that some personal attention to valued customers would go a long way.....would a hand addressed invitation to an event or a call from an associate in that department be so difficutl?\n\nPerhaps, the new owners of SFA will encourage these practices once again and we Saks customers, who became used to this treatment will return and once again enyoy our shopping experience at the Beachwood Saks FiftheAvenue.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	I guess I'm rating this more on my experience at the MAC makeup counter than on my actual experience shopping Saks itself.  The people who work at the MAC counter are about 1,000 times better than any other MAC employees I have encountered.  As for Saks itself - meh.  I'm too cheap to shop here unless something is a billion percentage off.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	Best customer service by Eric, Mary and Katheleen!!! They always make my shopping experience great!
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	While it's nice that suburban CLE has one luxury brand store, this SFA is AWFUL compared to NY, LA, etc.  I am specifically referring to men's clothing, shoes and  fragrance.\n\nThe menswear dept. is extremely stuck in mid range labels. Much of the floor space is given over to trashy denim, t-shirts, Michael Kors, theory and Boss. Aside from a small selection of Zegna and SFA's own label knitwear (which is quite good, actually) there's little to tempt me. NOTHING at all like the 6th floor in NY or the freestanding Chicago store. It's a sad day when Sprezzy is let loose in a place like this can't find a single thing! \n\nAlso, the shoe selection is meager at best. Only a few Prada's?  \n\nMy main complaint with men's fragrances is also lack thereof. No Acqua di Parma at all in a store like this? Only a few selctions of Tom Ford private label?  Who goes to Saks for CK1? \n\nTwo positives; the Italian gentleman tailor is brilliant -- he altered a Zegna sport jacket to bespoke standards for me. Second, if you hit the 70% off sale days you can hit gold -- my more"basics" SO got a load of shirts and sweaters for next to nothing (70% off + additoinal 10 % for using a gift card) after the holidays.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	This is a great store! Much better than my Sak's in Pittsburgh. It is bright and fresh. The set up makes sense. The sa's are very nice and helpful.  \n\nThis place is a woman's dream with a great women's shoe, cosmetic and fragrance section. \n\nThey have a good selection of men's clothes and shoes as well.\n\nSak's Fifth Avenue Pittsburgh take notes.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	I would not recommend shopping here.\n\nThey have a fairly decent men's clothing section.  However, there is almost never anything decent on sale.\n\nMy one major problem, however, is the attitude of the sales staff at this Saks. EVERY SINGLE TIME I have been in this store, I have been completely ignored. I have even purposely dressed nicely (nicer than I might normally dress), and even then I have been ignored.\n\nWhy would anybody want to shop at a store that is way overpriced and be treated poorly? I would recommend heading over to the other side of the mall and shop at Nordstrom (much less attitude over there).
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	Saks always has a great attentive staff. They are there when you need them to be, but also when you want to just look, they won't bug you either.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	This is a really nice store at Beachwood Place Mall.  I don't go to the mall often, but my experience was certainly different since Beachwood Place put more security all across the mall. There are officers at all entry points. \n\nThe store is well organized and well lit. Good lighting is something I pay attention to. They have all kinds of high end brands such as Chanel, Gucci, Prada, etc.  Saks has the only designer boutiques in town.  The staff is clearly well trained. They appear to be very attentive and helpful. Several of them said, "hello" just as I passed by. \n\nMy ultimate destination at Saks was the dress boutique.  Although they have super high end stuff, the dress selection was lacking. The selection was not large. Truthfully, I might have been better off shopping online. \n\nI do like Saks when I am looking for something very specific. I will absolutely be shopping there again.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	I like this store, the staff are generally very helpful and the store is always well organized.  I have bought my furs here over the years and the staff in the salon are easy to work with.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	It's Saks.  They're kindov similar wherever one goes.  This one has been quiet lately, due to the downturn in the economy, which yields pretty good sales.  I picked up a bunch of things at 40% off pre-existing sales the other day.\n\nJared was my sales guy, and he was friendly and down to earth.  Some of the other sales guys seemed a little less happy since I think I was the only customer in the section at the time...\n\nDid you know there are drinks in Saks?
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	The customer service at Saks has improved recently. Happy to see progress!  I recommend that you find 1-2 good sales associates and stick with them when you shop.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	I LOVE SAKS! And I LOVE my local Beachwood Saks. I can't believe anyone says bad things. I really feel like they've been working hard to erase the snob attitude from 10 years ago. I think they are super helpful. Not sure about the Men's dept. but I have found all women's dept wonderful. I was actually pleasantly surprised when I walked in with a bunch of online returns and a super nice lady helped me return everything when she could have turned away to sell something. Lots of good people there. Just talk to them, you'll see how nice and helpful they are!!!
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	Being a former Saks employee I was very disappointed with the customer service I received here.  The associate was very nice and helpful, however the manager I believe her name was Kathleen was very rude and seemed to talked down to me because I was not wearing my upscale outfit and was not dressed as a typical saks customer.  I was VERY disappointed.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	This place rocks best place in Ohio to get clothing. They have a Louis Vuitton And a Chanel!!
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	Many years ago Saks Fifth Avenue Beachwood lost my business.  I continued to shop at the NYC and Troy Michigan locations.  Then a very kind and lovely associate gained my business back.  Well, it seems that Saks Beachwood has yet again lost me as a customer.  The sales staff have become rude and nasty AGAIN.  The behavior of the sales staff amazes me....YOU ARE SALES PEOPLE, WE THE CUSTOMER PAY  YOU WITH OUR PURCHASES.  Like most people, I am not spending as I once did, but I still managed to drop $5 - 7k  at this location this year.  No more, I am done with SFA, and my credit card will be closed.  Again,  you are sales people, you are not Dr's, JD's, CEO's, etc.....get over it, you sell clothes, perfume, accessories, etc.,
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	You think for an upscale store that they would have nicer restrooms.  Or at least ones that are cleaner.
8E5l83iGubQmtivb24TL_Q	I like this Saks! It is much better than Nordstrom in the same complex. It is also much better than the Saks in South Coast Plaza, people!!\n\nHandbag selection is pretty good here. There is both a Chanel and Louis Vuitton boutique. Prada has its own corner and there's always some nice Miu Miu bags on display. Coach collection is pretty sad, still.\n\nDecent shoe section as well- I saw 2 Chanel flats on sale today for $359!\n\nI also like the contemporary women's section, which is actually OUTSIDE of Saks proper on the 2nd floor. They have a pretty good selection of stuff (lotsa Juicy couture, designer jeans that take up entire corner, Theory, DVF, BCBG, etc). However, I don't see many good sales going on here. To me, the SA's have always been less than nice too.\n\nDo not be fooled- even though it's Cleveland and the economy is in the dump, I called the DAY OF a presale and was told everything was sold out! Gross.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	Okay just got 2 fans and 1 light and was rush out of the store by the manager on duty. Got to say not real happy with them the young woman forgot our military discount and stated oh sorry but you can come back tomorrow or go to another location and they will do it for you. Worst location for customers satisfaction will never be back.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	This lowes is very nice. I went in for a freezer I saw on line, they didn't have a new one but they did have one that was returned from another customers brand new. There was a dent and I got a discount. Unfortunately after getting it home it didn't work. I came back in a few days later to exchange it and I ended up getting a brand new one. The exchange was easy, the team members were kind, patient and helpful.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	Top 10 worst customer services ever this was my first time in Lowes and all the employess walked right passed me not even a "hello " or asking if I needed any help or if I had any questions they just looked at me as if I was going to steal something or walk the other way  I've never experienced such horrible service in my life not even at homedepo at least the employess there have the courtesy of saying hello when you walk through the door . I hope no one else who plans on shopping here has to get the same horrible service as I did I'm beyond offended .
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	Stopped in today to get a quote on a custom linen cabinet, talked to one employee in the custom cabinetry and he couldn't help us because he wasn't on shift yet the other employee had "entered 5 into their system" and couldn't help us so they called a Linda to help us, after waiting for over 15 minutes for Linda we decided to leave since it was the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced in a big box store! Neither of the employee's we spoke with seemed to care that we decided to leave. I will not spend another cent in this store due to this experience.\nI would give them zero stars if possible!!!!
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	This Lowe's has provided my husband and I with amazing customer service. Reed, the assistant store manager, really knows how to keep his customers coming back! Reed you handled a terrible situation and turned it around for us! Lowes at Happy Valley has our business, hands down, for all our home improvement needs! Thank you Reed!
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	I am getting more and more disappointed with this store's customer service, or lack there of.  The first time, I was inquiring about kitchen cabinets.  The sales person sent an email to their cabinet person, to order me some samples of wood colors.  Several weeks passed by without hearing anything or getting an email response...so I decided to take another route in my kitchen (added door knobs/\nhandles instead of replacing the cabinets).\nThis next time, I paid $35 to get an estimate to move and hang a ceiling fan in the living room.  I was told it would only take 24-48 hours to get a quote.  After a week, Lowe's finally called back.  Now they're quoting almost $400, when the standard install is $100.  This just seems astronomical to me.  I have to wonder how much Lowe's is making.  This makes me VERY skeptical about having anything done by Lowe's in the future!
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	When I went to purchase an expensive fridge their customer service was great. However their service and quality stop at the door after you leave. They delivered us a faulty fridge that broke after a few months & I have now been out of a fridge going on 6 weeks. Living in AZ being without a fridge for any length of time is not fun, however they do not seem to care to have any rush in giving me a new fridge even after a specialist came to see the old one and comfirmed that it was faulty. Very disappointed in their customer care team. Never again will I be buying appliances from Lowes.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	This is a very nice Lowe's! From the front entrance, there are many plants for sale and the outside is clean with great curb appeal. On the inside, aisles and departments are clearly marked with large signs. The inside of the store is bright, clean, and very open. My husband and I went in to get a copy of a key made for our car. The associate was very friendly and literally finished making our key within one minute! We also looked for a garage door opener but, unfortunately, they did not have the brand we were looking for.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	We ordered a microwave since ours died right before Thanksgiving. We placed our order on November 23rd. Their charge to deliver to our home was ridiculous so we agreed to come pick it up at the store. We were contacted the next day to confirm the order but told our microwave wouldn't arrive until December 7th! I asked why it would take so long and the response I got was "I don't know". So, we struggled through the holidays without a microwave. December 7th arrived - no microwave. I called to check on the order and heard it had only shipped out the day before and would arrive "soon". I asked what "soon" meant and heard "I don't know". I asked to be called back with a definite delivery date. I was called today to hear it won't be here for another week. I asked why it was delayed - the response was "I don't know". I asked why I wasn't contacted to be told it was delayed - the response (you guessed it) was "I don't know". I asked if there was anything the store was willing to do to make up for the inconvenience and terrible customer service and was told "Well, I can't make it get here any faster". TERRIBLE customer service - I will NEVER shop at Lowe's again.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	I love this Lowe's. It's very clean and I've always found the employees to be very helpful.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	Run as far as you can from this store. The customer service is the worst I have ever seen! The clerks are helpful for what they are trained to do but there are not enough of them (trained). I have never been a Home Depot fan but you can bet I have just changed.I have been waiting for 17 mins for someone to adjust a quote so I can pay for work to get done. This store is understaffed with people able to do more then one job. Never again!
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	I have received service here that is so outstanding I am sooo sold on Lowe's!\nThey are extremely customer service oriented, and if you buy a defective product from them they will actually make good on it by either fixing it or giving you another.\nI've never had this type of service from anywhere else really.\n\nCustomer of Lowe's for life, and I bought all my ceiling fans, Levelor blinds and so many thing from them.  Great store here!!!!
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	This one, unlike the one on Scottsdale Road, exists - and it is clean, friendly, well laid out, and nicely stocked.  I still don't like the florescent lights at any Lowes as they give me a nearly instant headache, but at this one I don't have to wander for 20 minutes to find the lighting section so I'm in and out in no time, usually with exactly what I need.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	Great online pickup service. They get my items quickly! Sometimes within 10 minutes of ordering online. Sometimes there isn't a person ready to help right away when I pick it up, but more times than not, someone is ready to help.  And, this is preferable since online ordering exists with store pickup to expedite the purchasing process.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	We recently moved and needed to purchase a new washer/dryer.  Because my brother is a frequent customer at this location, he put me in touch with Chelsea, an employee at this location, to help me out.  I didn't even have to go in the store because Chelsea was so helpful... we spoke on the phone a few times and she emailed me some suggestions (and specials) based on what we were looking for.  Needless to say, this saved us a ton of time.  \n\nOnce we decided on what models we wanted (Samsung by the way), Chelsea facilitated my payment by phone and delivery literally happened within 24 hours.  We were thankful for this because we'd gone over a week by this time without doing our laundry!\n\nWe are enjoying our new machines and are thankful to have worked with Chelsea at this Lowe's store.  Hopefully we won't be in the market for any more major appliances for awhile, but if you are, I highly recommend calling or visiting Chelsea!
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	The employees are knowledgeable.... If you can find them in the store. They all seem to hang out in the front by one of the main entrances. I never seem to find them in the bathroom fixtures section or in garden which are the areas I tend to need help. This location is definitely one of the cleanest I have seen by far though, which is surprising for a hardware store.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	This isn't the closest Lowes to me. But I do like it the most out of the ones around me. It is always clean and well stocked. The parking lot setup is perfect, clean, and easy to navigate. Returns are always quick at this one. Bathrooms are the nicest I have seen at any home improvement store.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	Well, walking into this Lowes.. much cleaner then other Home Improvement stores. More employes around to assist, which was a nice change. \n\nWe spent almost 3 hours in the home decor department, which made me hate life. Upon arrival, there was a guy around who tried to assist us, however, he clearly was not trained for that particular department. Good try my friend. We had to wait about 30 minutes or so until the guy that normally works the home decor department came back from lunch. We were told that he was going to page us over the intercom when he was back. That never happened. 2 life fails in one moment. \n\nWell, short angry story later... 3 hours wasted, 3 life fails. We finally walked out making the purchase for the project after the department manager came to help.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	I went in to this Lowe's after having a horrible experience at Home Depot,  I went in the store after shopping online and chatting with a representative.   I purchase a washer which I was in stock and was held for me till I could come back later in the day.  Lowe's not only had my invoice still in the computer, I was rang out with no problems using a military discount even with the item being on sale ( Home Depot does not let you do this),  Had help loading the item in to the truck and off to install at home.  I could have had it delivered in a day and the old one hauled away.   Every employee who walked by me while shopping in the store asked if I needed help and the appliance employees were great.    I now a list of items I will be purchasing in the future from Lowes
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	The hardware store designed for women.  Phenomenal service and selection.  The patio and garden departments are amazing. Lowe's also boasts the best light bulb selection anywhere.   My experience here was almost, I repeat almost, as fun as going to Nordstrom.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	I like their lumber better than Home depot and their Hurricane ties. Nice store with good selection
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	I never thought I would give a Lowe's five stars, but this place is great.  It's close to my home, convienent parking, good prices, good selection and the staff is very helpful and knowledgable.  What more could you want?
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	The best Lowe's I've ever been to! The staff is knowledgeable and friendly! They are eager to help you! Great selection, clean, and spacious! Cannot say enough good things about this Lowe's location!
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	Paint department is always helpful. My company buys a lot of paint and hardware tools from Lowe's and paint really stands out. They always work hard to help me find what I need. \n\nHardware is often out of common nuts and bolts or tools. A bit frustrating and I usually go online to Harbor Freight.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	Staff is always so friendly and helpful. When a price comes up wrong at the register they are great at coming up with a solution to fix the situation every plant looks well maintenance even the clearance ones that normally look pretty bad. 10/10 recommend this location
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	I went into this Lowe's yesterday because I just recently bought a new home. And can I just say the customer service at this location was amazing! I have never had so many associates genuinely offer help and truly wanted to assist! It was so refreshing and I will definitely be back to this location! Everyone was top notch and I didn't see one employee slacking off at all! Everyone was ready to answer questions, guide us in the right direction or help with ideas! It was wonderful! Shop here! You won't be let down!
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	Great customer service and great deals on all the fans and vanities for our new house.  So organized and clean.  Not overly swamped with people either.  I will be back for my household needs.  Thanks Lowe's!!
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	I like the convenience of this store. They do have an instant key center. The prices seem to be better than most other Lowes. They do however honor Veteran's discounts and the employees are more apt to help you here.
4irpCt5a5Sa72kIGyTmJ1Q	Friendly with large selection. A bit cleaner than other hardware stores but their appliance selection isn't as complete as the other major hardware store.  The tool selection is nice and they have a wide variety of stuff from the cheap to professional grade.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	This was one place I wanted to visit on my trip to Edinburgh so that I could compare it with my local Deli's. Whilst it is impressive it wasn't as bit as I'd imagined so didn't stock the range of goods I'd expected.\n\n\n The bread was very fresh so we treated ourselves to a mini packed lunch to take ont he train home, this we managed to do for less than £8 for two people which wasn't bad.\n\n\n One thing I did notice was that the brand of cream they sell is the same as my local Lidl's.\n\n\n I'm sure while we were in there Clarissa Dickson Wright was there too so nice to see the owners pop in.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	AMERICANS and ITALIANS who appreciate lasagne that has not been pre-cooked... this is your savior. Not even Lupe Pinto's my favorite little shop in the universe has lasagne that has not been pre-cooked. \n\nI will not explain myself to you UKers who say "But who cares if it's pre-cooked"? "It's the meat and cheese that matter""What is the difference?" or my favorite, "I can't taste any difference". You and your bad opinions are wrong. You know what? I feel the same way about instant mashed potatoes (not true, but using for effect) - how do you like THAT? \n\nValvona and Crolla has many, many good attributes, which everyone else has already written about. So I am here to tell you about Valvona and Crolla... the only place in Edinburgh to get un-pre-cooked lasagne.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	valvona & crolla on elm row (top of leith walk) is the flagship shop for this long-established, edinburgh-based italian family business.\nthey have one of edinburgh's finest selections of italian groceries, cheeses, antipasto, oils and wines. plus a whole lot more yummy stuff too long to list. there is no doubt that shopping here will bring you great foodie joy (including great wine joy).\nsadly this passion doesn't seem to extend to coffee.\nat the back of the store is quite a large and pleasant cafe that does alcohol as well as food. i had a flat white which was too hot and weak. you know this also means that the milk texture was non-existent. i've had this same experience several times  such a shame when the food and wine is so great.\ni continue to be amazed by folk who clearly know what they're doing with food and wine but who don't consider coffee with the same rigour. this isn't confined to v&c by any means. plenty of excellent, well-reviewed and highly regarded restaurants are the same. much coffee evolution yet to occur in our tea-loving part of the world!\nhttp://edinburghcoffeelovers.blogspot.com/ twitter: @edinburghcoffee
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	As The unimpressive Leaky Cauldron in Harry Potter hides a magnificent and bustling street of magical activity, so a small, unobtrusive shop front in Leith Walk can conceal an Italian cavern of such wonders that even Rowling would be hard pressed to dream up. \nValvona and Crolla is a huge, cavernous shop with walls lined to the ceiling with Giant pasta, herbs, sauces and everything imaginable relating to Italian cuisine. Now, cooking for me is a simple, economic exercise. I have only ever once bought brie, and that was because, weirdly, it was cheaper than the cheddar. The cheese counter in this lovely shop, however, is enchanting, and does not need to be seen by a hungry or culinary adventurous eye. It just needs to be seen. \nWinding deep into the shop, you will come across baskets of succulent muffins and pastries, glistening with divinity, and a café, whose hot chocolate is exactly that: chocolate warmed and melted, served with milk. Heaven.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	I have fond memories of visiting this shop as a child. My mother went to school with the owner Gloria who was lovely. I went with another italian friend a few years ago and did not find the younger generation friendly at all. The shop is now vastly overpriced and i never met an italian who could not make good coffee. Disappointing
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Overpriced but interesting shop.\n\nThings to buy here \n\n- chocolate donuts, they use a real ganache and they are only £1.25, rest of the pastries are crappy italian versions of french things.\n\n- some of the fresh vegetable can be a real steal, sometimes they have purple sprouting broccoli for like £2.50 a kilo!\n\nEdinburgh institution so probably worth a visit. I feel lucky Edinburgh has this but hardly shop here apart from the aforementioned products.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	A cute little Italian gourmet shop. Totally unexpected to find in Scotland. Good variety of wines and beer too. Cheeses, meets, pasta, sauces. They have it all. With a little bistro in the back. Outside of the more touristy areas and not as easy to find but definitely worth a visit!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	My wonderful Grandmother often hops on the train to Edinburgh to take her poor student granddaughter (me) out for lunch. Valvona and Crolla is the top of our list for an afternoon of playing ladies who lunch.\n\nThe menu covers a range of Italian dishes that are far more exciting than your average pizza and pasta affair, the range is so vast that it will satisfy even the pickiest of eaters. The food is fresh, delicious and well priced. But the real icing on the cake at Valvona and Crolla is the desserts. You must save room in that already satisfied belly as you will not be disappointed. I insist you try the Chocolate Torte, which is in fact a little slice of heaven served beautifully on your plate. The last time we visited my dear old Grandmother charmed the young waiter into giving us the most gigantic slices of Chocolate Torte I've ever seen, I swear my thighs are still carrying it around.  \n\nBut it is so worth it. The combination of the great service and fantastic food make Valvona and Crolla well worth the visit (and the calories).
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Valvona and Crolla is just one of those Edinburgh places you have to visit. It's one of the oldest delis in the UK and is still family owned. Long and thin, the whole places is an absolute assault on the senses - the moment you walk in you can smell the cheeses and sausages and bread and biscuits and coffee all piled on shelves that reach right up to the high ceilings. There's a giant wine section; gifts; fresh produce; a bakery section; shelf upon shelf of pasta Really good-quality stuff, with staff who miraculously seem to know everything about the place, despite its size and complexity. Things for students to look out for: free bread samples, so that you can try the delicious balsamic vinegar and olive oil. There's also a rather posh cafe right at the back, which I've only been to once and long ago, but I can still remember the mouthwatering pastry I had. A word of warning - for Christmas presents go now - the narrow walkway just gets too busy in December!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Was delighted to get gift vouchers for here for my birthday and had so much fun spending them :0) \nI bought their own brand prosecco which is delicious and highly recommended. Also stocked up on pasta, olive oil and chocolate.  \nThe shop is so nice to just have a wander around.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	An amazing find!  It was clearly our favorite place to eat while on vacation in Edinburgh for a few days.  I did not realize how much of an institution Valvona & Crolla was.  We were so excited to see , that we ended up visiting two other locations and ended up eating at Valvona & Crolla 4 times in 8 days!  \n\nI had a meat and cheese plate for breakfast and it was incredible.  I also had the Papardelle Ragu (at the Multrees location) which was also very good.\n\nThe service at all locations was outstanding.  I've seen some notes about the service being slow and I don't know if that's an American thing.  Most times I've visited Europe, every restaurant let's you sit and enjoy rather than having you feel like they're pushing you out the door to seat the next set of patrons.  Similar to other restaurants, the only time it is "slow" is when it comes to the check.  I would highly recommend Valvona & Crolla to anyone visitng Edinburgh.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Watch out for the low flying cheeses and sausages.\n\nIm not sure Health & Safety would approve !!!\n\n;-P
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Love the rosetta rolls and the bombolini. Some of the food is very pricey but you get what you pay for, I suppose. I tend to buy one or two very special things to accompany other bits and pieces from the supermarket. It is somewhere that quality matters.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Valvona and Crolla is a real Edinburgh institution. I can remember visiting with my parents when I was little and being fascinated with the sites and smells inside this place.\n\n\n This a a real old school delicatessan selling a huge variety of stock and anything you could possibly want from Italy. Their cured meats and cheeses are mouth watering stuff, but do expect to pay for the priviliege. They also do freshly baked breads and rolls which are so lovely. Then there's their fantastic selection of alcohols and liqueurs, if you're looking for something obscure you'll definitely find it here.\n\n\n I can understand other posters when they suggest it's crampt and busy, but i think this adds to it's charm and makes it a perfect place for people watching.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	I really like this place. Great variety of cheese and deli meats. A little pricey but good quality foods!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	What a great selection of Italian specialty goods. Being Italian, there is nothing more frustrating that not being able to find things like polenta flour in an entire city of grocery stores. If it's Italian, chances are they'll have it. Valvona's baked goods are RIDICULOUSLY good, and their cheese selection is quite impressive. Whenever I throw a dinner party, this is my go-to place for things like wine, cut meats, cheese, and other hard to find specialty packaged goods. My ONLY complaint (if you can call it that) is that they don't have a wider selection of cut meats....But what they DO carry is top notch quality. It also helps that Mary (the owner) is as sweet as their flourless chocolate torte (a must try for anyone who loves chocolate).
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Valvona & Crolla has two stores in Edinburgh I think  1 is at the top of Leith Walk and the other is next to Harvey Nicols. I have only been to the one at the top of Leith Walk and love the selection of Italian goods on offer in their deli section. It also has a café however I don't think this offers good value. While I love the selection of stuff in their deli, I have to say the prices they charge are way over the top. All in all it is a great delicatessen but FAR too expensive for what you get.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Recently had a lunch there, I ordered the scallops which was brilliant! Since I took a late lunch at six o'clock, I didn't try other dishes.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	This has to be Edinburgh's number one deli. This little place is absolutely packed with sauces, wines, cheeses and meats. \n\nThe front of the shop is quite narrow and is filled with Italian foods and has fresh meats and cheeses on offer at the deli. Behind the deli the high wall is dominated by a whole range of bottles. Indeed, it is so high that the staff don't use a ladder to get a bottle down, but instead use a gripping device....I would be very nervous indeed using that, many bottles would end up smashed on the floor if it was me! \n\nThe shop is full of tempting smells and the smell of fresh bread always leads you to the back of the shop. And there you find a large selection of Italian wines, a lot of very good red wines. \n\nA good bottle of red, with some fresh bread and cheese...I would say that's a good shop!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Valvona & Crolla is an absolute delight, it's a throwback to the past in quality and variety of products including freshly made breads and sweet baked goods, organic veg, an impressive wines and spirits selection, specialist cheeses and home made take away food such as soups and ravioli. There's also a lovely cafe (with stunning carrot cake) and a gift shop selling a variety of luxury and kitchen and household goods as well as a book section. V&C is a very pleasant assault on the senses, the best deli in town and it also doubles as a Fringe venue in the Festival, it's well worth a visit for any visitors to town.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	If you are looking for the most expensive espresso macchiato in town, look no further - £2.45. I had balked when Peters Yard raised their macchiato prices to £2.20, but now I can see theirs is actually a steal. I have to say that the prices made it a bit hard to enjoy this cafe, which is a very pleasant space - wood floors, high ceilings, pleasantly and simply decorated. But I am just not convinced that the high prices are worth a trip across town - I did say most expensive macchiato, not the best I have had. There is table service, which makes a nice change from most cafes around town, but the service itself was a bit inconsistent. I was not greeted by any of the three servers behind the deli counter when I walked into the shop. Nor was I greeted by the two employees behind the register as I entered the cafe. We were served by two waitresses, for some reason. One was very pleasant, but the other one was not. I think that this could be a cafe that warrants a trip across town if the prices were more reasonable and the wait staff a bit more consistently pleasant and attentive.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	I love this shop! There's not much else I can say... I just love it!! It is exciting and fun to shop there - I always find something new to try. It's beautiful!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	I had a pasta dish in the caffe bar for lunch when I met an old friend with whom I used to work in San Francisco before she moved back to Edinburgh. Valvona & Crolla was someplace I had on my Edinburgh food list to try not only for its caffe bar, and wonderous selection of deli meats, cheeses, and wines but because it was mentioned in one of Andrew McCall Smith's Isabel Dahousie novels. The fact that it was 2 blocks from the B&B I was staying in was also a factor.\n\nGood meal, good company, and I'll have to return one day to pick up some picnic supplies.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Once upon a time this flag ship store had unrivalled customer service and great customer service. The deli remains very wonderful with an amazing selection at dizzying prices but yesterday I wanted to show my husband the vin cafe situated at the back of the deli. A waiter said we could sit anywhere. It was not busy with only four other tables taken. Four waiting staff. After a few mins a waitress gave us the menus and five mins later came back to take our order for two cappuccinos , no breakfast. It was not busy. Other tables had ordered breakfast but after ten to fifteen minutes still not sign of the order we made. I turned around as people who came in after us had been served with coffees so I glared at the waitress. She said the coffees was on the way So what for an apology. After five more minutes I turned around again and looked at the barista who had completed our drinks waiting to be given to us. She obviously go the hint and brought the coffees. Small cups inadequate handles for people with rheumatism  you cant get your fingers in the handle. Coffee was weak and very cool. I asked for a glass of water and extra sugar as none are found on the table and she forgot the sugar so once again I had to find a way to get it myself. Just don't buy anything big here as it is a real ripoff. I did not tip. I even sent the official website my feedback. They got back in touch and gave me £30 compensation and an apology from the MD. So I am changing my star from one star to four as they admitted there had been a problem.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Oh Valvona & Crolla, how my heart is torn in twain over you. If I could eat from here every day, I would. But then I would be living in a cardboard box on the street outside, a very well-fed but poor person.\n\nValvona & Crolla has been established as a genuine Italian deli (meaning, run by an Italian family, with real Italian products) since the 1920s in Edinburgh. They are like the Godfather, but with less horse heads (oh, is that contentious given the current food situation? Hmm.)\n\nFor that reason, their food is at once exquisite and expensive. We went here on a Sunday afternoon to buy ingredients for a simple Sunday supper. Gluten-free pasta, pasta sauce, and some vegetables. That's it. So why, pray tell, did it come to £18? The two types of vegetables we got cost more than the wine we bought later. I kid you not. £6 for a pot of maybe 5 slices of chargrilled aubergine, and £6 for a wee pot of sundried tomato. More fool me for not checking the price before we paid, so it is my own fault, but wow that was a big sting.\n\nOther products may be cheaper, but it seems their grilled vegetables come at a high price. But if you are looking to spend an extra few pennies you can get olive oil that tastes like it's been squeezed straight from the hills of Sicilly; balsamic vinegar that is the only dressing needed to some rocket salad. They also have baked breads, croissants and the like. Equally pricey (around £1.50 for a croissant) but a nice treat.\n\nI previusly came here for breakfast, and I remember two breakfasts and two coffees and OJs costing £20 to sit in. Ouch.\n\nMaybe not the best place to shop daily, but if you're looking for quality, taste-of-true-Italy ingredients for some home cooking, then Valvona & Crolla can't be beat.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	What a great find. It's a traditional Italian deli in front and a restaurant in back. On our second visit in two days, today we shared the eggplant Parmesan and bruschetta. Both were soooo good. My wife said it was best meal of our four week trip so far. Prices are fair. Yesterday we shared the cheese plate and loved it because our favorite (and expensive) cheese was included as one of three. Definitely consider this one if near The Playhouse.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Mortadella, arancini, pecorino ... boy, this shop is amazing. Don't go when you're feeling skint, though - its pretty expensive! Fabulous, and worth the money, but I have come out a bit shell shocked after everything got added up at the till...\nThere's every type of pasta, meat, cheese or Italian liqueur you could ask for, and some nice pre-made quiches and sandwiches too. And if you're peckish there's always a range of olive oils out for tasting, with little bits of bread to dip. That's where you'll find me, oil dribbling down my chin...
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	V&C is a lovely italian, family run, delicatessen. The branch at Leith walk has a large selection of food and drink, as well as a bright, comfortable coffee shop. I believe that they also serve food in the evening. Freshly made bread and sandwiches can be taken away, and there is a counter with a selection of meat, olives, cheese and baked goods. The other outlet at Multrees walk also has a smaller shop and a coffee shop with an outdoor seating area for the summer months.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	I have only been here about 2 times in a year and a half, but it's not hard to tell that Valvona and Crolla have something special and different than other stores don't have. \n\nThumbs up for providing good produce that is nearly impossible to find elsewhere in Edinburgh. There is a range of different wines in the back, and more meats/cheeses type thing in the front. Not to mention, baskets full of delicious pastries and breads. So, I obviously had to get an Almond Croissant. \n\n...It was delicious. \n\nIf I lived closer, I know I would have a peek in more often, but it's great to go into, especially if you love cooking and italian food. You might find that special ingredient you're looking for! \n\nI know that there is an upstairs caffe as well, but so far I haven't managed to eat there. Next time!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Wonderful shop with a fantastic selection of food and wine. Great for Italian Christmas hampers. The one in Leith has a really good cafe.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Extensive. That's the word I would use here.\n\nExpensive would be another one...\n\nThe shop reaches all the way down and around the corner. The walls are laden, fit to burst with all manner of things from cheese to cakes to whisky to chocolates. There's sausages hanging from the ceiling and a wonderful selection of those fancy Italian cakey things!\n\nI came in here recently, needing decorative edible flowers (aw yeah, dinner parties in my gaff are all about class) and  fully expecting not to find any. Low and behold, there they were, in the exact shade of blue I needed.\n\n5 stars for serendipity!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	I used to come in here when I was but a small slip of a thing (and I'm still vertically challenged to this day), and survey with roving, greedy, wee eyes all the delightful edible Italian delicacies. Valvona & Crolla seemed neverendingly big and full of everything then, and I think to an extent it still feels that way now. My family still come here to buy their pasta and parmesan, and have been doing so for more years than they probably want to be reminded of. To summarise all my nostalgic warbling, this Italian deli is absolutely legendary, and has that comforting, family run atmosphere to it that makes you come back again and again.\n\nThe tall shelves behind the long counter display a vision boggling array of goodies, and give V&C that feel of tradition and a long history of successful business. Choose from every pasta under the sun, amazing bread, cheese galore, coffee, salamis and meats, and of course, a brilliant selection of wine. Friendly Italian banter, plus every Italian culinary product you could wish for, make this deli just awesome.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Located at the 2nd floor of Jenners. This place is massive! There are lots of different wines and spirits, chocolates, health food, organic food, spices and herbs, and lots, lots more! You can find some of Nando's sauces there, too. There is a coffee shop facing Princes Street and the Restaurant (well, serving breakfast at the time we were there) on the other end. There were also lots of food from different countries available. We tasted the fruitcake and it was splendid. Good shopping for christmas prezzies. It's on the pricey side but the quality is superb. One thing though, there was no one really available to ask about some stuff. Had to ask help from the lady behind the coffee counter who went searching for the one in charge. After which, she did help us with our questions. I'll come back.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	If you like eating Italian then this is the place for you. More so if you like browsing Italian, then get right down here. What a range of food and wine. If you cant find what you are looking for here then forget it. Apart from Rome airport, I have not been able to find my favourite desert wine anywhere but here. they were selling imported Polish vodka before all the local polish shops opened. bread with rosemary and sun dried tomatoes topped with an excellent olive oil and accompanied by antipasta and cheese from the deli counter. Just one of the treats I look forward to after a visit to this institution.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	It's so nice to walk through their amazing shop on the way to the cafe as it gets you really excited about good food in general. \n\nWent there on a recommendation of a friend and it did not disappoint. Delicious wine too... and courgette flowers in a starter is cool :)\n\nLoved the olive oil and balsamic so you should def get bread if you're eating there- it doesn't come automatically, but is delicious
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	I am originally from Edinburgh and when I visit Scotland it's almost essential that I visit Valvona and Crolla. It's a tradition. This place has been around longer than I, and I have a great respect for Italian produce because if the upmarket V&C.\nThe selection of olive oils, the selection of coffee, the selection of red wine, the selection of quality pastas, the fresh counter with the most mouth-watering anti-pasti's, cheeses, fine Italian hams.I could and do spend a small fortune when visiting, but one thing I'm always sure of is quality and pure delight!\nDo visit if you're in town, it's a true gem and a magnificient piece of culture within Edinburgh.\nThey also do wonderful hampers - great Christmas gifts and you can order online!!!....
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Amazing customer service! My wife and I are big fans of Alexander McCall Smith's 44 Scotland Street series of comic novels in which V&C is featured as part of the setting in Edinburgh. The characters pop in to Valvona & Crolla for their sun-dried tomatoes, olive oils, wines and other delicacies. Angus' dog Cyril once surreptitiously ate a small salami that was knocked of a shelf. Having never been to Scotland, I didn't know if V&C was a creation of the author's imagination or a real shop. I Googled and discovered that it is indeed, real. Next, I found a perfect gift for my wife, a Valvona and Crolla shopping bag. After setting up an online account, I began to input my PayPal and shipping info, only to discover that there is no provision for shipping outside the UK. Alastair and the Despatch Team to the rescue! He answered my questions, got me a shipping quote, and gave instructions on filling out the forms. My order is now on the way to Texas via Royal Mail. Hooray and it occurs to me that Mr McCall Smith is also a fan of this fine establishment, since he features it in the novels. Thanks again and Happy Christmas!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	I went here with a couple of Italians (they're like accessories, you should always bring them to a deli), and had an absolutely amazing time. The cafe, all the way in the back of the deli serves delicious sweets and cafe. No, not coffee, vero cafe, espresso, cappuccino and all the way they should be.\n\nThe deli-meats were delicious. I miss my mortadela something awful when I'm not in Italy (unfortunately that's most of the year) so coming here and seeing this beautiful meat displayed, well, I simply couldn't resist.\nI batted my eyes at the meat-counter man a couple of times and hey presto, mortadela slices to taste for me and my friends. (Italians, I love them).\n\nThis is the type of deli that I've come to know and love back in the Northern part of Italy. I've missed it, as we don't really have that many of them in the Netherlands, but finding one here was like finding the One Ring. (Only, maybe a little less .. orcy).\n\nI highly recommend you go here, I also highly recommend you leave your credit card at home. Otherwise your rent-money may just end up as mortadele-meat.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	One of the must visit places of the city. It's about a 20min walk from mid-point of Princes Street. An old favourite, it's popular with tourists and locals alike. Not the cheapest of places but you are paying for quality and authentic Italian products.\n\n\n Full of atmosphere with a great selection of foodstuff and a delicounter with amazing selection of cheeses, not just Italian, but from all over Scotland. It's like an aladdin's cave for foodies/gourmets!\n\n\n There's a cafe which isnt massive so expect to queue when it get's busy. Of course it does fantastic coffee and cake!\n\n\n If you are a first time visitor to Edinburgh I recommend you make this one of your stop offs.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Valvona and Crolla is definitely all about the space - or lack thereof. As you walk through the door, you gasp with surprise as you take in the shelves stuffed up to the ceiling, and everything else that is suspended from the sky. Deli counters about, and after winding your way around the counters, looking at frou frou oil, frou frou jam, frou frou chutney, frou frou... you get the picture, you find yourself in a lighter, brighter space, ready for eating. It's perfect, you have been lured into the lair of the coffee woman. \n\nIt's not cheap, but it's delicious, we shared an antipasti dish complete with char grilled vegetables, mozzarella and olives, fat and juicy. We drank from Italian soda cans. We ate some lovely orange semolina cake. We paid the high prices, and didn't regret it. So it's not an every day kinda place, and the setting in the cafe is spartan, we did still have a lovely time there, so I'm perfectly happy to recommend it.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	This is a definitve Edinburgh experience, and if your a foodie, absolute heaven. Old fashioned, expensive, passionate. I love it, it's pointless writing a long review- just go, but go early, the closer it gets to Christmas, the busier it gets.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Had a lovely lunch today at Elm Row.  Really impressed with the aftercare. \n\nHad two waiters who had style and grace. They both had well groomed breads.  I was hungry after my mains and had a roast potatoes side at the end of the meals! Completely back to front! They didn't skip a beat. They were delicious as was the polenta, rocket and pine nuts mains I had before. The sauce on my dish was gorgeous. Can't place it, love the mystery. It didn't matter as I nearly wanted to lick the plate!  My friend had a aubergine dish. She loved hers. \n\nThankyou. Happy New Year!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	The service here is always impeccable, meaning I was happy to wait 10 mins for a table, as they worked through their busy lunch rush.\n \nOn this occasion I went for their special 'Taliere di Formaggi' with a glass of the recommended white. After getting over the initial shock that this wasn't tagliatelle but a cheese board (I misread the menu, in what can only be described as an extreme, post-yoga, hunger frenzy!!), I tucked in and it was delicious! So good in fact that I was prompted to buy some cheese from their deli counter on the way out.\n \nOnce again visiting here was a resounding success, I would definitely rate it with 5 stars!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	The best deli in Edinburgh! I live around the corner and only allow myself in once a month or I'd be fat and poor. It's got a real family feel.\n\nThe cheese counter is mouth-watering. The staff are very knowledgeable and will help you choose the right thing. Also it's a great opportunity to sample lots of different kinds of cheese.\n\nI've also ordered hampers from there for Christmas. They are always really well presented.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	This deli is really a very special place in the hearts of many in Edinburgh. Going since around 1934 , it is a little island of Italy in the capital.\n\n\n It has an outstanding range of all kinds of italian produce, olive oils, vinegars, wines , pastas , chocolates at the rear. A section with delicious italian bread and bakery including italian doughnuts and fabulous meringues. Also a section for fresh fruit and veg including some otherwise hard to find items. At the front of the shop a very extensive deli counter with all kinds of cheeses and salamis. Also a range of ready prepared sauces and things like mini quiches to take away. Very delicious. !\nIn season a christmas shop at the back with is a good place for foodie presents, including cookery books, some written by one of the owners.\nAlso a cafe/resaurant at the back. Not the cheapest place but with great quality and attention to detail. I have always enjoyed what I have eaten there.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	I was very disappointed by my visit to Valvona & Crolla after what I had heard and read about the place. Being Italian I was looking forward to it so the opportunity arose when I visited the Edinburgh festival. I have to admit that it is very difficult to find a proper Italian deli in the UK. I am used to buy my wines and a few more products online but no more than that so this time I made sure I had plenty of space in the car, I was hoping to come back with plenty of Italian food and wine, the one I drink and eat when visiting my family, and set off to my Italian discovery shopping experience. All my hopes disappeared when I entered the Valvona & Crolla shop, when I started reading the label and found that the product on sale were all average Italian supermarkets products with a very dear price, and not the one I would buy. The Valvona & Crolla branded products were made by big Italian companies and the only few good wines they had, but nothing more than the ones available from supermarkets, had an excessive high price. As this was not enough, we decided to stay for a coffee, it was 4pm and when reading the menu we found the affogato and ordered it. Again, another big disappointment.. The affogato we received and we paid £3.95 was not more than a ball of vanilla lost in a poor espresso I left the place empty handed and promised myself I would never be back, at least to buy Italian food and wine or for an affogato, and will keep ordering my wine online. I have recently come across a website called Italyabroad.com, specialised in Italian food and wine made by small producers and so far I haven't been disappointed yet, they offer fantastic Italian wines and food made by small and real producers at a good price.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	A truly astonishing range of groceries, cheese and wine. At rather astonishing prices. The quality is great just about across the board here and for my money it's the cheese and wine that are the stars of the show  an incredible selection of both with great Italian favourites. But the prices really pack a punch. I'm all for supporting local specialist shops, so this place gets my special foodie treat money when I can afford it. The vegetables are wonderful too  flown direct from Italy (first class I think looking at the prices) but are just out of my league; but the bread is strangely disappointing. The cafe is a great visitor spot  I always come with my Mum when she visits  but the prices reflect those in the rest of the shop so be warned!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Valvona & Crolla is the French cartoon of a deli come to life. You enter and immediately feel as though you are on a film set- there's no way all that beautiful food can be real, can it? Yes it can! Let's get this bit right out of the way first, before you fall in love: it will cost you dearly. This place is not for the budget conscious. It is, however, for the gourmet chef, the afficonados, and the people who choose one day to splurge. The cheese counter alone is legendary- and contains my favourite chevre of all time. It sets me back 4 quid for about 80g- so its unfortunate that it is so so so good as I rarely have that kind of money to spend. The alcohol selection ranks among the best in Edinburgh, easily, the bottles displayed like a parfumerie, and the olive oil and balsmatic vinegar (with free bread and tasting bowls to sample!) are mouthwatering. The range of pasta- as you'd expect of an Italian owned shop, go beyond your expectation I mean we've all heard of squid ink noodles but- blue curacao fettucini? Sublime to the point of ridiculousness. The bread is made by flour stone ground in Canada, the produce shipped in from Italy, the wines are from everywhere (but it must be mentioned, the company does import the most Italian wine than any other Edinburgh shop). The service can be a bit slow and I found some shop attendants, alternately, snobbish and more worrying, unknowledgeble about the products they were serving. But if you already have an inkling about these things or are willing to go out on the limb (and with the pocket book), this is the place for you. The one sour note that hit, occured (twice) with the quiche, so I would steer clear of that in the future- and my suggestion to the budget conscious is to purchase obscure items there, a la cheese in particular, then head three minutes away to Tattie Shaw's for the produce (as two garlic bulbs cost me over three pounds at V & C). If money is no object and you're a devout foodie, you've found heaven. Truly.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Fancy a treat? Get yourself in here and indulge! The deli is a true feast for the senses ... then go round the corner for the fresh bakery and the bottle shop, then up some steps for the kitchenware shop and the cafe. My Grandma shopped here in the 1930s and always sang its praises - and I can see why!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Arrived tired and harassed, pregnant and with a toddler and buggy in tow so did not appreciate the several steps up to the cafe, especially with a young male bystander doing nothing and waitresses in abundance staying well out of customer reach.\n\n\n Waited with starving toddler in a very cramped queue in the half empty restaurant while a waitress looking and acting like a young Anne Widdecombe took well over 5 minutes to seat the group of 3 in front of me at one of the 11 empty and unreserved tables. Toddler, understandably couldn't fathom the delay and kept trying to drag me into the restaurant. Eventually, i was commanded to leave my buggy at the back, and marched to a table. I asked for the loos to wash our hands. Said waitress directed me and small toddler down (and back up) 20 steps. Some 10 minutes later we returned only to wait overly-long for the menu. It arrived without a childrens version, which i had to enquire about for them to bring it. I then asked for bread to keep toddler quiet which took ages to come. Meanwhile a very helpful, pleasant and smiley young blonde waitress appeared and brought us a plastic cup and extra napkins which i had asked for.\n\n\n I ordered, distractedly, an oily mushroom pasta which i think was about 10.00 and worth about a fifth of that. Kids options were limited and unexciting so i chose a tomato gnocchi which was in fact surprisingly good and good value at 3.00 for ample portions. Toddlers seat was dangerous - it kept falling off. Did not bother to try to attract attention for the bill, but went up to the register to pay. As we left i noticed a disabled loo and I think babychange(?) at the back of the resturant which we could have been directed to in the first place. This place trades on its name and the look of its shop. Do not go here unless you are both monied and foolish!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	An absolutely outstanding deli, I would go as far to say probably the best I have been to in Edinburgh (and even Glasgow), and I just wish that I lived closer so I could eat from here every day.\n\nEvery meat and cheese variety you can imagine packed into this wee treasure trove of a store. I particularly love the front window which is covered in miniature bottles of alcohol, every single thing you can think of, it's so cute. \n\nYou could spend an hour in here picking and choosing food, but you would maybe have to have a few extra quid in the back pocket to fund your meat and cheese habit!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Walking into Valvona & Crolla is like walking into the Tardis: the store looks tiny from the outside, and I'm sure there are thousands of people who walk past without even noticing the place.\n\n\n Once inside it's you'll be amazed at the quantity and quality of fare on offer. The shelves are packed from floor to (very high) ceiling with delights from all over Italy. Be careful at the deli counter, the very reasonably priced meats are right next to the very expensive fresh pastas.\n\n\n Try to get in early if you're visiting at Festival time or around Christmas as the store becomes almost as packed with customers as it is with goods.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	One of the oldest Italian Delis in Edinburgh, if not the oldest, Valvona and Crolla hides a pleasant surprise if you walk through to the back of the shop. Tucked away at the rear is a surprisingly large bright and modern looking cafe. All light wood and roof windows, it's a very pleasant space that seems popular with locals and savvy visitors; it's a bit off the beaten track tourist wise, but just a few minutes walk down the road from the Omni Centre which is itself just beyond Princes Street down.\n\n\n Had a pleasant enough brunch in the cafei. Lovely croissant, great breads, good bacon butty, and tasty vegetarian breakfast which included grilled polenta, roasted and grilled italian veggies topped off with a fried egg. Mmmmm. Bit more expensive than the usual cafe fare, but a nice treat.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	I love this place!! Everything they sell is absolutely delicious. Lots of specialty food that you cant find anywhere else.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	If the house in Hansel and Gretal really existed and it was made out of Italian meat and cheese rather than sweets and chocolate- Valvona and Crolla would be it. I bet you even the wallpaper in this place tastes good. Valvona and Crolla deserves its reputation as a landmark in Edinburgh with produce this good. The cafe area upstairs is great if you're looking for some crostini or a nice salad but I'd recommend you just spend your money on tasty treats to take home. More than just a deli, this place is really special. Just read 'Dear Olivia' if you're looking to be sucked in even more. I love it here.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	A longstanding Edinburgh tradition, Valvona and Crolla is an awesome delicatessen, with an amazing array of food and drink.\n\n\n From gorgeous cheeses and cold meats to rare Greek brandies that you can't buy anywhere else in Edinburgh, the experience of V&C is one to savour, slowly. And keep your eye on how much you're spending - you get what you pay for, which is reliable quality in every purchase.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	WOW.\n\nNow this is what I call a deli! \n\nThey have so much on offer, I can barely contain myself. All I can say is, cheese of the week, shit hot salami, anchovy paste, homebaked bread, Italian biscuits and chocolate; fine wines and beers from around the world. The shelves in here are tall and packed full of food that's rich, fresh, delicious but also really good for you!\n\nKicks Peckhams in the butt, and I never thought I'd say that. It feels like a betrayal, but it has to be said. Never seen a deli like this. The biggest dill pickles I've ever seen, and the chocolate treats! There are no words. Just go and see for yourself. As good as the food is, it's so healthy you'll probably win back ten years of your lifespan.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	On first glance it looks like a delicatessen. However if you walk all the way through there is a hidden cafe at the back.\n\n\n Went there for brunch and it was lovely. The coffee was delicious and they come in really large cups which is always a winner for me. Food is a bit pricey but was lovely. Service was also really good, they made my own type of continental breakfast for me!
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	I went there for brunch on Sunday and it was really rather good.\n\n\n In fact, I don't think I can really say anything that hasn't already been covered in the other reviews so I won't waffle on!\n\n\n 4 badger stars.
cBHMUESPj4SNs65Xv6xWRA	Foodgasm is all I can say about this deli, which I've discovered is just across the street from where I live!\n\nIn business since 1934, this is by far the most impressive Italian deli I've ever been to! It was quite busy when I ventured in, after having walked past several times over the last few weeks. I have the feeling valvona and crolla has a loyal clientele, which would explain the lack of an interesting exterior; if I stocked half of what they did, I would be advertising in every corner of Edinburgh! \n\nMy friend and I were bamboozled by the amount of cheese, pasta, cold meat, desserts, chocolate, oil, wine, and many other fantastic things. For the free samples of olive oil and parmesan we picked up to taste, we held a moment of silence. I'd rejoiced, bitter-sweetly, about not having a Peckhams nearby to drain my bank account, but I think this place is even worse!
tzHbcCa6wMyNgQD0zqaQJA	I've been a Stage House patient for about 15 years.  Drs. Ravagnani and Manenti make you feel comfortable, are easy to talk to, are sincerely concerned about your needs, and don't try to sell (upsell) you on products. Their staff is courteous and knowledgeable. Stage House Vision is a great asset to the Brecksville community!
tzHbcCa6wMyNgQD0zqaQJA	Very nice people! I come all the way from California  to get the great service they offer. Definitely recommend!
tzHbcCa6wMyNgQD0zqaQJA	Stage house Vision has a very Friendly team that made for a perfect appointment. Dr. Ravagnani was prompt and took his time answering any question I had. I didn't need glasses but they looked to have a nice arrangement in their waiting room. It was about 5 years since my last eye appointment and I was looking for a new eye doctor - I'm glad I chose Stage House Vision!
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	The once or twice I happen to come upon articles from this abortion of useless information and one sided reporting, the more I can't stand it. They're not even transparent about their "agenda reporting" anymore, it's so one sided it's almost an insult. How stupid do they think their readers are....uh...nevermind. By the site of the ads they obviously cater to unemployed teen dropout porn addicts. \n\nEven their "Best of" is a joke! They only include restaurants that pay for advertising in their paper. The more you pay, the more your "The Best", even if your not located in Phoenix. \n\nThis trash isn't worth wiping one's arse with it!
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	My favorite news publication in the Phoenix area. The ads are a bit distracting but, as Kristin pointed out, "no ads, no free."\n\nThey are certainly the edgiest journalists around and target a younger, more liberal audience. The Arizona Republic in all its watered down glory leaves something to be desired, and many of the smaller local papers are filled with conservative fluff, IMHO. \n\nThe New Times takes an active interest in local music and local artists of all kinds and types, and takes aggressive stances on many issues, political and otherwise. It's refreshing to see some cojones in local news reporting from time to time, even if they don't always do it in the most serious fashion.
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	Trashy rag that besmirches heroes: http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/valleyfever/2013/07/brendan_mcdonough_sole_survivo.php\n\nFingers crossed their ad revenue plummets.
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	Dear New Times,\n\nI don't quite understand why the reviewers here are so down on you but can only conjecture how most aren't strip club aficionados, in need of a good car stereo at low, low, prices, and, have little interest in attending concert events featuring eighties bands who've been on 'Behind the Music-where are they now'.\n\nBut that's precisely why I love you. \nWIthout you, how would I have ever known Chesty Morgan was performing a one-night only  gig at Bourbon Street? I've never seen 96FFFF tits prior to or since that day, so kudos for that one. The image of her hot air balloon tits will be forever seared into my temporal lobes, and one that I frequently whip-out, right along with my hoo-dilly when I need to...well, you know. \nA triumphant five stars for that piece of it.\n\nAs for the car stereo places featuring the 'One dollar install', what a load of shit those places are. They may only charge a buck to install it, but you can get the same piece of equipment on Crutchfield Online for half the money, and, get a high school dropout to install it for a couple of blunts. \nSo no stars for those thieving fucks.\n\nAnd your classifieds? I love them. Particularly the variety.\nMen seeking women.\nWomen seeking men.\nBi-men seeking racially bigoted trans-gendered she-male dominatrix.\nWomen seeking goats.\nIs there no end to your ever-growing list of classified captions? \nFive more stars, but mainly for your consideration of the deviant sex aficionado whose only outlet prior to your varietal classifieds was either NAMBLA, or a henhouse.\n\nAnother section of your paper I love is the call girl ads. \nYet five more stars and big fat mega props to your devoting page after page to these industrious eager beavers.\nI can't begin to tell you how consoling it is to know that when it's my turn to host poker night, I can choose from any number of 'college coeds' to make certain my soiree is the hit of the season. Although, I can't give you a bunch of stars on this one.\nNot only did one of my buddies lose a stack that night at poker, he also lost his longtime girlfriend, and, with no medical insurance, his low-rent romance cost him a couple of trips to the clinic. \nYou may want to look into this. \nMaybe put one of your reporters on the case, since it tends to irretrievably fuck-up people's lives when someone shows up to the party with chlamydia.\nMajor party foul.\n\nAnyway, overall, I have to give you high marks. \nBetween Chesty's gigantor titties, 'mostly' disease-free call girls, and, seeing at least two of the original Eagles perform at some Indian Casino way the hell out in BFE, my life has only been greatly enhanced by what most here caption as an 'uninformative rag.'\nI find you anything but.\n\nPS.\nIf you need someone to write a comedy food review column, I think I'm your boy.\n\nIf not, then I suggest having one of your reporters go undercover, hoping they meet up with 'Destiny'. One of your call 'girl' ad customers who conveniently forgot to mention how she was in possession of one very large dick. \nThat was another 'big' party foul.
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	Every time I want to complain about how many dang ads are in this paper I remind myself how much I paid.  Ah yes, free.  No ads, no free.  \n\nThe new times has some awesome front line reporting.  It's pretty sad to me how many issues don't make it on the news, or into our legislature until they have been discussed in the New Times.  Unfortunately, it can never have the full journalistic edge to it because they will occasionally do this wild and wacky stories with so much sarcasm some folks think they are real and get all hurt, while everyone else realizes it's a joke.  I like the idea, but I'd rather if that was done as a smaller story rather than a cover story.  But anyhow....\n\nAwesome classifieds section.  Kinda scary in parts - I mean, you KNOW some of those can't be legal - but there is some good stuff there too.  Pretty darn good music and food reviews generally too.  \n\nPersonal Bonus: At Christmas, their pages are the perfect size for wrapping ornaments.  Score.
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	How I wish our dog Emilie wasn't potty trained. How I wish my bird Lu Lu wasn't eaten alive by a rogue Labrador a few years ago. How I wish I hadn't given up my paper mac-he hobby.\n\nThat way I would put to good use this useless newspaper. \n\nIrresponsible reporting. Pretentious and condescending writing. Horrible graphics and photographs.\n\nNew Times. Get real. It's time to stop playing high school newspaper.
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	The only reason Phoenix New times is still around is because it's free. Their strip club supporters and ads is whats keeping them in business.  No one with any common sense would buy Phx new times paper if it was for sale.\n\n They call anyone who is against illegal immigration. Bigots.  lol \n\n The only good story i read on Phx new times is the story about lifelock.com. How it is a scam and that the owners ID was stolen many times. I guess showing your SSN on national TV is a good way to become a victim of ID theft.\n\nother than that. story after story about how much they hate Sheriff Joe and all anti illegal people.
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	After talking about the New Times in the forums, I thought I should probably bring my opinion here!\n\nI used to read the New Times regularly and really enjoyed their articles. I ate up their stories on Arpaio and other political subjects.\n\nBut then a group I'm part of was the subject of a really deceptive column, and I learned an acquaintance of mine had a feature article written about her in which they completely fabricated some quotes, and then there's the whole 'April Fool's' fiasco with the article on the chef who prepared endangered species...\n\nAnyway, bottom line is that the New Times is here to provide entertainment at their subjects' expense, and very rarely provide news. I still read it sometimes for a laugh or to check out event listings, but that's about it. I'm sure there's stellar information in here every so often, but I'd rather not wade through the bullshit to find it.
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	Look in the dictionary (remember dictionaries? those books full of definitions of words?) under "consolidated" and you'll find New Times. Once upon a time, in the pre-Yelp/pre-Facebook era, New Times really did serve its purpose as a proverbial 'alternative newsweekly.' It was thicker than a phone book (remember phone books? those books...er, never mind). The point being, half of the pages were full-page ads for car stereo installs and a local movie theater chain - so you could help plan for the weekend. All their staff was local, and Phoenix had New Times, New York had Village Voice, LA had LA Weekly, and so on. \n\nOh, how times have changed. New Times circa 2012-2013 really doesn't seem like it's a viable 'alternative newsweekly' anymore. Their editorial bread and butter, as it were, is all Sheriff Joe - and...? Nothing else besides Sheriff Joe? That's really the only local content. I miss "The Bird" column that had more diverse local stories. I miss the pre-foodie 'Cap'n Dave' food sections. And in the Romney 'Women With Binders' era, I really miss their then-controversial coverage of the FLDS compound in Colorado City. It seems like they surrendered it all over to Gannett & AZ Central (the Arizona Republic.) \n\nTime was, locals would look forward to Thursdays to get a New Times. Now, there really isn't that much gotta-read-it urgency anymore. Pick it up on Friday, on a Saturday, or a Sunday, and it's as "meh" as it gets.
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	Not so much a liberal approach to reporting as a brainless attempt to convey "news," New Times has continued to disappoint and frustrate me on a weekly basis. So, why do I subject myself to the pain of this paper? Usually, only two things [garnering it the two stars]: Savage Love and the Night&Day. The former keeps me informed (and sometimes offers new ideas to keep that spark going ;) ) while the latter gives me something to plan on doing over the weekend. Honestly, it was N&D that turned me on to Cazwell. Some times the restaurant and movie reviews aren't painful. Otherwise, there is no worthwhile content in this paper. That, and I feel I've been duped by their fabricated stories a few too many times and you're wasting your time; you're not The Onion and are wasting our time if you think you are.\n\nWhile I consider myself left-of-center, New Times just dives off the deep end without its inflatable floatation devices. I'm not member of Sheriff Joe's fan club, but I don't view him as a serpentine demon. And while I admitted up front that the sex column piques my interest, the avalanche of provocative advertising is too much at times. I don't want to think my sushi has been in contact with a naked person, thank you very much.\n\nWhen we buy a house that has a little more property and I can start my garden, New Times will be part of that process. It will do wonders to keep the weeds at bay.
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	For years I endured the Phoenix New Times. I read it..because it was free (isn't that why anyone picks it up?).  But my story about a brief discussion with an editor says it all. \n\nI wrote to the editor to explain my disappointment with a particular article. I actually said that they were doing themselves a disservice by calling this particular story "real" since it was actually a farce; that's not journalism, its fiction..yet this publication continues to call itself a news source. \n\nAlmost immediately, I received a reply from the editor. When I saw it in my "inbox" I assumed it was a "form" response. You know, "thanks for contacting us, blah blah blah".  Imagine my surprise to see that it was from an editor, personally insulting me and my intelligence! After the initial shock of receiving a poorly written personal attack from an EDITOR, I replied only that he had "eloquently proven my point." to which he responded again with another insult. I decided that I was the bigger person at this point, and stopped communicating. \n\nSince then, I have never picked up a New Times or any of their sister publications. I encourage others to stop justifying the New Times existence by even so much as lining their bird cages with it. What a waste of trees.
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	Not rating new times specifically, but their friday food truck event. Visited here for the tlicious tacos. I would avoid this event on fridays and hike the extra 2 miles to get to the food truck friday event at the phoenix public market. Its a nicer atmosphere and a bigger selection of food trucks to pick from.
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	Crap. Crap. Crap.\n\nYour local "Independent Weekly" owned by a HUGE corporate conglomerate that owns something like 16 other "Independent Weeklies" in other towns.\n\nHorrible layout.  Horrible entertainment writers. Great for puppy training and starting fires.\n\nCrap. Crap. Crap.
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	New Times only focus on local news seems to be on bashing Sheriff Joe Arpaio and watching every move he makes. Also their astronomical pricing on advertising is just ridiculous. Over priced advertising and simple tunnel vision in a media outlet is ridicules to say the least.
vfn-BKoMtOG6bf-QoU5b6Q	From 2007-2010, I was subjected to harassment & abuse from a Christian identified family in Surprise--they targeted me because I'm gay & Jewish. In the Fall of 2008,  New Times writer Niki D'Andrea subjected me to two lurid stories in which I was ridiculed and reported to be bi-polar, which I'm not. D'Andrea also made an issue out of my being Jewish in her stories, which raises many disturbing questions as to her motives.\nD'Andrea told me that she had intentionally misrepresented the truth and that she had written both stories specifically to discredit me and to prevent me from getting assistance.\n\nIn December 2010, the Surprise police stepped in and put a stop to the abuse I was being subjected to. My tormentors cited the New Times stories as one of their justifications for escalating their abuse towards me.\nWhen told of this, both Niki D'Andrea & her editors laughed.\n\nThe New Times is a hate group, plain & simple.
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	Best Framing in Vegas by far with down to earth people that work there. I have had photos printed and framed there and the work is amazing at very fair prices. As a photographer He also does large Prints on many type of paper thats amazing. You should check his Gallery he has there and that will say it all..!!!
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	We are new to Las Vegas and looking for a framer for our fine art and for our clients. Wonderful framing job. They ordered a frame special in brushed silver and assisted as the frame was warped. Great work and communication all the way. Thank you!!!
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	Randall's does excellent work!\n\nI have had prints done, had a broken frame repaired, and done multiple large custom framing projects at Randall's.  Everything has come out awesome.  Friendly and knowledgable staff.\n\nHighly recommended!
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	If you need anything framed this is the place to go. Very friendly service and great work.
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	Beautiful selection of high-quality ORIGINAL artwork in the gallery by local artists. Also, the BEST selection of custom frames in town. Always a pleasure to do business with Randall's!
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	I found this shop on Yelp, and I was in a real pinch trying to get a professional print and frame job done quickly. I was up against what seemed like an unrealistic deadline, but Randall's made it happen for me! They had enough materials on hand to get started right away, and they not only gave me some options, but also had some great suggestions on how to make it really pop. We ultimately decided on a two color double-layer matte, which is something I would have never thought to do, and wow did it work out great. It's all about the details... They really know what they're doing. Very professional. I would highly recommend this shop for any custom framing of any kind. I even spent a few minutes getting the tour of some of their memorabilia on hand that was being mounted. They do it all. Great stuff. Thanks, guys!
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	I cannot say enough about this shop.  We came in with a painting for my son and they were very helpful in selecting a frame and border.  We had some other special requests and they were able to accommodate every one.  The gentlemen who helped us took the time to understand our needs and provided us a great solution.  If you need framing, I would highly recommend this shop.
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	Just by searching on Google and reading Yelp reviews, I found Randall's Art and Framing. We had three maps that needed framing, one was rather large and Randy found the perfect frame to match our doors. \n\nHe picked up and delivered our maps and did the work on time and it looks great! We are very happy with our choice and his price was very competitive.
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	Best store for framing ever! Don't go to chain stores. It was my boyfriends 40th birthday and I needed to get a magazine article framed for him. Typically it takes 2 weeks. Randall got it done in less than 48 hours for me after I begged to have it done in time for his birthday. Amazing service and did an amazing job on the framing! Will be coming here for all future needs
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	We recently had a concert print framed here and we LOVE it! The gentleman that helped us made some great suggestions, and the result is beautiful. I can't wait to return with more prints, posters, and pictures:) We were also quoted two weeks for the project, and we received a call only after one week- nice:)
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	Lets start by saying that I'm a framers wet dream. I walk in and notice the place is in disarray, and a guy behind the counter that never looks up but asked use if we need help. I unrolled the print and he had me lay it down on a work area covered in junk. The space was barely big enough for the art. He wanted to know if I wanted a mat, I said yeah I want to pull some color out it. He says well theres not much color in the print. HMM? It is a 12 color screen print but whatever. I gave him a general idea of what frame type I wanted and he grabs a sample tosses it down and it HITS the print. Luckily no damage, but still. The door opens and the guy runs over so excited to greet the delivery guy and forgets all about us.Then he comes over and  I think he's ready to assist us and he slides my print over so he can fill out a check for the delivery guy. The wife and I are just standing there watching him for 10 minutes  and finally I asked him if he's done helping us or what. He tells me that he has a delivery to take of. I guess his delivery was so much more important than we were so I left. He had not a problem with me leaving and it would have been nice to explain to me that he has a delivery and ill be right with you.If this is the way he runs a business its a surprise its still open. His demeanor was of one that I was bothering him. Thats ok I directly went to another shop and spent $400 on frame job. I Have at least 50 prints that I need framed and he lost every bit of my business.
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	Great job framing a canvas piece that I brought back from Panama. On time and relatively good pricing, I think. Either way I love the piece and the work they did on it.
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	Randall's art and framing has been in the Las Vegas area for over 20 years and has continued to show excellence, quality, and persistence in taking the time to do things right. Whether you're looking for something  elegant to put up on the walls or you need custom picture framing for your already desired piece, Randall's can help.
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	I have been looking for a place that could turn my canvasses into professional art prints and boy, let me tell ya, this is much harder than it sounds.\nWith Google, Yelp, Around Me...you would think it would be simple, right?\nI may have spent a few days researching this; I found less than a handful of places advertising this in any of the above mentioned places, and Randall's is one of two? I found on Yelp. Even he asked me," How'd you hear of us?" \nI called first to get hours and see if they could do what I needed: I wanted to bring in the canvasses, have them professionally photographed, printed actual size ( I have one that is 36x36), then archive them for when I need more prints made.\nI found the place simply enough, on Decatur, and realized I had driven past it before; it's next to a tile store and a 7-11.\nWhen you walk inside, it is an art gallery up front and at the desk, a framing shop. So I guess I can go there when I need frames too!\nTurn around time was about a week ( awesome! ) and the price was very reasonable! I even got bonus items. I am so thrilled to have found Randall's, and will be ordering all my prints through him from now on!
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	Had a piece that needed to be re-glassed. After checking with a chain store and being unsatisfied with their quote I started to look for a local place to do the job. \n\nI found Randall's and after a quick quote over the phone I dropped it off. I picked it to a few days later and it looked great. They even replaced the original shoddy hanger on the back free of charge. \n\nThanks!
9TfpnjAKFtP1u3C3eIFQ5Q	Great old school vegas framers ... Randy and his crew has done many pieces for me over the last 20 yrs.... very experienced and helpful with ideas. I will only go here for my framing needs... very reasonable prices too!!! Thanx Randy!!!!
IVtp8mznb2vRO0OcwBEQMw	Nett und freundlich\nFreundliche Verkäuferinnen sind mir in diesem Geschäft begegnet. Leider sind die meisten Kleider über 1000 EUR, sodass mein Budget leider schnell gesprengt worden wäre. Kleider mit Spitze sind leider grundsätzlich nur weit über 1000 EUR zu haben. So probierte ich dann Kleider an, die nicht ganz meinen Vorstellungen entsprachen.\nIch habe dann auch zwei Kleider in meine engere Auswahl genommen, doch mich für ein anderes aus einem anderen Geschäft entschlossen.\nEin negativer Punkt ist der Vorhang der Umkleidekabinen, dort kann einen die Begleitung in Unterwäsche betrachten, was mir etwas unangenehm war.\nAnsonsten aber eine sehr freundliche Atmosphäre.
IVtp8mznb2vRO0OcwBEQMw	Danke, danke, danke, danke, danke, danke, danke, danke!!!\n\n\n Ich habe hier mein Traumkleid gefunden. Und meine Traumschuhe. Und meine Traum-Beraterin. Frau Pavlovic ist großartig - ich habe mich während der gesamten Vorbereitungszeit so prima von ihr beraten gefühlt, das war klasse!\n\n\n Dafür gibt es gefühlt 10 Sterne :)
IVtp8mznb2vRO0OcwBEQMw	Da ich in 8 Brautläden war, erlaube ich mir an dieser Stelle eine Bewertung.\n\n\n Brautatelier Tara hat am Besten abgeschnitten, auch wenn ich dort leider nicht mein Traumkleid gefunden habe.\n\n\n Aber die Beraterin war sehr zuvorkommend, hat in entscheidenden Augenblicken das Richtige gesagt, hat eine "echte" Beratung gemacht, was Stoffe, Schnitt, Verarbeitung betrifft, war sehr bemüht, und immer sehr freundlich.\n\n\n Auch die Auswahl der Kleider war sehr gut und wurde schon vor meinem Eintreffen gemacht, sodass man direkt mit dem Aussuchen beginnen konnte. Die Umkleiden sind groß und man bekommt ein Getränk angeboten. Auch die Auswahl an Accessoires ist groß.\n\n\n Nur schade, dass ich mein Kleid woanders gefunden hatte, sonst hätte ich in jedem Fall dort gekauft.\n\n\n Absolute Empfehlung, auch bei großen Größen!
SPdAkTJkQ_roC4dF4bvNpw	Fantasievolle Deckel mit witzigem Wechselsystem leider gehobene Preisklasse für diese Art von Taschen, aber dennoch empfehlenswert!
SPdAkTJkQ_roC4dF4bvNpw	Stuttgart, Berlin und Dublin, hier gibt es die Tausche-Taschen, witzige Deckel zum wechseln und praktische Taschen. Nette Beratung und vielfältiges Design, allerdings, da noch keine Massenware, auch nicht gerade billig!
SPdAkTJkQ_roC4dF4bvNpw	Gutes System. Leider war mir der Laden einfach zu voll um mich beraten zu lassen.
SPdAkTJkQ_roC4dF4bvNpw	Tolle Idee, tolle Designs, toller Laden! Ich bin zwar nur als Qype-Agent unterwegs gewesen, aber mich hat der Laden begeistert, obwohl ich eher der Rucksackfan bin. Besonders auffallend war die freundliche und kompetente Bedienung. Vielleicht sollte ich doch mal eine TauschTasche holen.
SPdAkTJkQ_roC4dF4bvNpw	Leute, die ihr Outfit gerne farblich abstimmen, werden von dieser Idee begeistert sein:\nTaschen mit austauschbaren Deckeln. Ob LKW-Plane, Filz oder Satin. In schwarz, rot, grün oder kunterbunt...\nFür jeden ist was dabei!\n\n\n Treue Kunden können mit der Kundenkarte besonders punkten: Für jeden Deckel gibt es ein Märkchen. Beim Kauf von fünf Deckeln, gibts den sechst umsonst! Toll ist, dass man schon zwei Marken beim Kauf der Tasche dazu bekommt. Ich fiebere schon meinem Deckel für umme entgegen. ;-)
SPdAkTJkQ_roC4dF4bvNpw	Aus Berlin kommt das Konzept. Es nennt sich tausche Tasche und bietet ein modulares Taschensystem an. Mit wenigen Handgriffen kann z.B. der Deckel oder mehr ausgetauscht oder angepasst werden. Morgens konservativ und abends hip oder umgekehrt. Inzwischen gibt es 4 Läden, davon 2 in Deutschland. Ausgedacht haben es sich 2 Landschaftsgärtner (Heiko Braun und Antje Wordschke). Es werden 8 Größen, 10 Farben und viele Deckel angeboten. Die Namen der Taschen sind Rabenvater, Fotograf, Ordnungshüter, Schwerstarbeiter, Nachtschwärmer und mehr. Das Material macht einen sehr belastbaren Eindruck und ist aus LKW-Plane. Eine Tasche kostet 49EUR bis 129EUR, Deckel 13EUR bis 22EUR. Beim Kauf einer Tasche gibt es 2 Deckel mit. Der Laden ist funktional, steril eingerichtet. Das Personal hilft gerne und schwätzt nichts auf! \nMeinem Eindruck nach stimmt das Konzept, die Umsetzung der Idee ist perfekt und das Geschäft war gut besucht. Schön dass die Stuttgarter als zweites gleich nach Berlin berücksichtigt wurden. Zur Sparmentalität würde es passen.
25lVJgvthMyvoRz-W6splw	Poor business practice!  I posted a comment on Facebook yesterday about the crappy service I received in Fort Lauderdale at the kiosk in the Galleria Mall, but Ghost Armor continues to remove it when I repost, obviously to cover up any negative practices so the only thing that people see here on their Facebook page is the good stuff.  Too bad that the posting wasn't left for people to understand that the full disclosure isn't being provided, prior to closing the sale, as to how the replacement plan works.  The kids who work at the kiosk in Fort Lauderdale pitch the product, but they DON'T tell you that you have to return the old Ghost Armor film to get the next new one for $5.00.  So, I go to get the new one after the old one had been removed and I'm told that I'm out of luck.  The guy was really rude and blew me off with an attitude.  I contacted the corporate office and was told that I should have read the fine print on the sales receipt (buyer beware, they tell you all the seemingly good stuff, but don't tell you the important stuff).  So they pitch the sale and suck you in and then you're on your own.  Very bad, and it felt like part of the excuse from the Corp office was that the Florida mall kiosks are privately owned, but if I would go home, get online, complete a registration process, then call the corp office back again they would issue a warranty or something, then GO BACK to the mall to the rude punk... yeah right, I don't think so, for a piece of plastic!\n\nI would NEVER return to a Ghost Armor location or purchase this product EVER again.  If the corporate office blames the privately owned franchises and don't hold them to a high standard, then the problem is at the corporate level.\n\nLet's see how long this post is left before they remove it again.  Well it lasted 4 minutes the last time.  Ghost Armor is removing my post as soon as I repost it because they refuse to let anyone say anything negative, instead of resolving the issue, they prefer to hide a single complaint.  Bad business practice again Ghost Armor.  You brag about your product, but don't stand by good policy and allow your franchise operators to tarnish your reputation, which I don't think there is much of a reputation here because if anyone says anything negative you remove it.  Sneaky and disreputable.
25lVJgvthMyvoRz-W6splw	They sold to me their product with tricky information. \nThey told to me that I'll have life warranty but they didn't mentioned that this warranty is only for once device from the receipt,  not for other devices.
25lVJgvthMyvoRz-W6splw	I'm updating my review being the guy from the Ghost Armor stand saw me an hour later and realized his error and replaced my screen cover with a new one for the correct price. Thank you sir!
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	We have prepaid for a kayak rental but twice now when we try to book it, they are closed on the days & times that they list as being open. \n\n Instead of just letting us hold onto the kayak an extra couple days until they are open again they said they would charge us for the extra days, even the day they were supposed to be open but are not. We would not be using them on those days because we are only able to go out to the lake for one day.  They would just sit in our garage until Just Roughin It tells us they are back so that we cold return them. We shouldn't have to pay for their decision not to be open.\n It's not like they would lose money by doing so because no one else could rent them when they are closed anyway.  \nGood business practice ensures more business by word of mouth.\nWe have 75 guests coming to town next month, many of who have asked us for recommendations on what to do outdoors.  Of course we will recommend places and businesses where we have had good experiences.\n\nI cannot comment on their Grand Canyon tours because this review only pertains to their kayak and paddle board rental and their business practice.
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	I booked a paddle-boarding trip at Saguaro Lake with Just Roughin' It.  It was my first time paddle-boarding, and the guide was a great teacher.  I didn't fall in the lake once!  The guide was also very personable and knowledgeable about the area.  I highly recommend the company.  I plan on booking a hiking trip with them to Havasupai Falls as they don't partake in using horses and mules to carry gear.  The havasupai tribe does not enforce animal welfare laws and many of the horses and mules used to carry gear are horribly mistreated: https://havasupaihorses.org.
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	We are just back from a three day back country camping trip in Yosemite with our guides Martin and Ryan.  Our family has not hiked and camped before and we needed a lot of guidance.  The guides were interesting, competent and even made it fun for our two teenage kids.  Not one complaint the entire time!  Our two guides are Yosemite addicts- they have hiked almost every trail in the park and really love Yosemite. Their love for Yosemite was infectious and made for an awesome, interesting and really fun trip.  At the end of the trip, our teens said they would do it again.  Now that's two thumbs up in my book!
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	We had a great trip with Dallan and the team at Just Roughin It. We hiked the Grand Canyon and camped in Cremation Canyon. The team was great in all the advance prep and it was a blast. Dallan was very informative on the history, geology, etc ... and made us a great dinner as the sun dropped in the canyon. Perfect.  Additionally, it was nice having someone else working out all the permits.  I already have my next trip booked.
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	My husband and I have taken two backpacking trips with Just Roughin It- Rim to Rim in the Grand Canyon with Chad and Gregor and one that we just completed in Yosemite- Yosemite Falls to Snow Creek with Ryka. Both were four day, three night camping and hiking trips. \nWe really like this company and they give a discount for repeat customers. It's also nice to travel with guides who are knowledgeable about the area, know the trails and can assist with any issues that arise.\nThe guides were all very friendly and knowledgeable. The company provided almost all of the gear and the food-which is pretty good. The guides showed a lot of concern for the well being of guests including foot care, hydration, and the general fatigue factor. We would definitely travel with them again.
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	I had an absolutely incredible time on the South Kaibab to Bright Angel tour with Just Roughin' It. This was really my first backpacking trip and having a company like Just Rougin' It take care of the entire experience was just a breeze.\n\nTheir entire program, which included being picked up near a hotel near Scottsdale Airport and driven to the canyon was just perfectly done. I can't say enough great things about tour guide Liz Griffiths, if you go on a tour with Just Roughin' It, you should absolutely ask to see if she's available. The group we had was a blast, with a lot of laughs and an incredible experience from start to finish. \n\nThe views in the Grand Canyon are just unbelievable. You will see some views that are almost impossible to believe and you'll have an experience impossible to forget. Highly Recommended!
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	I have done several trips with this company and each time they have overpromised and under-delivered. I would highly recommend checking out another company for your guided trip. I will not be using them again.
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	My husband and I did the Grand Canyon Rim to Rim Packrafting trip in late September.  Our guide, Michael, was AWESOME.  If you're looking for an extreme adventure, this trip is for you.  I would give JRI five stars except for the fact that the trip was pricey and we had a few challenges getting the hiking/backpacking permits, but Debbie at JRI was able to reverse our trip so that we could go on the days we wanted to.
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	We just finished the 4 day South Kaibab/Bright Angel loop at the Grand Canyon. This included side hikes to Ribbon Falls and Plateau Point.  While it was one of the most challenging things my fiance and I have ever done, it was an incredible experience. Our guide Ken was incredible. He was patient, motivating, and extremely knowledgeable about the Canyon. He cooked incredible meals that I did not expect for being below the rim in the Canyon. We hiked 33 Miles over 4 days and for two novice east coast hikers, Ken's ability to motivate us through the aches and pains made this an enjoyable experience and a great achievement in our book. I would definitely recommend Just Roughin It to anyone who has hiking and camping the Canyon on their bucket list but is a bit intimidated to do it all on their own. JRI and Ken tended to everything and made the trip a memory that we will have forever.
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	Never ever ever again will I purchase a guided hike without doing my research. \nDo not use this company! \nI do not know how to delete the one star. \nAfter much thought, I decided not to elaborate on this hike, hence I will not receive a refund.  First may I state I will never return to the Grand Canyon. Such terrible memories. I will express my horror as we ran out of food and water, as our "ONE" water filter broke. day 2, of 4 days. There are  many many other terrible mishaps that took place, but I will only state , "Take my word for it! Use a different company!"
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	My wife booked us a half-day kayaking trip at Canyon Lake for my birthday. Went out this morning, and were met by our guide, John. After a brief lesson, we were paddling across the lake. Neither of us had been in a kayak before, and we had a blast. John was friendly, and fun, and full of information. Thanks, John, for a great morning!\n\nDane and Jenn
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	Amazingly well organized and professional outfit. Have done several guided tours in the past and these guys live up to their reputation and surpassed all expectations. Website is setup with all available tours, info well documented and all questions answered. Booked a 3 day hiking-camping tour at The Grand Canyon with my wife and two young boys. Couldn't have been happier. It was all-out goodness from the very start. Had a dedicated guide who picked us up early, drove us to the canyon, made sure all gear was packed and ready to go, and helped us get to our destination in style. The guide is a walking wealth of information. Made the camp site a pleasurable experience and took us on spectacular hikes to the Colorado River and the ultimate coup de grace on the last day with a trip to Plateau Point at sunset to witness the most majestic of all sites worldwide - what appeared to be a real time live photoshopped canvas of the Grand Canyon before our very eyes. Even my two little ones were stunned. Food was great, service impeccable, all needed gear already provided (how cool is that) priced just right, and goal achieved. If you want to have a good hiking experience with the realistic expectation of what you put in is what you get - then this is the guided tour company for you. Can't go wrong. We are so grateful for the experience my family and I gained and look forward to traveling with these guys again and again. A+++++ and 5+++++ stars. Kudos to these guys. They do it right.  Lastly, extraordinarily grateful for your guide, Adam Harward.  He has the stuff of legends. Smart, wary, walking wealth of information, great with kids, helpful and downright cool. Thankful for his expertise and attention. See you again soon!
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	I booked a hiking trip with Just Roughin' it. Later I called to check about changing the dates, leaving a clear message to CALL ME. They changed the date, canceled the guide to the original date, then called me.\n\nMy trip plans ended up not changing, and I lost the trip because of it.
GoVRPbvG9oLfNZ54v4nYbw	My daughter and I just got back from Havasupai, using JRI Adventure Company. If you plan this trip through this company, please insist that Adam Harward be your guide. Adam has been down that canyon dozens of times and is a backpacking bad ass. He made sure that everyone was well taken care of. His attention to feet care, hydration and nutrition made sure our bodies were able to manage the demanding schedule and experience/enjoy everything. Additionally, Adams knowledge of the secret spots, supai tribe, geology and botany were educational. It seemed that Adam had an interesting story for every area we ventured to. \n\nMy only wish is that we left the trail head early to escape the heat. Other than that one small issue, this company runs a tight ship.\n\nKudos JRI and Adam Harward!!!!!
k-C9Y1Fymhm_6pqlO3A9lQ	I've had the mechanics at Atkins do major and minor work on my 15-year old Cannondale over the past 3 years, as well as 2 kids' bikes. I also bought a Specialized bike here.\n\nDan, the owner, his daughter, and several mechanics/employees have consistently been prompt, professional, friendly and competent in customer service and quality of work. I love to see their dog Honey at the shop - the gentlest and sweetest dog I've ever met.\n\nThe prices have always been reasonable and true to estimate. And I learn something new about bike maintenance or technique every time I visit.\n\nI really like this shop. There's a real peace of mind in seeing a genuine, honest business in a small town, staffed by welcoming and hardworking people doing something they clearly love to do. I feel so confident in the knowledge base, mechanical expertise and professional honesty of the Atkins owner and staff, I would recommend them to anyone.
k-C9Y1Fymhm_6pqlO3A9lQ	I took a glorious swan dive off my bike on a trail in Verona, which resulted in a completely bloody right side of my body, a torn jersey, and some ghost shifting in the middle of the cartridge on my new Trek. Thankfully, I bit it only a few blocks from Atkins'. I came in, and the initial mechanic first asked me if I was okay. She then took a brief look at my bike, and turned it over to Mike. Mike did a thorough job looking over the gears, the spokes, the cartridge, and all other components. Thankfully, he found no damage to the bike from the spill. Furthermore, he gave the bike a minor tuneup on the spot. When I left the shop, it rode better than before! These guys are incredibly professional, value customer service, and see like really decent people. I don't live in the Madison area anymore but if I did, I would definitely bike to Verona to get my tuneups because if these guys.
k-C9Y1Fymhm_6pqlO3A9lQ	A great family owned bike shop. Nice selection of new and used bikes with accessories that are reasonably priced. Owner is knowledgable and tries to meet your budget and needs when looking for a bike.
k-C9Y1Fymhm_6pqlO3A9lQ	For very small fee the mechanic installed my Schwinn replacement pedal crank.  I'm now much more confident riding hard on the trails. Thanks!
k-C9Y1Fymhm_6pqlO3A9lQ	There isnt a better mechanic in the area.  Dan is the man!
k-C9Y1Fymhm_6pqlO3A9lQ	My husband and I recently traded in our bikes for new Specialized bikes at Atkins.  I think that is the only brand they carry for new bikes.  Atkins'  honored the sales price of a local competitor which I appreciated.  We weren't really in the market for new bikes, but it was time to take our used bikes in for a tune up.  They were originally purchased used at Budget but I didn't want to have to haul them back and forth from Fitchburg so I thought I would look for a more local shop.  Besides, I like to support smaller businesses as long as they are worthy of my support.  Doing my research, I was impressed with all the Yelp comments praising Atkins that had been written within the past year.  Atkins' tune up prices are similar to Budget's, but the big plus -  in addition to the Yelp reviews - that put them over the top for me was the fact that the Atkins' tune up included a power wash.  Our trail bikes were plenty dirty and they looked like new afterward.  Dan, the owner, said that he has owned the Verona store for over 30 years and the business is obviously thriving. . It's obvious that he loves his work, customers and biking.  This totally makes sense when you learn that his dad and grandfather ran one of the largest Schwinn stores from the family bike store on Monroe street when he was growing up.   This is just the kind of small family run business that is a true gem.  You know you are in good hands when you see the team's attention to detail when they are working on bikes. Very professional.   Hey, even his daughters get work at the shop and get totally into the gears and know their stuff.  An added bonus is getting to feel the "love" from  the gentle shop mascot, Honey, the dog, while waiting for your bike.  Great store, great people, great service.  Now if only the weather would cooperate so we can get on the trails!
k-C9Y1Fymhm_6pqlO3A9lQ	I am visiting the area from out of town. We come back once a year.  I'm borrowing a friends bike and her back tire disintegrated as I was pumping it up. Thankfully not while I was riding it! I wanted to replace the tire but did not want to spend a lot of money. I called a few shops in the area and Atkins had the best prices on tires. Plus Dan (the owner) is about as sparkly as they get. He radiates joy -- definitely loves his business. The shop has a good vibe.
k-C9Y1Fymhm_6pqlO3A9lQ	No one in the greater Madison area knows bikes like Dan Atkins. In addition to the terrific selection of bikes to meet every family member´s needs from the novice through the expert, Dan provides incomparable service at that reflects a life-long commitment to cyclery.  On top of that, he's just a darn good guy. You can count on Dan Atkins to deliver.
k-C9Y1Fymhm_6pqlO3A9lQ	This is a fantastic bike shop - they are super helpful and very friendly. Both my husband and I purchased road bikes from them. We had been shopping and tried the usual suspects - Machinery Row (not impressed with customer service), Motorless Motion (really nice and friendly people, but just didn't have bikes we liked, and they put me on a bike that literally tripled the budget we came in with), and the Trek store (also pretty nice people, but honestly we just didn't like Trek bikes - I know it's local so that's appealing, but Specialized just feel so much better).\n\nThey ordered a dolce evo for me since they didn't have one in stock, and it arrived very quickly and it is the PERFECT bike for me. My husband got an allaz and he loves it. Our cables stretched out a bit early, and they were wonderful fixing them super quickly when we came in, even though they were pretty busy. I won't be going anywhere else for anything bike related.
k-C9Y1Fymhm_6pqlO3A9lQ	My husband wanted to purchase his first bike and after an okay experience browsing at the Trek Store, we headed here. We were immediately impressed by Vicky's knowledge and willingness to teach us "cycling novices" about specifications, sizing, etc. She eagerly invited my husband to test ride a few bikes.  We went in not thinking we would purchase and walked out with a beautiful Specialized.  She also walked us through removing the wheel and helped us load everything into our car.  I'm excited to start saving up to purchase my own bike from them in the future! \n\nIf you're looking for a quality customer service experience from seasoned cyclists who enjoy sharing their passion, try out this place. You won't be disappointed.
k-C9Y1Fymhm_6pqlO3A9lQ	I have had really good experiences with Atkins Cycle.  From having wheels built to ordering odd items and service these folks are the BEST.  Dan, Glen, Mike and everyone here love and are good at what they do.  On top of all of that, the value they provide is better than I have experienced anywhere.  I love my four bikes and the crew at Atkins helps me keep them ready for riding 12 months out of the year.  I can't thank them enough.
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Decent location in what I would consider the not so fabulous section of Mesa. The lady at the counter was super friendly and I was in and out in no time with my $.69 Gatorade Peace A town, I'm out of here!
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Worst pharmacy ever. I have been here multiple times (I thought maybe they were just having an off day). The people that work in the pharmacy (with the exception of 1 or 2 employees) are rude and unprofessional. One lady always has a toothpick in her mouth, ew. Two different employees, on two different visits, have completely ignored me while I was talking to them. \n\nOn today's visit, I was told the prescription would be ready in 20-30 minutes. I arrived an hour and 10 minutes later and it wasn't ready, no apology they wouldn't even an acknowledgement that they were running behind....nothing. \n\nThe pharmacist, Phil I believe, was nice today and looked into getting me a different brand because the price was so high on what was prescribed by the dr but I had to argue with the other lady forever to get her to take the time to ask the pharmacist. \n\nOn a previous visit, they quoted me 2 hours for a bottle of cough syrup that was already filled (so all they had to do was put a sticker on the bottle) and there wasn't a single person waiting in the store for their prescriptions. They guy that night was also extremely rude. \n\nI wish these people would remember that not everyone is coming in for their meds that they take on a daily basis....many people are coming in because they are sick and feel like crap....treat people with some kindness and respect!!!!
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	This is not a place to go for your prescriptions.  I was in line and waiting to get my prescriptions and it was a long line, mind you.  While in line a woman who could not speak english came up to me had to have her daughter translate her spanish.  She tells me her mom was in front of me but sat down so she was going to stand in front of me.  She was nowhere in sight while I was in line.  I explained I had been STANDING in line for 15 minutes and she could go to the end of the line like everyone else.  When it was my turn to head to the check out (after about 20-30 minutes of waiting to PICK UP a prescription that was ALREADY READY, the pharmacy tech called this woman in Spanish and said something to her and she went in front of me.  Not only have I been a Walgreens customer for my prescriptions since 1992, I am now taking my business and prescriptions elsewhere.  Terribly long lines and blatant disregard for visibly injured customers on crutches standing in line.  BYE WALGREENS,
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	I'm visiting Mesa from Denver and I'm burning up. Craving cold ice tea I came to Walgreens.  Bought it. And left feeling accomplished
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	I cannot believe that there are so many negative reviews here. It seems ludicrous compared to my experience with the healthcare clinic.\n\nI made an appointment online for 2PM, and the NP saw me on time so I didn't have to wait around forever. I don't think I was there longer than 20 minutes. The NP (his name was Guy!) was quick and attentive. He was very kind and personable, and he got me the right prescription and sent me on my way.\n\nThe pharmacy staff as well as the store staff were also very pleasant. The store was clean and well stocked and I had no issues whatsoever.\n\nOne of the NPs even called me a few days later to make sure everything was good. I've been to Walgreen healthcare centers plenty of times for various reasons and that had never happened before.\n\nThis store was the only one with appointments open, which is why I picked it even though it is on the other side of town from where I work and live. From now on this will be my primary Walgreens healthcare center!
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Totally disagree with the negative reviews of this place. I actually had my prescriptions transferred here because it's close to my work and the pharmacy department has such better customer service than the Walgreens by my house.
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Moved across town and needed refills.  The pharmacist was crabby and also told me I could only transfer 5 prescriptions (I moved from Gilbert to Mesa).  I had only transferred 3 at this point and they wouldn't help me at all.   They said it was a "Walgreen's Policy" which I know is not right.    Now I am having to drive over to Gilbert to obtain my refills.  \n\nDisgusting and disappointing, will definitely go elsewhere.
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Went there today looking for some new Wet n Wild eyeshadow quads which they didn't have in yet.  Thought, hey I wonder if they have any NYX products.  So, I asked the employee who'd been following me and watching me like a hawk since I got into the cosmetics department -middle aged caucasian brunette - and she narrowed her eyes at me and said "no, that's dollar store stuff!" then smirked.  WTF..can the attitude lady.  They sell it at Ulta and Target..although not high-end, it's not dollar store.  Incidentally that was a yes or no question.  What a great way to start my birthday..with an embittered racist minimum wage employee.  Won't be shopping here in the future; though I live nearby.
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	This pharmacy is the absolute worst .. Do yourself a favor and take your prescriptions elsewhere
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Walgreens is Walgreens.  This location is a bit sketchy depending on the time of day you go.   I have had people ask me for money outside and the parking lot is always very busy.  However, the staff is way helpful!  I was looking for travel size contact solution.  They pointed me in the right direction then had someone check on me to make sure that I found what I needed.  Good thing too because I would have left not seeing it.   I even got rung up in the cosmetic isle!
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	The pharmacy here is a joke. .. I have had several occasions of bad service here on top of one very rude pharmacist. ..Go across the street and save yourself the headache!
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Don't go for you medications.. They tell you one time take twice as long as they say and you get to watch all the people that come in after you leave with their prescriptions when they wait also.  Walmart or frys is a much better option.  I've been useing Walgreen's for a long time and have been messing up lately. Very unpleasant experience.  The need to fix whatever they broke in November when problems started
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	This is a pretty standard Walgreens.  They have a pretty decent selection, its a bit bigger than the one by my house.  The guy that checked me out was pretty friendly.
HHJmQuTb6YR3vLY9q4tXQw	Worst costumer service ever, the guy was so interested in his cell phone didn't even bother to help me, walked in he said hello and he was texting or looking at something on his cell phone didn't even care if I was actually interested in anything. It's so sad because I have been going to this shop since they opened but it's my last time going there and I will make sure my friends do the same. What a waste of space
HHJmQuTb6YR3vLY9q4tXQw	Best selection, best prices and friendliest staff. By far my favorite smoke shop to go to. The always have a deal going on and they have the lowest prices on all the latest l, greatest and most high tech stuff. Great selection of glass pieces!
HHJmQuTb6YR3vLY9q4tXQw	By far the best smoke shop I'm Arizona, they have a great location, their shop is always clean and organized, and the customer service is perfect. Whether you see mark or Austin both are willing to help you with anything you need with a smile on their face. And it doesn't matter if you're buying cigarettes or an expensive water pipe you're going to get treated with the same genuine customer service every time and honestly I've never seen that at any other smoke shop in the valley, thanks for being great guys!!!!
HHJmQuTb6YR3vLY9q4tXQw	This is by far my favorite pipe shop. Inexpensive, friendly people. I only come here now. It's easiest to come in the morning or on weekdays though, parking can be hard considering it's right between all the night life.
HHJmQuTb6YR3vLY9q4tXQw	Great plAce for cheap ecig supplies. It is primarily a head shop but it also has a fantastic vaping selection. Not for experienced vaping hobbyists but more for starter kits and supplies and getting into the whole quitting smoking revolution
dRAla9mt2a3-nF1D26VU2A	This is the closest CVS to my house. Granted the store is not the newest and sometimes the clientele leaves a lot to be desired, however the employees here have to deal with a lot and I appreciate what they do. Someone is always trying to steal something but the manager is on it and always catches them. Akia the cashier is super friendly and accommodating. I like to come here she's working. Recommended to anyone in the area.
dRAla9mt2a3-nF1D26VU2A	This CVS location is in a weird spot! It sits next to an Albetsons and a dollar tree. There were so many drunks in the parking lot that I didn't feel very safe shopping here. \n\nWhen we entered the place was bare ! It was hard to find an employee and there wasn't a customer in the store besides us!!\n\nThe shelving was old and dirty and was on a desperate need of dusting. The lights were dim as there were many lights out or broken. \n\nMy purse is a Henri Bendel backpack and the man who was the only one working was trying to get me to check my bag. You can look what's inside mister but there is no way in heck I'm leaving my $300 purse behind your counter, no offense ! So, I went back to the car to avoid checking my purse !!! \nI sat outside in the car for the remainder of the time when my friends purchased the shoelaces they were looking for! I wouldn't come back here as they were rude and I didn't feel safe whatsoever !!!
dRAla9mt2a3-nF1D26VU2A	Was this "real" or a "bad dream"?! ...I'm walking in the store talking on  the phone when I hear: "Sir...Sir". As I'm looking around to see what's going on, I see this "senior" cashier approaching me at break neck speed from behind the counter (they're were customers in line by the way). I stop and turn around, and this cashier "attempts" to grab a bag out of my hands!!..."Wait what are you doing?!!" "All bags have to be checked behind the counter" (what happened to asking me, instead of grabbing it out of my hands!!??).  I give this woman the package to "hold" for me and proceed to the Pharmacy, where I proceed to get the worst customer service I have ever had in my life!!...After "recovering" from the "shock" of this "horrific" shopping experience, I happen to go to another CVS later in the day and tell them what happened to me at this location. After the uncontollable laughter from the staff had died down, they proceed to inform me that CVS does not have a "policy" of "holding" customer bags, and that this woman was acting completely out of store policy by doing what she did. Shop here at your own risk, or go there for laughs?!!..
dRAla9mt2a3-nF1D26VU2A	Online hours say the pharmacy closes at 9:00pm. I showed up at 8:25pm and it was already closed. All the other CVS pharmacies in Vegas close at 9pm so I'm not sure why this one can't. Or at least update their hours so that they aren't wasting people's time and causing them to not be able to get their medications when they need them. Also it's right across the street from the hospital so I just don't get understand.
-iu4FxdfxN4rU4Fu9BjiFw	I brought a suit in here for alterations. I called ahead of time and the person who picked up the phone was very courteous in explaining everything. When I went into the shop, an employee measured me for the alterations that would be needed because my suit was too loose in certain areas. 5 days later, my suit was ready and looking good! Overall, a very pleasant and easy experience!
-iu4FxdfxN4rU4Fu9BjiFw	I stopped by to drop off a pair of pants to have a new button put on and they did it in five minutes while I waited.  And for no extra charge.  I have used them in the past and was always satisfied.  Highly recommended!
-iu4FxdfxN4rU4Fu9BjiFw	I walked in and asked a question regarding the pricing for a hem and the lady behind the counter asked if I had the dress with me and I told her no, i was just passing by and thought I would stop in and ask. She looked at me and rudely said "I can't tell you anything because you don't have it with you." Then I asked about a time frame and she rudely said again "You don't have the item with you so I can't really help you."
bSm8d6-6uxl7H1HpMOqAdw	Beautiful hats! Excellent service. They make their hats right in the back of the store. So you can see the ladies sewing the hats as your shopping. Very cool vibe.
bSm8d6-6uxl7H1HpMOqAdw	I got Custom made Hat. I usually can't find the hat it's fits my head, so she made new one for me in just one day!\nI love my Hat! Thank you!
bSm8d6-6uxl7H1HpMOqAdw	I am really on the fence about this one.\n\nOn one hand, you can see how skillful the workers are and you can talk with them to make custom stuff.\n\nBut on the other hand. The sellers where limit obnoxious. You could hear them yapping how gorgeous the hats where looking on people.\n\nI understand you need to make a sell but, it was rebutting me.\n\nIf you are willing to pay 70$ for a hat and get complimented like you are trying a wedding dress. That's your place.
gc5oiK75fSUwmKeSYKItHg	Récemment, je suis passée devant la boutique et je me suis bien promis d'y retourner. J'y suis finalement entrée aujourd'hui! À première vue, il s'agit d'une minuscule boutique, très étroite, où tous les produits sont divisés en section (maquillage, produits pour la peau, verres de contact colorés, BB creams, masques, etc.). Bien que la boutique soit relativement petite, on y trouve une belle variété de produits. \n\nJ'ai reçu un accueil vraiment chaleureux. De plus, j'ai été agréablement étonnée que la vendeuse s'exprime dans un français impeccable, chose extrêmement rare dans cette partie de la ville. \n\nEt avec 30$ d'achats, j'ai reçu 4 masques gratuits. \n\nJe connais un peu les cosmétiques coréens grâce à quelques sites/forums que je fréquentais il y a plusieurs années. J'ai donc eu l'occasion de tester quelques échantillons de certaines de ces marques, mais je n'ai jamais su où m'en procurer ici à Montréal. Il s'agit donc d'une belle découverte!
gc5oiK75fSUwmKeSYKItHg	This review is for the downtown (St Catherine) location.\n\nThey've now (summer 2016) expanded into two wings: A Japanese cosmetics side (to the right) and the usual Korean cosmetics a few steps away. Whenever I buy products from here they are always fresh and of a high quality. I strongly recommend the Japanese sunscreens, if you can afford them!
gc5oiK75fSUwmKeSYKItHg	BB cream depot, although, not as extensive as at Viewshop. Sheet masks as well, funky nail lacquers, false eyelashes, some  rather outré, but I suspect this is for the younger clientele. There is a nail salon right next door, and the strong chemical odour emanating from there is enough to make you want to wear a gas mask! I feel for the poor girls in both establishments who have to work and breathe those noxious fumes all day.
gc5oiK75fSUwmKeSYKItHg	Another great Asian beauty supply store they have two spots open one here, and the other in chinatown. They have more size options for the BB cream line and lots of eye lashes to choose from. Staff help is 5 star!
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	I would give them zero stars if that was an option. First, my daughters picture didn't end up in the yearbook for her senior year. I paid for the sitting fee and picked out the senior portrait that we liked the most. NOTHING. Second, when I went back to order these overpriced portraits eight months later, they've been deleted out of the system. I wanted to buy a copy for a keepsake, but they said anybody that graduated in 2016, those pictures will be deleted already. I ordered a photo of one of my students that graduated in 2012 for a grandparent, approximately 8 months ago - no issues. But my daughter that graduated in 2016 has no photos in the system because they've been deleted? Never had this problem when it was still Bernhard & Williams. These are people's memories and to DELETE them with no regard to others??? BS!! No notices or options to purchase prior to deleting. Disappointment is an under statement! Heart broken!
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	This place is ridiculous. I took my step son here to get his senior pictures. They had so many people there that the rooms were completely crowded and there were people standing and sitting on the floor. We were there for about 2 1/2-3 hours. A couple weeks later, we got the proofs in the mail. Most turned out really well. I was excited about that part. Then the real shock hit us when we went online to order pictures. Their prices are astronomical. I couldn't believe it. There is no way I would ever pay such ridiculously high prices just for a couple photos. We will now be doing a separate photo shoot to order pictures from outside of this company. The only good thing that came of this was he now has a decent picture for his yearbook.
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	Our first photo session went well. When we did not hear back about the proofs we called to learn that the computer had crashed and all photos were lost. We were promised a 40% off discount for the new photos taken and in turn ordered a large package of photos. I wonder how many were offered that discount? When we never received a call or pictures or announcements we found out too late that our credit card did not go through on their end? I have gone through three other seniors in the past years and did not have a problem 1? I found out that someone had purchased this business recently. Clark County School District should read Yelp. Parents are not happy. I do not know why they have a telephone because after numerous calls they never answered once and I had to take a trip down there to find out that I was not receiving anything in time to get out in the mail. This is not the correct way to run a business
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	Seriously bad. Poor communication. Overbook like mad. It's as assembly line as you get. Schools must get a kickback to use this place.
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	Total joke, this place was unbelievably slow. We sat in the waiting room for an hour after checking in, and saw multiple walk in's and people just coming in being called immediately. Horrible place, they schedule you without even asking like people don't have schedules, work, vacation, etc.
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	The only reason this place even gets 2 stars is because most of the staff tried to be nice.\n\nWe had a 4 pm appointment, and it is now 5:30pm. I have watched about 8 people come in after us, and leave within 5 min. When I asked why, a woman told me that "we have to out certain people in certain rooms" and that "the rules came down from management". \nWhen I pressed her, she walked out of the waiting area, and another woman came in. In a very rushed voice, she said " your School has multiple backgrounds, and only one room, so it takes longer." And immediately walked back out.\n\nI would have walked out 30 min ago, if there was any other way to get my kid's photo in the yearbook.
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	This is the most unprofessional business PERIOD. That I have ever entered. The staff members do not have any idea how much their own products cost, or how long the wait is in the store for you pictures. By the way if your appointment is at 11 am. Be ready to take your pictures at 1 pm because it takes at least two hours for them to get you into the room to START taking pictures. What's the point of having appointments if I show up at 11 and sit for 2 hours! As I also watch new customers walk in and in ten minutes they enter the photo booth before me! About 5 people entered the photo booth who had walked in an hour and 45 minutes after I arrived before me. This place should not be in business. This is the worst customer service I have ever received especially from Antonio, he had no idea and told me that I had 6 pictures included with my ultimate package. But I harshly realized when I was almost charged 100s of dollars for one copy of my sons photo. He also disrespected me by telling me ," appointment times don't matter man, you see all these people?"\nWorst business ever
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	Absurdly overpriced.   There's absolutely no explanation for the school to choose these clowns other than kickbacks.  Somebody ought to be fired.
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	Really don't understand why they even schedule appointment. My daughter has an appointment for 4:30pm and it's now 5:30pm. If it wasn't for the school's Senior photos, I would have left but I'm still waiting. To add to the frustration, there's an odd smell inside. I hope I never have to come back here again.
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	The entire Prestige Portraits company is the biggest ripoff that ever existed in portrait studios.  And, parents of Clark County School District students are FORCED to use this terrible organization!  Our first encounter with the Las Vegas location was when my child attended a sitting for senior portraits.  Weeks went by and we were never contacted that the pictures were ready.  The Las Vegas location NEVER returned our phone call, so our advice: don't bother calling them.  We got so fed up waiting for them to return our phone call, we just went to their Valley View location and knocked on the door.  At first they weren't going to open the door (they just looked at us through the window and ignored us) but we just kept knocking and they finally opened the door. (BTW, they have terrible office hours which are extremely inconvenient for parents and students.) \n\nWe finally spoke with a manager who informed us that nearly all the portraits taken were lost when the computer became corrupted.  All those students would need to have their senior photos retaken.  However, they didn't call us to tell us this information!  Had we not gone directly to their location, we many never have found out that my student's pictures were one of the many that were lost when their computer crashed!!!  Who does business like this???  \n\nThe problem is, all the students at many of the CCSD high schools are FORCED to use this company because the schools enter into agreements with Prestige!  The school is probably getting some kind of kick back from this portrait studio and the school doesn't care that Prestige provides terrible customer service and they overcharge for their products!!  These CCSD high schools should be more concerned about being associated with such a terrible company!!\n\nWhen we finally were able to order our student's senior portrait online they charge and arm and a leg for their pictures.  Get this:  One (1) 8x10 portrait cost $110.00!!!  This is not right that the CCSD high schools are getting a kick back for choosing Prestige Portraits but the parents have to pay the exorbitant fees to get these pictures of their child!!!  Trust me, it's a racket!!!  The CCSD high school forces students to have their portraits taken by Prestige company if the student wants their picture in the school yearbook.  Then if parents want just one 8x10 of that yearbook picture, they have to pay these unreasonable costs!!!  Families are better off going to JCPenney to get their child's pictures taken.  Trust me, you do NOT want to give Prestige any money!!!  \n\nPart 2 of the story:  When my student's picture (just one 8x10) finally arrived in the mail, the picture was completely bent and destroyed because Prestige didn't package it correctly for shipment!!  Once again, our family paid $110 for ONE picture and the company can't even package it well enough to go through the US Postal service!  Trust me, do NOT use this company!!  They're hacks!!!
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	Getting my senior portraits done at Prestige Portraits was one of the worst customer experiences I've ever had. I decided to take my photos over the summer because it was supposed to be the "better option" but it most certainly wasn't. I already knew what I was getting into because I have a sibling that did them a few years ago. When I went with my brother in 2012 I was impressed with their service. They ran like clockwork and my brother was in and out in 45 minutes. Needless to say, I did not have the same experience. I walk in and I can already tell it's chaotic. There are people everywhere and I could already sense the disorganization. We go to the waiting area and there aren't enough chairs us to sit. My mom sat on the floor so I wouldn't get my clothes dirty. We had asked if they had overbooked for the day but they said no surprisingly. We were waiting to take my creative photo for about thirty minutes then a photo person moves me to take my senior picture first. Then we wait another thirty minutes in that room to be called. I thought the first photographer I had suited my needs. (Which was the only good thing I have to say).\n\n Then we go back to wait for custom pictures. We waited 2 hours before my name was called but they only had one studio ready and it wasn't the one I wanted. So we had to wait once again. I started getting irritated because I noticed they sent people to the second studio who had arrived after me and I did have a scheduled appointment 2 hours ago. My mom goes and asks why we've been waiting so long and finally they called me.\n\nI had only brought two props with me. I brought a stuffed animal to pose with and bubbles. When I originally checked in, one of the workers said we could have a member blow them at me as my photo was being taken. We mention this to the photographer in the studio and she thought that there would be no way this could happen. And said there wasn't anyone that could to blow bubbles. (Despite most of the employees were walking around doing nothing.) The photographer had an attitude made me feel like I was asking for special treatment. I did not think our argument was unjustified. My mom marches out and was easily able to pull an employee from the hallway to do the job. The photos were taken and I had thought the nightmare was finally over. \n\nAfter the proofs were mailed we called the number to select my photos online. First we pick my senior photo. The man on they phone said the photo was unusable because I was facing the wrong direction. I'm not a computer genius but it takes five seconds to mirror image a photo using Photoshop. I then decided not to argue and pick a less attractive picture of me instead. I then pick my custom photo for the yearbook which is more important to me. The photo I wanted I couldn't use because the photographer had taken the photo horizontally and the yearbook only takes vertical images. I look at my proofs and I realized they were ALL HORIZONTAL except one and the photo was ugly. Let me just say the photographer knows what school I'm from and is well aware of the photo criteria of each school, so only giving me one usable yearbook photo is absolutely absurd. My mom and I were irate at this point and the man said there is NO WAY we could do a follow up appointment. We talked to a manager and said they would make a one-time acceptation for the custom photo I wanted. Which is great but since the photo has to be edited the size is going to look different from everyone else's in the yearbook. \n\nSo when I look back at the size difference of my photo in the yearbook I cannot help but reminisce of that horrible day at Prestige Portraits. If you have to take senior photos for school, I beg you to find another photo studio. No one deserves to be treated the way I was treated. I can take a sub-par service but this was way beyond that. I was treated poorly, and it ruined an experience that was supposed to be fun and an exciting upon starting my senior year of high school. I felt miserable walking out of the studio and then was stressed and frustrated when I couldn't even select the photos I wanted. The worst part was when we complained, there wasn't much they did for us and they didn't seem to care. That in itself is a red flag of any bad business.
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	I would like to know how they justify the extremely high cost of these pictures. I refused to purchase a very expensive package. I ordered one single 8x10. One.1. And with a 25% discount it was still $56 total. For 1 single picture. I really wanted my daughter's senior pictures. But not for the prices they are asking. Ridiculous. Really not nice that us parents are forced to buy these way overpriced pictures or just dont. She wanted a very simple session. No outfit changes. No special poses. We wanted just something very basic. I guess I got it with my single $56 picture. It would be nice to have any other choice to order pictures from. These are THE most expensive school pictures ever.
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	This is the worst place ever the  appointment was at 10am arrived at 9:40 did not unlock the door until 10am by that time there was twenty people outside the door waiting once they unlock the door it was just a mad rush to inside lack of organization If This place did not do pictures for schools they would be out of business
_H2WDe7geFWVqUyWxMfQ3w	Ridiculous wait times. The only reason they are in business is because they have the high school senior portrait contract. Please contact your high school principal and tell them to choose another studio that cares more about customer service. This place is a total joke. Terrible wait times. I would skip senior pictures had I known about the wait. 50 people crammed into a waiting room like cattle. Reprehensible service.
vqcZ3XyAJix1xYjG_vXBzg	Most awesome shop I've ever been too! Super friendly honest reliable people and fairly priced premium juice! Can't beat it, I suggest this shop too anyone!
vqcZ3XyAJix1xYjG_vXBzg	This is better then most vape shops that I have gone to before. They are friendly and help me with everything I need. They also have great choices for Premium Juices and HOUSE JUICES!!! Not a lot of places have their own house juices, well at least good ones lol. Try and stop by you won't regret it :)
vqcZ3XyAJix1xYjG_vXBzg	Bad ass Vape shop come here like everyday juice is on par and the best in town for sure
vqcZ3XyAJix1xYjG_vXBzg	Juicy Vapes came to my son's rescue once again! \nMy son and I went in today because he lost his vape we purchased in April.\nMy son wanted a larger vape and the young man who helped us, suggested a black vape that is of better quality but similar to the previous one he had in the way it is set up.\nAgain, we appreciate the employees at Juicy Vapes. This is the only vape business I like in Phoenix; they are trustworthy and friendly.
vqcZ3XyAJix1xYjG_vXBzg	Nice place very informative . Got a ipv8 the other day and love it. The guys here are cool and looks like I will come in and vape when I get the tIme. If they had my brand would always be in. Thanks guys you saved a brotha from having to drive across town . And get a discount without having to sign up for anything .
vqcZ3XyAJix1xYjG_vXBzg	Happy I came in this morning, I was given information felt that they really care to set you up with the right setup. Definitely recommend to everyone.
vqcZ3XyAJix1xYjG_vXBzg	Wow. Just a great place. Very clean and nicely presented. \n\nThe staff is extremely friendly. \n\nWas my first time going into the shop, but not a first time vaper. They did not carry Halo brand juice but they had me try some of the juice they create, it was MUCH better than the Sub-zero Halo made of the menthol. The price was also $3 cheaper. Always a plus.\n\nI would recommend this shop to anyone.
vqcZ3XyAJix1xYjG_vXBzg	This place rocks!! very helpful and lots of flavors to choose from. One of the few places that has Cbd oil that is tasteless and odorless!! Thanks guys you rock!!!
vqcZ3XyAJix1xYjG_vXBzg	Jay was very helpful. I explained I was new to vaping. I ordered one online and I didn't agree with the juice I was using. \nHe allowed to me try the different flavors so I could find one and liked and even told me about the specials they had, I was very impressed from this experience and will be returning for future purchases. Thanks!!
vqcZ3XyAJix1xYjG_vXBzg	Great place very knowledgeable staff Jade and Joe\nKnow they're Vapes and products as well as the am staff, great to find a place where staff really enjoy helping you excel in your needs.\nDefinitely recommend this establishment for all your vape needs.
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	I guess it's an okay place. Out of the many times I've been here, I only get greeted or even helped a handful of times. Countless employees walk by and no one really says anything or even looks at you for that matter. You kind of have to find them if you need help. Aside from that, store is actually pretty clean.
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	I've been going to Home Depot for years and honestly this is the worst Home Depot customer service I've ever seen. I asked the first person for help and he said he will find me someone specialized in what I came in for. Finally 15 min I'm looking for the gentlemen that told me he would find me a specialist and he totally forgot about me. I look for other help and he says same thing. Let me find someone specialized in it. 10 min later he brings someone and they sell me the parts, I get to the job site. All these parts were wrong. Lost that job now because of horrible customer service and hiring people have no clue what they're doing. Lowes you have found yourself a new customer for life.
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	Most of our money for our house renovations goes to this particular Home Depot. Returns are easy with or without receipts. Ro and I love this location. I especially like their text message discounts and coupons. Cheers***
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	So I live in the ghetto and this is the Home Depot I go to even though there is one a tad closer to my house. \n\nThe staff here is always very friendly and very very helpful! On my recent trip Denny in the hardware section was beyond helpful, I wouldnt have been able to complete my project without his help! \n\nThe Hubs and I also purchased carpeting from here for our bedrooms. They look great and were installed quickly!
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	never a good moment at this location. Staff is not as friendly or willing to help as in other Home Depots i've been to. Theres usually never someone available for their department. you always have to hunt them down or have some one hunt them down. When you finally hunt the associate responsible for that particular deparment they have very little knowledge. Last week i went at 8:30 pm to get some wood cut. There was two others waiting in front of me and they were complaining they already had to wait 20 minutes because they could not find someone to make the cuts. long story short i got my turn at 9:00 pm. the guy seemed in a bad mood and kept saying how he was suppose to be off already and shouldnt be making the cuts that it should be another guy. At the end i took the cuts home and had to return them the next day. they were horribly cut and cut wrong. my fault for not checking but i owe it all to the guy(i wish i could remember his name). do yourself a favor and skip this store. i understand sometimes its the closest but make the extra drive if possible. afterall if you are like me, you go to this store for home improvements and it is your house at the end.
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	Kudos to this Home Depot (and maybe others).  The remaining stock of live Christmas trees is free (as is) today.  Nice, HD!!
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	The worst experience I've ever had.  I spent close to 4k on carpet and window treatments and nothing, I mean nothing has gone well at all.  If there was something they could screw up, they have!!! I'l drive 10 miles out of my way to go to another home depot because I am so infuriated over the service I received from this store.  It over a month since I placed my order and I still have to call them to follow up on things.  #1 problem- order carpet for wrong rooms after I spent 4 hours in the store telling them which rooms I need carpet in.  Then I had someone over charge me for carpet I was quoted a completely different price for.  Last but not least,  when I ordered my window treatments I advised them to have the installer pick them up the day he installs them.   I just got a call saying they have my shades there for 4 days, how come I haven't picked them up!!!!! I am so mad, I'm shaking.  All of this has really prevented me from moving in to my town home.  Can't bring furniture in because I have to move it for the carpet installation.  I am LIVID!!!!
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	Not a whole lot to be said for this Home Depot. It's about the only game in the area and they seem to know it. In the trips I've made here, I've only been in and out when I didn't need to interact with the staff -- and, even then, I've been delayed 10+ minutes bc their spray paint cans didn't have the HD UPC stickers, resulting in three employees getting involved. \n\nYou're probably going here but, you know, just have an idea of what you are in for.
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	As a female who doesn't know a lot about different tools and everything it takes to do certain projects, it's a little discouraging asking the experienced professional employees for assistance at Home Depot. It's like they talk to you in legal jargon that you don't understand and tell you to go to certain isles where you can find what you need. They're very informed about the products in their department and usually pretty friendly, but they definitely keep it moving. So, from that point you're on your own to figure it out. Duh That's why there's the DIY channel on TV.
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	came in Sunday to buy a new Christmas tree could not find any help!! asked the door greater if he could direct me to a sales person or help they said service counter .stood there for a least 10 min  finally i started to whistle and yelp for someone to acknowledge  i was there ,, so a girl comes out from behind the curtain at the service counter asked if i had been help i told her no ,and she told me someone other than her was going to acknowledge i exists.tree i wanted was 149.. bucks ,thank goodness i left and went to walmart 89 same tree believe\n it or not better service WOW WALMART BETS HOME DEPOT FOR SERVICE !!!
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	It was rough, real rough. My blood pressure just skyrocketed from purchasing some concrete and rope. Grrr.
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	Closest HD to my home. I have always found the staff very helpful. Even in the tool rental department.   u guys !
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	I'm not sure why this location has such a low review score. I live about halfway between this store and the 44th and Thomas location. I've always had a great experience here. The staff is very helpful and answers all of my questions without being condescending. \n\nTonight I was assisted by Kirk in gardening and he was so passionate and knowledgable that it totally made my night and has inspired me to do more gardening.\n\nAlso, this location is far less crowded than 44th and Thomas!
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	I do not like this home depot.  This is the worst home depot that I have ever been too. I give it 2 stars because it is near our office.
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	I hate it when I call a store and can't get a live person on the line or anyone to pick up the phone once I've been transferred--which was the case with the plumbing department at this location. You suck.
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	No stars!!! I had a service associate provide a case price for t8 bulbs and when I got to the register the management went out of their way to rescind that mark down. Nice unstick position and nice service. Top down leadership in action. No wonder it takes so long to get out of the store...people don't care and management doesn't want to help their customers.
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	this place has the worst customer service ever. the employees there will often try and make you look like a fool also not wanting to help you at all to find what you're looking for and if you purchase something and get the warranty on it if it breaks chances are they will not warranty it out for you. they will tell you that you have to contact manufacturers of the merchandise and send it in. which isn't right at all since you purchase the warranty through  Home Depot and bought the item at Home Depot.
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	I use this location near my shop on occasion because it is in an industrial area and has stock on some stuff that one located in a mostly residential area won't have any in the bin for because it is based on sales.  As with many locations service will be hit or miss.  The day labor crowd seems to be above average in number at this location.
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	Home Depot got everything you need to fix or remodel your house or anything in that matter. The place is huge and can use more employees to assist customers. Waited awhile to get my key copy but nobody came to assist me. But it's alright I was in a hurry.
CpYoXlf-VXw_XAnQ8TvZlw	Yesterday's visit was extremely disappointing. @4848 N. 43 rd. Ave. PHX, AZ 85031. It was bad enough that I didn't feel safe in your parking lot, with the homeless vagrants, panhandlers, "day laborers" and some strange person looking to sell quarts of used motor oil. This entire scene looked like something one might find in some refugee camp, half way around the World. \n\nInside the store was even more disorganized chaos. I intended to purchase three evaporative cooler pads. I found the slot marked 32" x 40" and made my selection, checked out, navigated the pitiful zombies in the parking lot and went home. That's where I discovered the pads were 24" x 40". \n\nToday, I went to ACE Hardware and found the correct sized cooler pads and I didn't have to make a 120 mile round trip. I will remember this the next time I decide where to shop.
Z-CMW6gQNoxn23MrwuaZFw	First of all, let me just say that they made me a pretty good suit. The tailoring was specific to what I picked out, and the fit was very good. My issue with this place is a lack of customer service. Someone has seemed to drop the ball in that department. Many of my requests for information, receipts, etc. have either been delayed or not answered at all. I also had requested that the suit I ordered be done and ready on a specific date, which was promised to me, but when the date came, the suit was not finished. I'm a pretty easy-going person, so I ended up wearing another suit, but it still bothered me that they were so lackadaisical about it. I am also still waiting for my emailed receipt I was promised, which makes me question their business practices. I was ready to send them many of my friends who are also looking for tailored suits, but I simply don't feel good about recommending them.
Z-CMW6gQNoxn23MrwuaZFw	Worst experience ever... you will not be able to get your suit unless you are ready to wait for a year... \n\nOrdered a suit in late October last year, and was told that it would be ready in a month. I specifically asked if it would arrive before mid December, because there is a Christmas party that I would like to have the suit for. And they set the delivery date to be the last week of November, and I was told that it will definitely be there before mid December. What happens? The actual suit did not arrive until the end of December...\n\nEven at that, the measurement still had issues so I sent it back for alteration. The alteration process basically destroyed one of the shoulder pad... so I was told that they will have a new jacket made for me, which would take "about a month". It is now almost July of the following year...and the suit is still no where to be seen...
Z-CMW6gQNoxn23MrwuaZFw	I have been contacted by management in Toronto who has informed me that there has been more of an update and change. As such, I really appreciate the contact and someday look forward to trying their business, as I intend to dip my toe in the water when I visit Toronto and have the convenience to drop by.
Z-CMW6gQNoxn23MrwuaZFw	Had a great experience -- good selection of fabrics, very friendly and helpful staff and the suit fit almost perfectly the first time. There were a couple of alterations to be made and they did it on the spot at the first fitting. Highly recommended.
7emvi57F8xWCDDADWSUKLg	I just purchased a couple of amazing pieces from here and couldn't be happier with my experience.   Natasha was very helpful in selection and providing me with options as I tried to describe what I was looking for and what my style interests where.   I definitely recommend this store to everyone.
7emvi57F8xWCDDADWSUKLg	Amazing service from the owner himself!  Came there to just see what they had and ended up coming out with a beautiful modern set for our home.  Very satisfied and definitely our new go to place for more furnitures for our home.  Love it!
7emvi57F8xWCDDADWSUKLg	We were looking to replace our sectional and came across this store via Yelp. The high reviews brought us in. It's a bit tricky in Charlotte since the style that we look for is mainly modern (we are from Miami, FL) and kind of hard to find. We LOOOVVEEE this store. As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a very nice lady and welcomed us in, no pressure. We fell in love with the pieces and it was totally our style. The absolutely plus during our visit was our encounter with the owner. I mean WOW! What a nice guy who knows his stuff and had such a vibrant energy about him. He was genuinely talking to us with no sales man pressure. We highly recommend that you swing by and visit and replace all of your furniture with what's in stock. We were happy to hear that they are doing well and are looking to expand their showroom. Another cool thing about this place is that they carry local art and pieces throughout the showroom (consignment style), which is such a nice thing to do! We ended up buying a sectional which was reasonably priced and I can't wait to buy more pieces! Come check it out for sure!
7emvi57F8xWCDDADWSUKLg	Some of the most beautiful furniture at AMAZING low prices!!! Their furniture has sleek and classy lines...my NEW FAVORITE place!!!! !!!!
7emvi57F8xWCDDADWSUKLg	This place is a hidden gem. I work around the corner and would've never guessed there was a furniture store.\n\nThe store decor and furniture is very modern, well-constructed, and surprisingly reasonably priced. It is separated into 1 large space and then a handful of rooms. The manager was very kind and helpful. \n\nI was kind of browsing so I didn't buy anything but I would definitely return.
7emvi57F8xWCDDADWSUKLg	They carry top of the line modern furniture and amazing art at very good prices. They also carry a lot of furniture that is made by local artists.  I bought a sectional that my girlfriend and I absolutely love!  The sectional came with two years warranty which is unheard of in furniture business and they delivered it for free!!! We also bought a coffee table set that was designed and made by one of the local artists they work with. We get lots of compliments on the items we Purchased from Modern Furniture Studio. The owners are local, very friendly, professional and definitely know how to provide top notch customer service. I highly recommend this place!
7emvi57F8xWCDDADWSUKLg	The old hand-me-down sofa just HAD to go.  We wanted a stylish, well-made replacement.  I did some online reviews of furniture stores and Modern Furniture popped up as a possible source of our next couch.  After a quick phone call to the store, we were assured that there were quite a few choices within our price range.  It was a bit of a drive for us (45 minutes), but we were glad we made the trip.  We are now the proud owners of a very stylish aqua sofa (with an awesome area rug to boot).  Check them out... you'll be happy you did.
7emvi57F8xWCDDADWSUKLg	Unique beatiful furniture store  with great customer relations ! Definitely will shop there again !! \nA+++++
e-H6-qd340BwYTnlntYyJg	This place is a rip off. My wife and I have bought multiple items from karma and luck. One of the items purchased was a tigers eye bead bracelet. I have had it for maybe two months if that and it broke sending beads all over my car. I was very careful to make sure I collected every last bead. My wife called and was supposed to get a call back, a week later my wife called again because that call back never happened. Will karma and luck help in any way? Nope, not at all. We were pretty much told too bad its our problem. Beyond that they will lie about anything and everything as they are being beyond pushy trying to sell you whatever they can. They dont even have knowledge of their product, half the time they can't even tell you what stone is what so they just guess. This has been experienced with multiple employees. They are pushy, not knowledgeable of their products, they throw each other under the bus, do not help when there is a problem with their product and everything is over priced. I highly recommend going to Zodiac Xpress. The product is of much higher quality (actually worth the price) and they are very knowledgeable of every aspect of the product they sell.
e-H6-qd340BwYTnlntYyJg	Super friendly lady working here. My boyfriend got us a jade Laughing Buddha and lucky stones. She performed a cleanse on the things we bought. It was a cool experience.
e-H6-qd340BwYTnlntYyJg	A cool store until you walk in and the associates don't leave you alone for one second, talking non-stop and making up dumb things they "know" about symbolism of the items they sell. The associate stalking us only made a fool out of himself.\nI couldn't run out of there fast enough taking my initial interest of buying something with me.
e-H6-qd340BwYTnlntYyJg	I've purchased a few bracelets, a necklace and a pair of earrings out of the Flamingo store, and absolutely loved it! \n\nThe verity is great, the service was awesome and the pieces are absolutely beautiful. \n\nI would totally recommend checking it out, wether you're getting something for yourself or multiple gifts - this store carries the most unique pieces.
e-H6-qd340BwYTnlntYyJg	The employees are way too pushy and insincere. One of the staff members followed my boyfriend and I around the store for literally 30 minutes. She nearly talked my ear off, in attempts to sell me more of their poorly made products. Their bracelets, décor, necklaces, and various other items were clearly not of high quality. Additionally, she had no apparent knowledge of the products. For a company that claims to believe in healing stones, she seemed to reiterate what was clearly written right in front of me. Halfway through her speech, she'd forgot the purpose of the stone. Her tests and displays were mediocre, and were just a lame attempt to gain clientele. I had declined so many of their "offers" on deals and products, but she was so persistent and overly pushy. It was driving me insane. Eventually, I did not even want to purchase the bracelet anymore. Then, as I was about to leave, she approached me with a completely different attitude. Her outward "bubbly and welcoming" appearance vanished, and she was blatantly rude. I bought the cheaply made bracelet, only to return it at the kiosk in Mandalay Bay. Not to mention, the drawstring bracelet was over 30 dollars. To be clear, I'm not a frugal or cheap person, but for what I was given, it was certainly not worth it. It was a thin piece of string with an indecent emblem Om on it. Of course, even at the kiosk, I was met with three more people trying to up-sell me with every ounce of their effort. I eventually got my money back after a ridiculous number of polite (but gradually getting more and more impatient each time) declines from my end.
e-H6-qd340BwYTnlntYyJg	I go to Karma and Luck every time I am in Vegas, and also shop online. I visited the store in Fashion Show Mall and also at Fremont St. this last time I was in town. Rachel in the mall was amazing. The sweetest ever. I told her how I LOVED the store. All the jewelry and items they have are gorgeous. I definitely recommend stopping in. I will most certainly be back next time I'm in Las Vegas.
e-H6-qd340BwYTnlntYyJg	Beautiful jewelry and attentive staff. Very easy to get carried away here. I've visited this location and the one in the Venetian casino. Love the pieces.
e-H6-qd340BwYTnlntYyJg	First, I'm giving a 2 rating only because I like the products I purchased.  However, the name of the store is ... fitting.  I didn't understand before buying but afterward I completely understand.  I purchased Tree of Life earrings that I fell in love with in addition to a couple of bracelets, a necklace, and a couple of keyrings.  I paid over $300.  The earrings were at a "discount" for $79.  When I returned home a good friend of mine fell in love with them so we decided to go online and see if we could get her a pair.  The same earrings on the website are $39.  Back to the name ... KARMA will catch up with them for their deceitful seller practices ... and Luck to anyone walking in the store to buy.  The employees must be on a commission.  So if you're in the store ... use your smartphone to compare prices.  Otherwise they WILL screw you over.\nTrue rating ... 4 for product ... ABSOLUTE ZERO FOR SERVICE.
uokO-QRhipSBipIxWDRlTQ	Love! It is a great mix of core strength work and cardio at platform. The instructors and people are so motivating and supporting. I never stuck to any workout until pure barre!
uokO-QRhipSBipIxWDRlTQ	Since starting Pure Barre last November (2015) I tell people I should have a t-shirt made to wear to class that says "Pure Addiction". I love this workout so much....but it doesn't stop there. The Pure Barre team and PB clients are some of the nicest, warmest people I know. It really is a community and we all enjoy helping each other and pushing each other to go farther than we thought we could with each workout.\n\nI have been a workout person my entire life. I have been a runner, a stepper, a spinner, weight-lifter, mud-runner...the list goes on. Nothing makes me feel more fit, more content, and just plain happy than the PB workout.\n\nPure Barre is for any sex, any size. Everyone is welcome, and I promise you will be supported and encouraged should you care to give PB a shot. They have a great special for new clients that want to come an unlimited amount of times in one month.\n\nMeet me at the barre :)!
uokO-QRhipSBipIxWDRlTQ	Pure Barre LKN is like no other workout! Their tagline goes something like "the fastest, most effective way to change your body" and believe me, it is. I was introduced to Pure Barre way back in July 2014. Before that time, I was good for a workout routine for about 6 months, inevitably got bored, and moved to something else.  I had run the circuit: running, cycling, spinning, triathlon, boot camp, kickboxing, weight training, yoga and Pilates.  While I loved my time with each of those activities, I would find myself hunting for something new.  Enter: Pure Barre!  \n\nI have been going about 5 or 6 times a week for the past two and a half YEARS!  It is such a fantastic workout--and the results! Wow! I have lost 30 pounds, shrunk several inches (4 inches from my waist alone) and gained muscle definition, particularly my arms and legs! I love it when I flex in front of my boys (8&9) and they say "Mom's ripped!" And the community of teachers and clients can't be beat! Everyone was so welcoming--it is a community unlike any gym of which I've ever been a member.  \nIn the last year, I added their newest class, "Platform," one day a week and I love that it gives me a little HIIT cardio! I look forward to my "weekly date" to fly!\n\nIf you're wondering about a workout method that will get you quick results, look no further than Pure Barre LKN.  Give it one month--three to four times a week.  You will be hooked on the method, hooked on the community and hooked on the results!
uokO-QRhipSBipIxWDRlTQ	I joined Pure Barre Lake Norman back in June of 2016 so I am a newbie. i cant believe I didn't try this place sooner. My arms are so much more tone in just the few short months I have been doing this. This is also for me a great stress reliever!\nThe Pure Barre instructors are awesome and so nice. I really love this place and highly recommend everyone to give it a try and you will become addicted!!!
uokO-QRhipSBipIxWDRlTQ	Overjoyed does not come close to describing the feeling you will get from your experience at Pure Barre LKN Birkdale!  There is a great energy that exudes from this place because of all of the amazing women that use it to better themselves and support each other.  My body has completely transformed  I love Pure Barre workouts they are ever changing and so they always challenge you.  Plus...You are not just another body when you are a member at PBLKN you are part of a close knit Family!  Can't give this place enough stars!!!  Try it, you will LOVE IT!
uokO-QRhipSBipIxWDRlTQ	Pure Barre has become my home away from home! I joined a couple years back and loved it ever sense. The teachers are very helpful and friendly and the folks taking class are so nice! I have been able to tone my body and maintain my weight with this workout ever since I started coming! The more you take the harder it gets and they are always changing up the routine so it is never the same! Highly recommend!
uokO-QRhipSBipIxWDRlTQ	Results ... plain and simple. Fun and friendly atmosphere. Great music. Most important ... results!!!
s2S_vzdoFtYfsdsUZXRUbg	This place is very unique and kinda strange in a good way. You know how you see on TV the fertility mask and things like that ? Well they really have them lol. On the other hand the store is very unique and the art is beautiful. While there i bought 4 glass bracelets and 2 glass rings they were cheap. The staff there is very friendly , funny and its kinda like being around family while there. This place reminds you of an African art show,
s2S_vzdoFtYfsdsUZXRUbg	What a wonderful store!  So many great treasures, jewelry and clothes from so many countries in Africa.  The owner is fabulous, too!  So friendly and helpful!
s2S_vzdoFtYfsdsUZXRUbg	Good vibes in the House of Africa, its filled with beautiful tribal masks and crafts directly from the heart of Africa.  It really reminds me of a Kingston Jamaican marketplace  Pap, the owner, is a humble, warm gentleman from Senegal and he imports most of his jewelry and crafts from Dakar.  His niece, Aura (great name!) is another employee that I instantaneously became friends with upon entering.  We conversed about an annual festival in June that celebrates African American Emancipation and black freedom.  Anyways, please stop by this place it is full of love and joy and respect for all.
s2S_vzdoFtYfsdsUZXRUbg	This will be a regular place where I stop in and support in anyway I can. Crystals, incense, artifacts, clothing, and books. \n\nDefinitely a place to visit and support.
s2S_vzdoFtYfsdsUZXRUbg	This place is like an art gallery and clothing store in one.  You walk in and it's like a museum with all the wall hangings they have for sale.  They also have wooden sculptures, carved furniture and all kinds of decorations for your home.  \n\nThen at the back of the store they have the clothes.  Both men's and women's styles both traditional inspired and very modern looking.  They also have lots of unique jewelry and accessories as well.
s2S_vzdoFtYfsdsUZXRUbg	Very warm and personable service. They have a price point for everyone but don't forget your good credit cards, the art and artifacts are not cheap!
s2S_vzdoFtYfsdsUZXRUbg	House Of Africa Is Amazing. Great Place To Just Get Away And Explore The Priceless Culture Of Africa.
s2S_vzdoFtYfsdsUZXRUbg	Thank you for bringing some REAL African culture to the Queen City.  Shame on you Queen City for not knowing about this hidden gem...props to Mama Africa...mother of ALL civilization.  I loved the atmosphere, danced to African drums playing from a radio in the background, chatted with the sister about Juneteenth and burning sage to eliminate negative energy.  My husband loves the chewing sticks, I love my earrings...We will frequent this place as often as possible...
8pYwfZNZc_6W1l_K6c-HfA	Great shop, honest and knowledgeable. I just purchased boots there and Dan came in well below my price point with the right product for me. I highly recommend the custom foot bed with any boot purchase. I just returned from a 3 day ski trip which was pain free!! After 30 years of skiing, my gear is right. Thanks village!!!
8pYwfZNZc_6W1l_K6c-HfA	Boot fitter working this evening was exceptional. Excellent customer service and fitting and a great deal too!
8pYwfZNZc_6W1l_K6c-HfA	Excellent Customer Service!!!\n\nWe were greeted immediately upon entering the store and the great service never ended until we left with our purchase. I noticed this is how they treated everyone here during my visit.\n\nThe staff is not only friendly, they are very knowledgable in regards to the merchandize they carry. Although the selection wasn't as vast as I would of liked it is the holiday season and it appears they have been really busy. They do carry all the major and most popular brands of everything.\n\nWe were shopping for a pair of ski pants for my teenage daughter and with the help from the girl working I am sorry I have forgotten her name but she's the one with long blonde hair after trying on several brands and sizes we found exactly what we came in for. \n\nI found the pricing to be fair not cheap by any means but comparable to the pricing online and since the sizes are very brand specific I think it was the right choice to have her to be able to try on these before purchasing.\n\nI definitely would recommend this place based on our experience.
8pYwfZNZc_6W1l_K6c-HfA	These guys are always top notch helpful and polite.  They know the business and snow sports better than anyone around.  They always deliver goods and services as promised!!
8pYwfZNZc_6W1l_K6c-HfA	This store and its employees are fantastic!  They are laid back and always very helpful!  They are honest about what you need according to your level and don't try to oversell.
8pYwfZNZc_6W1l_K6c-HfA	Excellent customer service and prices comparative to online.  These guys rock!  Buy local!  I have outfitted the family with equipment and apparel the last few years with them and will continue to take my business to The Village.
8pYwfZNZc_6W1l_K6c-HfA	Looking to get into cross country skiing, I stopped in to get some info and maybe purchase. I was braced for a bunch of skiing/snowboarding die bards who didn't have interest in giving me the basic rundown but was incredibly surprised with the ease of my visit. I was completely taken care of and helped every step of the way, the whole process not taking more than 15 minutes. I walked out with the gear I needed at a reasonable price. Thanks to the guys at village ski!
8pYwfZNZc_6W1l_K6c-HfA	In the past I twice bought Obermeyer Winter coats for my son. Two years ago I went looking for a boys coat and then again today. On my last two trips to this store, I found the selection very poor. Today they probably had 30 pairs of ski pants but only about three coats. Overall I've found the sales people to be unfriendly and not very helpful. I can't recall them asking "how may I help you" or a "thanks for stopping in."
t0m7T6w08rz-xMWxEPYx4w	Lenses in an hour? No. Try 17 days.\n\nThey said return in about an hour. Sorry, the lenses didn't come out right and we'll have to send them in. They said should be back in 7-10 days. Ten days later they said:  should be shipping out soon and be here in 3-5 days. 14 days later: try back again in 3-5 days.\n\n Still no glasses.\n\nWill not return to this store.
t0m7T6w08rz-xMWxEPYx4w	The people here at this LensCrafters are so nice and always willing to help you. I come here all of the time for adjustments and they are so attentive to my needs and never make me the customer feel like I am a burden. Instead of getting my sunglasses at Sunglass but I am going to get them from here from now on. Good Job Team at Midway Mall.
t0m7T6w08rz-xMWxEPYx4w	Definition of unprofessional.\n\nThe pair of glasses I have are frameless.  I broke the wire, which normally is a quick fix. The associate helping me pulled the wire off my glasses and then told me she couldn't fix them and told me to leave the store, after throwing part of my glasses in the trash.  When I went back to get the piece they threw out she got very rude with me and told me to leave the store before she called security.\n\nFrom a customer service stand point, worst I've ever seen.  Surprised how they've stayed in business so long.
Ld62zKGvw2j_N7j6gphJqQ	I had a great experience at this store. The gal that helped me was super nice and extremely helpful, but not pushy at all. I was greeted when I came in the store, and told to ask if I had questions, but when she saw I was seriously looking for something specific, she came over and helped. I also got a hand-written thank you note after I made my purchase. I really appreciated the personal touch.
Ld62zKGvw2j_N7j6gphJqQ	I spend an obscene amount of money on luxury items each year and Coach is just one of the stores I frequent but this location was rubbish.  The employees were rude and pushy and tried to upsell me on everything!!  When making my purchase, I was asked about the leather cleaner which I graciously declined and was taunted, "it's only $10, if you are spending xxx on a purse, you can't afford another $10".  I almost walked out.  Had I not already given my card I would have left my purchase and walked out I was so upset.  \n\nNever again.  I will stick to the locations that aren't hard up to sell something so I can be treated decently.
Ld62zKGvw2j_N7j6gphJqQ	Coach stores obviously sell Coach bags, scarves, wallets and other Coach accessories. One of the employees greeted me as I entered but didn't try to help me past that.  I was looking for a specific bag I'd seen on a friend during the week, but didn't find it here. \n\nThis is one of the smallest Coach stores I've been in...not a whole lot here. If you want a Coach bag or other accessory, I'd recommend the Coach Factory store in Anthem, AZ for two reasons: \n\n1. The prices are MUCH more bearable, and\n2. MUCH larger selection!
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Anyone who gives this store and the people in it a bad review, clearly has no clue what they are talking about.  Ive been in the hobby for 15 years.  Poenix for 9 years and now Vegas for 6.  I've built and flown everything from 50cc gasers, electric helis, drones......down to tiny foamies.  Ive been in every kind of hobby store, and many of them, and this store is at the top of the list for parts, prices, ordering, help.......and most of all service.  Everyone in this store is awesome.  I refuse to go to any other store in Vegas.  There isn't anything they dont know or can't figure out.  And if they don't have it, they will order it and you will have it in a couple days.  The bad reviews are clearly from people that are clueless about the hobby and what a hobby store like this is about.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Amazing service. Staff is kind enough to answer all my questions and guide me through new tech and mechanics.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	I checked this place out because Im interested in doing a fpv race drone. First I don't know what to expect and I dont know anything about drone or even flying one. \n\nI met this Sales Rep names Jeremy He is the first and last guy I talked to this place. Being there for only atleast 40 minutes he told me a bunch of stuff about the drones on what to start with as beginner all the stuff I need. He also gave me an option if I want to build one he showed be the built ones also. \n\nMad props to his good customer service specially I have hundreds of questions! \n\nUnlike other hobby place this place will give you all the knowledge you need to learn they just don't sell they take care of you and make sure your moneys worth. \nIn my opinion they are not after the sales they want to direct you to the right path. \n\nDefinitely coming back and purchasing my first drone in this place. \n\nTip : LOOK FOR JEREMY!
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	These guys are the best. Always friendly and courteous and the most knowledgeable quadcopter staff in the area. I would definitely buy from them again
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	They are very friendly and helpful.  My son broke his spinner and they returned it no questions asked.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	I have been there twice. The first time just look around real quick. One of the representatives did come talk to me for a bit. I didn't ask to much about anything just checking the store out. I did ask him about drones he show me some, but I didn't get real detail with him. So the second time I went I had some questions about a flight simulator for planes and drones, because I want to learn how to fly them. It's real flight 7.5. I did see first at another store before for about $15 less no big deal. I told them about my laptop and  if it meets the requirements. They were very helpful. I was talking with young lady that works there she started showing me some beginners drones and kits for them. She was very helpful. I did not purchase anything yet but they did answer my questions. It was a busy day at the store when I was there. Next time I go in I will probably purchase a drone there.\nThank you\nTerry
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Awesome bunch of guys! They have it all, great service and selection! Went in for a drone, the one I got had some bugs going on.  Went back and Brian and his brother took care of it without hesitation!  They even stayed late to get everything programmed for me.  Not to mention answered all 400 questions from my son. Lol I wont go anywhere else! Thanks!
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Visited this store today, really had beyond great service. The two guys that run the place were very helpful and helped me find a FPV Quadcopter that was perfect for what I wanted it to do. They custom build their own budget versions in-house. \n\nAll in all a very cool place with a great atmosphere. Also, it didn't break the bank and their prices were pretty competitive even compared to what you can find online.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Friendly hobbies is by far the best shop I've been to. Very knowledgable and customer service is superb. I refuse to shop anywhere else after finding these guys!
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	You guys rock! I am new to FPV and you have taken time out of your day to help me bind a quad that I didn't even purchase from you. I appreciate your patience and tremendous knowledge of all things RC. Every time I am in your shop I meet other pilots in the RC community who are eager to help. You guys maintain a really cool vibe at your facility and your selection is incredible. Five stars!
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	We just got a drone from the store. We were helped by Ava and Brian The store is a lot of fun, has planes hanging from the ceiling, 3-D printers, and a good drone selection. You should make a point of finding it and visiting!
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Just discovered FH recently while looking at their You Tube video about TX programing for a Blade 350QX.\n\nI wanted to purchase a UMX Pitts and they had the item in stock and also had a 5% off coupon active.\n\nThe on-line ordering was easy and the item arrived in California in about 3 days.\n\nI usually buy from a larger on-line e-tailer buy I think I'll be doing more business with FH as a result of this great experience.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	I had a problem with my drone after I purchased it. There customer service IS amazing. They took care of me, found a solution and made me a life time customer.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Will not return to this place! tried to return a Christmas gift that did not live up to any expectations given buy the salesman, I have had many RC cars to know what to expect. \nWould not accept my return as "that has been used, we can't accept it as a return." Please don't waste your time in this shop as they are not customer friendly and not helpful with making solutions.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Do Not use this place!!!!  Never have them work on your drones, and they will rip you off if they see a chance.  Really upset because I just got into droning, and needed a close shop for help. Unfortunately I ended up finding these guys. long story short I could have bought a new drone and receiver for what they charged me. To make it even worse one of my co-workers went there and they screwed him over to. horrible customer service, I have nothing good to say about this place!!!!!!!!!
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Went to the store today and bought a new quad copter.The guy who helped me out was very helpful.\nWill be back to buy more stuff.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Bryan and his staff are nothing but helpful in all aspects, purchases, tech support, knowledge. My family has been a repeat customer and will always recommend them, for your Hobby needs. Worth the drive. They offer great products and supportive events. We own everything from fidget spinners, which my kids love to Blade products. Always something to find in the store or they will get it for you.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Best shop in town, best service and best pricing around. And if your a regular well there is benifits to that as well. These guys will educate you, get you flying safetly, and make you feel like one of the guys! I love just hanging out playing with all their toys, or flying the simulators. If ya have the munchies well they take care of that too. This place is where it all started for me a year ago and im still in there at least once a week! They are more than happy to try and help you figure your issues out, if the task is out of your skill level then this placxe is great beacause it's a repair shop too and a good one. If they cant figure it out they have the resources to fix darn near anything! Enjoy your trip, get something that flys! Then come fly with the Friendly Hobbies racers!
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	These guys are the best! I was fortunate enough to meet Steve & Bryan at First Friday in the Downtown Arts District. They had a booth nearby the other vendors, but with light up fidget spinners, who wouldn't want to stop by?! \n\nI was very intrigued because they had this big 3D printer at their booth so I was asking a million questions. So these fidget spinners, were made locally in Las Vegas, with their super neat 3D printer. It was really interesting to see all the different designs. \n\nMy daughter, Melody, has been obsessed with these little toys since her friends at school have been showing up with them. I decided to get her one as a little kindergarten graduation gift, since she also earned a very special award at school! These guys had all sorts of colors and shapes, it was so neat to see how 'big' these little things have become! My girl decided on a pink one that lights up. And in no time, she was spinning that like a pro! We had a slight issues at dinner, where she dropped it and the batteries fell out! Me, being the 'can't let my baby down' kinda mom, I decided to fix it in the parking lot with practically no lighting. Long story short, the battery slipped from my hand & down in the middle of the crack between the driver seat and the center console. I was trying my best to retrieve the glowing battery, but was unsuccessful. On the bright side, with the light stuck down there, it's like a mini rave in my car. \n\nWith this moment of panic, I remembered to snag their business card when I bought it, so I sent them an email about the slight mishap. Within minutes, I get a text from Steve saying to come on down and he will fix it before I break my wrist. I thought that was very considerate of him to reach out. Especially how quickly he was there to help! That's what I'm talking about!! \n\nSo I made the trip to that side of town & immediately as we walked in, we were remembered from the night before. I love when people remember you from such quick encounters. Shows true human interaction. \n\nI came in on a Saturday, and it had a nice crowd of customers checking out their next projects. So many friendly workers every where I looked. \n\nThese guys have such a beautiful hobby store. It's very well kept & just everyone had a smiling face and helpful tone of voice. These guys had treated my daughter & I like we were their own family. I was so amazed at the customer service, or I should say hospitality, we received. I'm all for local businesses & I am definitely coming back soon for a Father's Day gift! \n\nThank you Steve & Bryan for going above and beyond for us. My daughter couldn't stop talking about how awesome you guys are! You deserve 5 stars for the hospitality alone. I can't wait to come back!
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	They spam craigslist with pricing that is fairly good and that they are a good stoor.\n\nThat is not the case, they are rude, they don't seem to want you in there unless you are a regular. \n\nThis is a not so "friendly" business but a terrible business.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Don't shop at this place . All they what is your money . I tried asking a couple of question and all they wanted was money to start the car .
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Went in looking for a switch for my radio that I had broken.  They said they had one and it was $14.99. I bought it and when I got home I noticed that it was a used item. It had solder on two of the three poles. \nUpdate:\nAfter more than 6 months I returned to the store. They remembered me and reiterated their offer to make it right, they were engaging and answered my questions.  I will resume doing business with them.\n\nLeon
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Once again Brian at friendly hobbies is saving me..\nLove this place a must stop hobbie shop
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Spoke with Bryan today in-store, great guy to get advice from, thanks Bryan for your time today.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	I visit Vegas once a month and always make it a point to stop by; I bought a drone from them yesterday.  Great product selection, great people, great conversations...what more could you ask for.  I highly recommend.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Brought my boys 11 and 7 to Friendly Hobbies today . After a friend of theirs had recommended it to them. For fidget spinners of course!! The guys were so so patient and kind to my boys. They let them pick out the color they wanted and the color button they wanted. The pretty much let them customize it to their liking. It was a great experience and the pieces were very reasonable. We will be back, and for sure to tell all of our friends. Thanks Friendly Hobbies for making my boys day!
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	I was charged $400+ for a FPV system and install on my DJ Phantom. I was okay with the price..until I got my drone back from them.\n\nThese guys are a joke. Typically, an FPV system is installed by going into the drone and adding some simple wires to the main board for FPV video output and power to the fat shark system. \n\nThese guys - the actual owners of the company (brothers I believe) - were afraid of doing that I suppose. They installed everything on the outside of the drone along with a HUGE bulky battery that wasn't even needed (YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO GET POWER FROM THE MAIN BOARD/BATTERY). \n\nThey even had the audacity to charge me for the external battery and an additional charger needed to charge it every so often.\n\nDo yourself a favor when it comes to your drone repair or needs - RESEARCH the repairs yourself, buy the parts online and do it yourself. OR contact DJI because surprisingly they are helpful (no matter how many times Friendly's tries to tell you they are not).
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Terrible service, way over priced and they always do a terrible job!\n\nLook at the review from Adam A. He said it best "These guys are a joke!"\n\nI had the same experience. check out this E-mail. \n\nBryan, \n\nI'm shocked you think the work you performed was worth $180. (And I purchased my radio/receiver from you.) \n\nI can send you the pictures /video of the before and after wiring you performed. Including me properly plugging, organizing and un-pinching the wires from the receiver boxes. \n\nThere is no excuse for what happened other then you did not at all follow the diagram I sent (clearly as it came with a pic that says "Never do this.") Nor did you take a minute to google the proper plug channels for the receiver this is in regard to you saying "well they are not marked." Or that 'you added the ESC extension', I'm the one who provided that.  \n\nI'm also shocked you stated "I thought it was in series not parallel connection" which one look from any person in our hobby especially some one that solders connections and works at a hobby shop needs to know the difference! That can cause a fire or exposition! \n\nBryan I came to you and had no issue paying $180 for proper installation. In laments terms and I hate to say it but you butchered my car. I had to pull everything apart after getting it back, then return with it laid out correctly for you and even then I have to re solder it at the battery connection because it's still not wrapped right and the heat shrink on all three needs to be properly reapplied. so it was all a complete waste of time and money for me. \n\nI said $60 because that's the shop minimum and you did put bullets on and swap a receiver(Should be about $35.) As well I'm a reasonable guy. But an additional $120 man, after all that is asinine. \n\nNot only that not one person even touched it for a week or contacted me in the beginning after I gave the guy a $20 tip right when I dropped it off. This has been a nightmare experience. \n\nI will say it has taught me a lesson. I will never let any one touch any of my RC's again. \n\nI will learn to solder in one weekend. \n\nLet me know your final decision. I'm a member of several RC/Drone groups that more then concur with me after posting the details with pics/video and invoices. I'm also going to post reviews based on my final experience and would prefer to say and edit showing you made things right. \n\nNote* He offered $60 store credit which is worthless in that store.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Friendly Hobbies is so friendly that they will only fix your RC Car is you bought it from them, bahhhhhhh. Not so friendly if you ask me,
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	By far the best, friendly, educated people. Not only did they greet us with such respect they spent so much time educating us on everything we needed to know. Gosh I can't say enough good things about this place. I would recommend friendly hobbies to everyone. Prices are great too.
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	With over thirty years of flying RC aircraft I believe my opinion carries some strong validity. I fly many styles of aircraft (Heli's, Fixed Wing, Drone) and been inside countless Hobby Shops and I understand what we are all mainly looking for - good prices & availability. The customer service can be marginal IF we leave with a good deal. Great prices are nothing unless inventory is available. When I stepped in to Friendly Hobby I was greeted by two employees and offered something to drink. Impressive. An employee immediately asked if I needed any help finding anything and was always nearby just incase. The shop carries a wonderful supply of just about everything you'd need in addition to many items I only got on the internet.. Again impressive. I met with Steve and Brian and found them to be sincere and honest and willing to demonstrate any product on the spot.. I purchased a DX-9 transmitter and was so excited to hear Brian has the software to transfer my files from my DX-7. OUTSTANDING. With local shops deminishing or focusing mostly on cars or toys I believe this store will be my new "Go-To" place and I will tell all my buddies to visit the shop as well..
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	I don't know why everyone else had a bad experience here but these guys went above and beyond on there customer service and addressed my concerns not pushy at all and was very friendly just like their name states will definitely recommend this business to everyone who is in need of their services...... thanks for the help keep up the awesome work
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	The folks working here are genuinely friendly and helpful. I was looking for something that must be a popular Christmas present that is sold out in a lot of stores. I let my fingers do the walking and they had it in stock and was willing to hold the item for a couple of hours. When I got there, they had a demo setup of what I was purchasing. They let me try it out and gave me several tips on how to make the most out of my purchase. Thanks guys...I'll be back!
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	I just got back into flying RC a few months ago. Friendly Hobby has been very helpful. The answered all my question an walked me through the set ups. I was worried about flying and they met me at the field and helped me with my apprentice. I know have 5 planes. Even if I did not buy from them they have been very helpful. Would recommend them to anyone
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Great selection of Quad Copters and helicopters, but most important, the hard to find parts you can't get at stores like Hobby Town, etc. Very knowledgeable staff and like their sign says, "Friendly". Glad I found them!
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Place is locked when it got the open sign on. And you have to ring the doorbell in order to get in there... No thanks, that's pretty weird. There's no window, just a garage door. An employee is outside smoking while customers are just waiting outside...
Gcv-LPo8EF_9EDBWt_4XmA	Picked up an arrma typhon buggy here and man they really hooked me up with something tough. This buggy is indestructible. The guy took a couple bucks off the lipo i bought and switched my connections over to power pole for me. Really great customer service will be back to get an rc for my girlfriend.
W36mJ8QSukCWWOydEZ5DxQ	Also known as "Greenwin Smoke & Gift," the very friendly staff makes this one of my favorite Canada Post outlets in the area.  Great selection of cigarettes (one of the best in the area) if you're a smoker. Note: The post office tends to be busy on weekdays as it serves the northern half of St. James Town and the large apartment complex (77 Huntley Street) right above the building. Expect long lines, especially during lunch breaks.
W36mJ8QSukCWWOydEZ5DxQ	Very bad! They lost my registered mail in the post office before it was even picked up by Canada Post.
W36mJ8QSukCWWOydEZ5DxQ	They might be really "nice" but they charged $5 to use computer (internet only) for 15 minutes. H-U-U-U-U-U-G-E  rip off.
W36mJ8QSukCWWOydEZ5DxQ	The people that run this place are very nice though sometimes there is a language barrier.  The post office is almost always busy.  There isn't much else in the store worth looking at unless you're a smoker as they seem to have a large selection of cigarettes.  Everything else you might need can be found at the Rexall down the hall and for cheaper.
W36mJ8QSukCWWOydEZ5DxQ	i agree w the review above -  Great service.  As for the rest I haven't found it busy.  Whenever I have gone (many times) I hardly had to wait more than five minutes.  always ppl there but only a few at a time.
W36mJ8QSukCWWOydEZ5DxQ	I love this place. No one should love a convenient store/postal outlet this much. The staff (older lady) is such a sweet heart. Line ups get long but you see them all hustling. They never keep any customer waiting too long. Despite how busy and chaotic it gets she always great me with a smile and asks where I've been!
s0Mcdhe53H3HBq0s5DXM6w	I don't normally enjoy posting negative reviews on places, but this time, my experience needs to be heard.\n\nI went and purchased a custom sized couch at this store on July 6, 2016.  The sales lady there said it would take 3-5 weeks to complete.  I agreed with that and gave them a $100 deposit.  After 5 weeks, I called them (I did not receive any update calls) and they said it would be another week or so.  A week went by and I heard nothing, so I tried to call them and it kept ringing into their voice mail.  Their voice mail box is always full, so I wasn't able to even leave a message.  I tried contacting them numerous times in August, but fell victim to a voice mail where I was not able to leave a message.  At the end of August, I finally got a hold of someone at the store, and left a message with him since the person I was dealing with was off.  No one bothered to call me back at all!  And the person that answered the phone informed me he couldn't help me.  Talk about poor customer service!  On September 16th, I went into the store myself and demanded I get my deposit back as it had been more than 2 months of waiting for my couch to be made.  I get to their store and the lady says, wait one minute while I call the manager.  I then was told to wait 10 minutes as they had to bring the money over from their other store.  Finally, after waiting 15 minutes, the lady there tells me I have to drive over to their other store (4 blocks away) to pick up my $100 deposit as they had no extra staff there to bring my money over.  What a colossal waste of time dealing with these people.  They have no regards on customer service and don't really care about their customers.  \n\nIf you go to their website, the opening line reads, "If you want quality at a reasonable price and exceptional customer service Living Furniture is the place for you" - this could not be further from the truth.   \n\nNeedless to say, I will never shop at this store again.
s0Mcdhe53H3HBq0s5DXM6w	This was my review posted on Google about a year \n\n\nI had my worst furniture shopping experience at The Living Furniture. From start to finish. Purchased a sofa bed and was promised delivery of 3-4 weeks. Still hasn't shown up on the 5th week. Nobody in the company had any decency to call me about the delay. Finally they had my sofa bed ready for delivery this past Tuesday evening. They stood me up and didn't show up. They had to rearrange the delivery the next day, between 7:30 and 9:30pm. \n On the next day, delivery never showed during the time window. Called them at 9:30ish and they told me they will be there in the next 45 minutes. This is ridiculous! \n And finally, the delivery guys showed up, they scratched my driveway with their truck. Not only were they not apologetic about the damage they made to my driveway, they accused me for "making a big deal" out of it, unbelievable! \n\n And finally, they damaged my door frame when they tried to force the sofa into the room.\n\n Ultimately, anything that can go wrong in buying a piece of furniture had gone wrong in my encounter with The Living Furniture.\n\n Do yourself a favour, stay away from this store
s0Mcdhe53H3HBq0s5DXM6w	They delivered my bedroom set with paint chipped off. When I pointed it out, the delivery men told me to use white nail polish. I've since spoken to the manager and I have yet to be compensated for their mistakes. Awful furniture and even worse service!
s0Mcdhe53H3HBq0s5DXM6w	Scammer alert!!!! They tried to sell me furniture for almost twice the price they were worth. They lied about the source of the furniture and said it was expensive. I went two doors down to price check and they had a much more reasonable price and the correct source. These guys were rude in person, lacking in email correspondence, and seemed entitled.\nWorst.
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	Things went just as described. Me and my family couldn't be happier with our service thank u. Saving 75 dollars a mo also helps!
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	I've had the same experience others have had.  The sales rep lied about install fees, who he worked for (claimed to be a corporate Directtv employee, what package I was going to receive,  promised a discount on my AT&T service which was never delivered, offered to bundle billing for my Internet when it's not possible to do with the provider I had.  This was after trying to sign me up with a different Internet provider that only offered 10mbps when I already had 50 and told him that wasn't enough.  He did not care about what service was right for our family,  only cared about the sale.  \n\nWhen I became aware of all the lies, they promised the moon to make up for it but only delivered on part of the promises and now claim that they never said any such thing.
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	Everything went as described with no problems. \nMatt Sowders in sales was excellent and Ryan from installation did an excellent job.
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	They lie to you! They tell you that you can bundle Direct TV with CenturyLink, get you to sign a 2 year contract. They get the Direct TV hooked up immediately, but nothing from CenturyLink. After getting jerked around for a couple of weeks they finally tell you that CenturyLink is not available in your area! They knew this all along and even try to blame CenturyLInk for not telling you! The owner won't return phone calls and pushes everything off to his uniformed secretary. HORRIBLE! The Direct TV works great, but get it anywhere else. I HATE being lied to!!!
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	This company is one of the worst companies I have ever had to deal with. Beware of them at the Arizona state fair. I have never signed up for cable services or even gotten anything at the convention areas before. I was over my service with Cox at the time so they hit me at the right moment. I don't have a complaint about how the sign up went. All companies all sell you a line of bull but that's how cable works. My issue came when insulation happened. I noticed after the man left that my purse was missing. I called the company and was treated horribly. By Krystal in the office. She made me feel like it was my fault and that I was a lier. I have never stolen anything in my life. And work very hard for my money. One of my cards was used. Interesting only about a mile from their office. Of course with my luck their was damage to the video at the location the card was used at. To this day I still haven't replaced the stuff that was in that purse. And I hope Karma comes back to them for the way they treated me. Cause no one should have to feel like a criminal when they did nothing wrong. I was told I was making false accusations. I was ruining a mans life who has children. Well I have children too. And the first guy I talked to didn't seem very surprised. Even admitted to some of the drivers having pill problems. Just know if you do have any issues. They will pretty much trey you like dirt. I hope no one else has to deal with what I did. I lost a lot.
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	I wish there was a no star!  Beware!  Rep Justin Outlaw came to our house and said we would have fees waived, they are auto dealers with AT&T, all were untrue.  This company is a scam!  I was told nothing would be charged to my card, I was told installs would be free and promised a really nice security system.  Bad customer service and Direct TV was no help.  They charge you for equipment and $99 for a service call unless you sign up for their monthly service plan.  I will never do business with an "authorized Rep" again!
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	Wish I had read the reviews before I did anything!  Our friend Pete (who I already felt was a little sketchy) made me all sorts of promises.  "Did you know that AT&T is going to drop Uverse in the next 3 months - so you'll need to pay higher prices to pick up Directv when you have no service?" I told them I didn't want to fill out any forms as I had to speak with my husband first - "oh no - this is just to hold your deal" - luckily I'm smart enough not to sign anything that would place a charge on my card.  I kept telling them - this wasn't my account it was my husbands and we just wanted information about switching.  So after receiving a confirmation for my new account and installation I call my "sales rep" and leave her a message and to cover my bases I call the 866 number on the bottom of the form that gets me to "First Choice Communications".  I explain I want to cancel my order, the service guy asks me why, blah, blah blah - I am automatically switched over to the high pressure sale guy.  "With us you get direct access to a representative because we have skin in the game, with them you'll get some flunky that probably doesn't even live in this country.... you'll have to wait hours...."  that right there determined he lost the sale.  Don't EVER try to sell your service by bashing someone else. I let him go through his pitch and after I said "I appreciate what you've just told me, but I would still like to cancel" I got an "ok" and he HUNG UP!!!! No thank you, no goodbye.  And you're bashing someone else's customer service???? Very unprofessional.  And BTW - back to Pete - after speaking with AT&T directly.... all lies, just about everything he told me.... glad I did my homework and got out.
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	Signed up for Directv service through these jokers at the Alameda County Fair. They gave us a great deal but the sales guys weren't able to answer simple questions about internet speeds included in their bundle and didn't know what a HOA was. This should have been my first clue that they didn't know what they were doing. \n\nI took the time to look up my HOA rules for dishes, made multiple phone calls and ensured that yes, they could strap the dish to my chimney and the installer would be ok with painting the straps assuming I could provide paint and rollers. I also asked what would be needed to be done to move from my existing service to the new service and got the run around. \n\nThe day of the install rolls around and (pleasant surprise) the installer shows up right on time. I let him in, and hung up on my conference call and then had to wait for him to finish playing with his phone before we could talk about what was going to be done. Once he was done on his phone, we started talking about the install and checked to make sure he understood that he would need to install the dish using straps on the chimney. According to him, he wasn't told anything about needing straps and that no one had strapped a dish in 8+ years despite having gotten confirmation that they could do it the day before and I have multiple neighbors with dishes in my complex. He said he didn't have straps and that someone else would have to come out to install since he didn't have straps and then just left. No goodbye, or call xxx to reschedule and appointment. Nothing.\n\nI called First Choice and asked what the next steps were. They put me on hold, called the installer and said the only way they could do the install was to screw the dish into my chimney which I had already explained was 100% not allowed by the HOA and if they couldn't do that they wouldn't be able to perform the install. I told them to cancel the order and I would keep my current service.\n\nI decided to follow-up directly with Directv and received confirmation that they could 100% strap the dish and they asked a whole bunch of other questions regarding the installation that the people at First Choice never considered. Lesson learned, from now on I'll deal directly with the company than using a reseller.
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	Absolutely horrible company. Do not use their services. If I could give negative stars I would. They give zero customer service and do not even care about your frustrations with being mislead. They will do nothing to help resolve the situation. What you signed up for at your local fair is not what you will receive. Not even close. You will pay more out of pocket expenses than you should and will be left frustrated. I wish I had read reviews before doing any type of business transaction with them
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	What a huge mistake. Should have looked at their reviews on the internet before signing up with these asshats! Totally lied about buying out early termination fees from Dish TV even though it states that on the contract I signed. They installed the DIRECTV the next day as promised but that is where their customer service ends. I had to call DIRECTV a week after the install for a pixelated picture on all TV's. The official DIRECTV installer said these guys do a half assed job of installation just to get their fee and after that it's "you lose sucker".  The DIRECTV installer basically had to redo everything they did to make all the TV's work properly. Now that DIRECTV is owned by AT&T I am going to lodge any and all complaints available to me with AT&T regarding the crappy install and fraudulent business practices used by this contractor. I will also look at whatever government agency regulates these clowns and file complaints. I will be at the next Home and Garden show in our area to have a face to face conversation with their office manager that made all these promises and failed to deliver.
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	We were approached by what I now know to be sales people from this company at the Arizona Home and Garden Fair. \n\nBefore I go on, let me make one thing clear. I had been prior to meeting these folks contemplating switching to Directv for quite some time because a) I was curious, b) I disliked by current provider (Cox) and c) I had friends who were long time customers of Directv and highly recommended it. Also, I am now still a Directv customer and really happy and would highly recommend Directv.\n\n A big part of what we discussed with these people were important deciding factors for us in deciding to jump on and do the change. But much of it turned out to be false promises:\n - they could not handle a simple task of working with us to schedule an install date, they lied about how soon they could install\n - they lied about the equipment we would get\n - they lied about how much of an early termination fee they would pay (even though I had it in writing from their own staff)\n - they did not respond to phone calls well and when you did get them on the phone they were extremely rude and dismissive and were very clear that they did not want to bother with me and tried multiple times to get me to hang up.\n - they lied about the services that the tech would do when he came to the house\n\nThese people introduced themselves as being employees of Directv which only after the fact I learned they were not. They basically will say anything to get you to switch.\n\nI did call Directv on two occasions when I was trying to resolve things and the person I spoke to was extremely professional and was a big part in including other higher ups who apologized for the bad service we had gotten and made up for it. Huge kudos to them (this kind of customer service is what I expected after hearing my friends talk about their experiences). The person I spoke to at Directv also did file a complaint and mentioned to me that this was not the first time people had complained about this company.\n\nOne of the things Directv asked me to do was to call the number for First Choice and try and get them to resolve these issues. If that would not work, I was to call Directv again. When I confronted a person from First Choice on the phone (who claimed she was the manager), and said that I had two witnesses that could testify to the fact that her salespeople (whom I had named and described) had promised us things they were now saying they would not own up to, she responded by saying that they would just come up with other witnesses to counter and basically call me a liar even though I had these things in writing. \n\nThese people will lie through their teeth and say anything to get you to do business with them. This is unfortunate for Directv as it gives them bad rep and they seem to be a decent company (at least we've been very happy with them so far).
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	At the San Diego Car Show, my friend was corralled into their booth - they made a deal that seemed to save her money - I had talked to a young black lady from the same type service on the other side of the area, who walked over with me. The creep at the booth told her she "couldn't be there" - and she stated that she had walked over with me from her area, and didn't know my friend and I were together.  The creep grabbed her arm and turned her around - totally unacceptable behavior.  My friend and I went home with her info, and my offer for service - I read the reviews on First Choice Communications, and she cancelled her order, and I didn't return the salespersons call.\n           After this, suddenly I am getting spam calls every morning, a virus on my computer, spam e-mails - I have read other complaints about this company.  The two salespeople at the first booth seem to be complete criminals - one got the feeling you were being "played" the entire time - from the phony "he gave me a ring, he is my fiance" - between the two, apparently to break the ice and invoke compassion towards them - to the "contract" that really doesn't spell out the services.
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	I will make this review short and sweet.\nSwindlers and one douche bag Liar salesman.\nI do not know how these guys operate in Arizona. But, if you see their tent at a Fair its best to stay away.
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	DON'T DO IT!!!!!!!!!!!!  Unfortunately, I went with this company before checking them out on the Internet.  I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, but when I was told she would call me to set up the Internet account, I waited 45 minutes and no call.  So I called Direct TV directly and set it up myself, and then CenturyLink and canceled my order with First Communications.  She did finally call me......an hour and 45 minutes late.  I figured if my first experience with them was like that, I might never get the Internet installed - like some of the other reviewers.  \n\nThey lost my trust when the salesman told me they were a member of the Better Business Bureau - "Yeah - I have the sign hanging right here on the wall!"  Not true, per the BBB's website!!
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	I have to choose  at least 1 star to write. What a scam company this is, multiple calls from Larry from 2 different states. There field reps are scammers. I am so thankful I have great neighbors who where able to give me and proper authorities there video of these 2 guys coming to there houses. Sales reps gave me fake phone numbers. Mike Davis and Joe. We will see you both soon. Larry how do you sleep at night?
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	We have been given the run around since we signed up with First Choice Communications at our state fair! They took our $100.00 and we have not received anything since! We continuously call the rep James Marlnee leaving numerous messages for the past two weeks and he never returns our calls! \nCalled the company directly and spoke with a guy named Sung who also PROMISED he would help, also does not return calls!\nThey are crooks and Direct TV is getting a bad name by using them as a retailer!\nTHEY DESERVE 0 STARS!\n\nBUYER BEWARE!!!!
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	So this Authorized Dealer for Direct TV is full of liars! I contacted BBB. You misrepresent the  of legitimate Companies. I was just appalled by the way they take money from the $40.00 application fee to switch my Uverse to Direct TV? Also charge my credit card $74.93 When out of the mouth of John W. was that our card was going to be only a charge of 99 cents and we were not going to be charged for 2 weeks? The card was charged June 18 the very next day. I was told I could get that back the $40.00 by some girl in the office. That an email would be sent to process that refund, that sounded ridiculous to me!  Then she called back and said no that her Manager would not approve this. But we would get a discount off our bill. I found out the way that is done they used my name in a improper way in a referral program. Why would I refer anyone to these Liars? Cedric is a LIAR as I have read the other reviews about this Company and it seems they continue to do this over & over. What is it going to take for them not mis represent ATT. Did ATT buy Direct TV?\nThe Installation process was also horrible, some guy named Paul with no ID badge. Thank God legitimate Installers with badges corrected all of the mistakes that First Communications from Arizona made. Just do not EVER USE AUTHORIZED DEALER NMED FIRST COMMUNICATIONS FROM ARIZONIA.
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	Under no circumstances should you contract with this company.  They hang out at fairs and try and talk weary visitors into deals which they can not deliver.   The. They tell you to give them money-cash or they can't get you this great deal.  The deal they are saying is not available and when you call Direct TV they say there is nothing they can do as you don't with them and not directly with direct TV.  Beware!!!!!!!!!
F-ZpQbPluGcVmcI3jM_TfQ	They are lucky to even get one star. Promised to come between 8-12. No one showed. When I called to see what happened, they had no record of it. Horrible customer service! Previously had Cox for years with no issues. Going to cancel direct tv and go back to cox.
