mLwM-h2YhXl2NCgdS84_Bw	Great soul food period , it's get no better, come and get it. They have lamb too !! Chicken, ribs, bbq chicken and sides to boot !! Pure awesomeness !!
mLwM-h2YhXl2NCgdS84_Bw	South Florida resides on the east side of Charlotte inside of a convenience store....a little sketchy but the food is really good.  They serve breakfast all day(chicken and waffles, fish and grits, etc) lunch and dinner.  They are grilling chicken, ribs, and pork chops right in the parking lot and although I haven't tried the ribs, the grilled pork chops and chicken are perfectly cooked.  I also tried the fried chicken, green beans, lima beans, potato salad, stewed squash, and seafood salad...all excellent!  The only thing I wasn't impressed with was the Mac n cheese.  They also offer homemade desserts, fruit and salad.  Great addition to the soul food scene!
mLwM-h2YhXl2NCgdS84_Bw	So this place is in the c-store. A little skeptical of the atmosphere but go in the day time and it's alright.  My food was good . I had turkey wings yams and green beans.  Very good turkey wings. Yams were not to sweet just the way I like it.  Will try again.  Sometimes taking a chance works!
mLwM-h2YhXl2NCgdS84_Bw	Amazing food!! I can't believe it almost taste like my 100 year old grandfathers food, God rest his soul. Even though these guys are displaced and have opened up shop in Nubian Queens Restaurant, they did not let that come across in the food  they prepared! I'm a patron from here on out!
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	All your essential Filipino needs in a little store on the borderline of Henderson.\n\nNo fresh fish or meat. Although, they keep a good variety frozen towards the back of the store. \nI love how they always have pork belly when I need to get my chef on!\n\nRecently just opened a restaurant a couple months ago. Pretty much just took over another suite and slapped a door in between the two. \nFood looks amazing though so I'll have to try it out next time.
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	It's a grocery store with all the filipino grocery items all packed into this tiny place.  Very clean, organized, and the place  didnt have any overpowering fishy aroma like other places Ive been to. The prices are a little higher though, but I still save $$ on gas an save time going to the places on Maryland. Glad I stumbled upon it since its closer to where I live. Good thing since I love halo halo I have a place to run to nearby that has all the ingredients for it!
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	Small, convenient, Filipino store on the east side of town! \n\nLots of ingredients, canned goods, fresh and frozen produce, snacks, and baked goods to choose from! \n\nFairly clean and organized, helpful and friendly staff! \n\nThey also have phone cards and offer a balikbayan (big box of goods to be sent to the PI) service!
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	Love that this store is in my neighborhood. It's a quick drive from my house and alleviates me from having to drive all the way to Seafood City. The prices are reasonable too! \n\nThe staff is super nice and always helpful. Thank you!
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	This is a small, but full Asian store! It's got all the basics and it is about 5 minutes from my home. It's great for when I need something that can't be found at the usual grocery store. Their prices are also very good, some of the best in town for Asian goods. I still need to go to some of the bugger stores for more specific items, but for its location, good prices, and well-stocked shelves, it is a store I keep returning to.
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	Just got back and it's a nice little store. I never look to my right when driving on Boulder, but I guess I had time to look this time. I spotted something filipino and drove in. Nice little shop. It feels like everything barely fits inside but it works. I took pictures of things I wouldn't see at seafood city. I found these cheese cake kit kats that I have only seen in Japan. I haven't even seen them in any Japanese markets here. \n\nDidn't try the food next door though. Overall nice little selection you can't find at Seafood city. Good experience. I don't expect customer service here though its just a small store.
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	Convenient for people who are too far away from Seafood City and live near the area.
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	We come to this store often solely because it's close to home, so it's really convenient. Joshan's has all of the essential Asian and/or Filipino items that you may or may not have forgotten to pick up while you were at the always busy Seafood City. It's a small store with narrow aisles, but everything is there if you take the time to look.\n\nThey carry fresh vegetables, noodles, sauces, seasonings, etc. Joshan's also sells my favorite Magnolia ice creams as well as a bunch of Asian chips and snacks that remind me of my childhood. There is just a good assortment of everything. During my last visit, I also discovered that they carry a few products from Hawai'i. I've always known that they sell a variety of the Hawaiian Sun drinks, but it was just brought to my attention that they also have things like Zippy's famous chili! What! Oh, how I miss my Hawai'i!\n\nOverall, a good place to shop for what you need if you're in the area! The prices are decent, but just a reminder that there is a $10 minimum for credit/debit. If you don't plan on spending $10, have some cash on hand!
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	I've been going to this mini mart since they began. Over time I've seen how they began and grew so is the rise and fall of their customer service. It seems the more bigger they get the more they treat loyal customers like piece of ****!\n\nI always buy tons of stuff here and one of them is the Veggie Egg Rolls but they always try to be stingy on the dipping sauce. Come on now? Really? After supporting you throughout these years? \n\nIt's okay for immediate needs or convenience stops but if you want total customer service and satisfaction you won't find it here.
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	We love having this little store close to our house. From rice to fresh veggies, to balut and salted eggs, they have a lot of goodies.\nLots of Filipino products, great prices.
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	Not my first choice when it comes to asian markets but it is in my neighborhood and easy to get to for those on the east side/hendo side of town.\n\nThe store is small and when walking through with my hunny and child, it can be a little cramped. \n\nHowever, what I do love about this place is that they definitely have what I need, when I need it. You will find your filipino staples here with absolutely no problem. So if you are in need of a few items to pick up, then this is definitely the place to go.\n\nAlso depending on the day, they have an assortment of warm/hot food to choose from. These have been surprisingly good.
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	Cute little market off of Russell & Boulder Hwy. It's   a little tight inside. Very difficult to maneuver from isle to isle. I did find an organic all natural coconut water in the small refrigerator towards the back of the store, some tamarind candy, and plenty of soup mixes. When I got to the counter, the young girl doesn't even acknowledge your presence. No hello, hi, how are you?....nothing! She looked down then began to ring up my items. It was a little awkward. Note to the owner, teach this young lady some mannerism in customer service. Always greet every person that walks into your establishment. Greeting your customers goes a long way. Needless to say, I will not return. \nI went next door shortly to check out their new restaurant, but the food was just swimming in fat and the smell was not appetizing. I was hoping to try out some of the food? :( \nI'll continue to go to the new Mabuhay Market next to Sunset Station, it's so much cleaner and bigger. And yes the owners greet you. :)
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	A little oasis of pinoy/Filipino culture on the edge of town. \n\nThey have: fresh noodles, fresh vegetables, herbs, frozen meats, juices [Guayabano, Calamansi, Mogu Mogu, coconut juice, etc], spice packs, lumpia, shumai, BBQ chicken & pork skewers, sausages [frozen & dried], purses, beauty products & soaps, magazines, snacks [cookies, coconut fruit jellies, chips, peanuts]  and more. It's a small space but they pack a lot of items in, with much of the fish and meat available in opaque coolers. It's worth digging! A package of pork belly chunks for under $2 in this neighborhood is a nice find. They also have various types of Pinoy bbq that look awesome, but I have not tried yet. Their peanuts are great, though!    \n\nI admit, the vegetables sometimes have an off day. But it's not often, and what's available can be hard to find on this side of town! The selection of vegetables alone makes it worth going; lots of fresh herbs, bitter melon and various other yummies.\n\n+ Hello Panda cookies. The boy was very happy to find them on the shelves there. :} The little cookies have crisp outer shells with cute panda characters printed on them and creamy insides with various flavors. I've had them before and loved them. \n+ Coconut fruit jellies! Reminds me of shopping at a Korean grocery when I was really young and stocking up something like these :] They're juicy, chewy little jellies in portable cups. They  can be a little messy, but they're refreshing and fun! And really low in calories for a sweet treat, so it's a nice thing to pack in your work-day lunch for a little sweetness.  \n\nIt's a useful little store in a shopping center with a circle K, Not as impressive as a store in china town, but it's a respectable little operation on this side of town!
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	Reading the prior reviews, they are pretty accurate as to how small this store is layout wise, and how tight the aisles are. I came in to get a Kalbi korean BBQ marinade, and they had a good selection including one that I like to use. They have a few items in a freezer like pre-made lumpia as well as others. The store actually looks like they carry quite a bit in that small space.\n\nI'll be back to shop again. Friendly people working the counter.
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	Very small, but packed full of staples. There is also a small produce section which looks pretty clean but I never bought anything from there before. I don't see any fresh fish or meat. All frozen.\n\nEvery weekend, come early for their fresh vegetable and beef rolls. Delicious and runs out very quickly! I almost had to punch an old Filipino lady to get my fix! \n\nRight next door to a delicious Filipino restaurant.
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	Okay. What a trip.\n\nSo, I copied and paste the address from Yelp into my GPS, and was taken on a wild goose chase. Had me behind the silverbowl, cutting through neighborhoods, all kinds of crap.\n\nIt is in the circle K parking lot, however, it is behind all that. It is closer to the Roberto's and the salon/check cashing place.\n\nTight squeeze doesn't even begin to describe how small the isles are here. An employee was stalking the shelves, and her and I could barely squeeze by one another to fit. The shelves are crammed with items, and pricing is hard to figure out, because there is just so many things. \n\nI found the boba that I was looking for (a quick boil, that takes 5 minutes to make). I grabbed a few bags of those, but their debit/credit card policy is $10 or get charged a fee. \n\nLuckily, I found a sweet roll that my daughter really loves. No one really acknowledged me, kind of lame... IF you can manage the tight squeeze, and you know exactly what you want, and where it is, you shouldn't have a problem.
DiA78qPtp6rfRNdomzjBbw	With this little Asian market being so close to home who needs to drive all the way to Seafood City .Unless im in the mood for Jollibee but thats a different story ;). Most of your Filipino and Asian staples crammed in this little store . Yes  little. Usually never a crowd so its not a big deal for me because if it was I'd be a little uncomforatble bumping uglies with strangers , the aisles are that narrow . Like I said its usually never bursting with traffic so its not a problem . All kinds of goodies including snacks , sauces , fresh produce and frozen goodies like meats ice cream and mochi ! Yum mochi , great i want some mango mochi maybe ill go get some :)
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Decent location in what I would consider the not so fabulous section of Mesa. The lady at the counter was super friendly and I was in and out in no time with my $.69 Gatorade Peace A town, I'm out of here!
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Worst pharmacy ever. I have been here multiple times (I thought maybe they were just having an off day). The people that work in the pharmacy (with the exception of 1 or 2 employees) are rude and unprofessional. One lady always has a toothpick in her mouth, ew. Two different employees, on two different visits, have completely ignored me while I was talking to them. \n\nOn today's visit, I was told the prescription would be ready in 20-30 minutes. I arrived an hour and 10 minutes later and it wasn't ready, no apology they wouldn't even an acknowledgement that they were running behind....nothing. \n\nThe pharmacist, Phil I believe, was nice today and looked into getting me a different brand because the price was so high on what was prescribed by the dr but I had to argue with the other lady forever to get her to take the time to ask the pharmacist. \n\nOn a previous visit, they quoted me 2 hours for a bottle of cough syrup that was already filled (so all they had to do was put a sticker on the bottle) and there wasn't a single person waiting in the store for their prescriptions. They guy that night was also extremely rude. \n\nI wish these people would remember that not everyone is coming in for their meds that they take on a daily basis....many people are coming in because they are sick and feel like crap....treat people with some kindness and respect!!!!
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	This is not a place to go for your prescriptions.  I was in line and waiting to get my prescriptions and it was a long line, mind you.  While in line a woman who could not speak english came up to me had to have her daughter translate her spanish.  She tells me her mom was in front of me but sat down so she was going to stand in front of me.  She was nowhere in sight while I was in line.  I explained I had been STANDING in line for 15 minutes and she could go to the end of the line like everyone else.  When it was my turn to head to the check out (after about 20-30 minutes of waiting to PICK UP a prescription that was ALREADY READY, the pharmacy tech called this woman in Spanish and said something to her and she went in front of me.  Not only have I been a Walgreens customer for my prescriptions since 1992, I am now taking my business and prescriptions elsewhere.  Terribly long lines and blatant disregard for visibly injured customers on crutches standing in line.  BYE WALGREENS,
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	I'm visiting Mesa from Denver and I'm burning up. Craving cold ice tea I came to Walgreens.  Bought it. And left feeling accomplished
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	I cannot believe that there are so many negative reviews here. It seems ludicrous compared to my experience with the healthcare clinic.\n\nI made an appointment online for 2PM, and the NP saw me on time so I didn't have to wait around forever. I don't think I was there longer than 20 minutes. The NP (his name was Guy!) was quick and attentive. He was very kind and personable, and he got me the right prescription and sent me on my way.\n\nThe pharmacy staff as well as the store staff were also very pleasant. The store was clean and well stocked and I had no issues whatsoever.\n\nOne of the NPs even called me a few days later to make sure everything was good. I've been to Walgreen healthcare centers plenty of times for various reasons and that had never happened before.\n\nThis store was the only one with appointments open, which is why I picked it even though it is on the other side of town from where I work and live. From now on this will be my primary Walgreens healthcare center!
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Totally disagree with the negative reviews of this place. I actually had my prescriptions transferred here because it's close to my work and the pharmacy department has such better customer service than the Walgreens by my house.
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Moved across town and needed refills.  The pharmacist was crabby and also told me I could only transfer 5 prescriptions (I moved from Gilbert to Mesa).  I had only transferred 3 at this point and they wouldn't help me at all.   They said it was a "Walgreen's Policy" which I know is not right.    Now I am having to drive over to Gilbert to obtain my refills.  \n\nDisgusting and disappointing, will definitely go elsewhere.
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Went there today looking for some new Wet n Wild eyeshadow quads which they didn't have in yet.  Thought, hey I wonder if they have any NYX products.  So, I asked the employee who'd been following me and watching me like a hawk since I got into the cosmetics department -middle aged caucasian brunette - and she narrowed her eyes at me and said "no, that's dollar store stuff!" then smirked.  WTF..can the attitude lady.  They sell it at Ulta and Target..although not high-end, it's not dollar store.  Incidentally that was a yes or no question.  What a great way to start my birthday..with an embittered racist minimum wage employee.  Won't be shopping here in the future; though I live nearby.
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	This pharmacy is the absolute worst .. Do yourself a favor and take your prescriptions elsewhere
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Walgreens is Walgreens.  This location is a bit sketchy depending on the time of day you go.   I have had people ask me for money outside and the parking lot is always very busy.  However, the staff is way helpful!  I was looking for travel size contact solution.  They pointed me in the right direction then had someone check on me to make sure that I found what I needed.  Good thing too because I would have left not seeing it.   I even got rung up in the cosmetic isle!
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	The pharmacy here is a joke. .. I have had several occasions of bad service here on top of one very rude pharmacist. ..Go across the street and save yourself the headache!
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	Don't go for you medications.. They tell you one time take twice as long as they say and you get to watch all the people that come in after you leave with their prescriptions when they wait also.  Walmart or frys is a much better option.  I've been useing Walgreen's for a long time and have been messing up lately. Very unpleasant experience.  The need to fix whatever they broke in November when problems started
aBGT2NQ9fSesoB93-eVj5w	This is a pretty standard Walgreens.  They have a pretty decent selection, its a bit bigger than the one by my house.  The guy that checked me out was pretty friendly.
jCvnGFx3nWX51OkDW8mSsg	Whatever you do, don't get the honey garlic meatball keabs. Nor the sweet chili ones. Nor those spicy chicken taquitos. I know your belly's growling and you could eat almost anything man but TRUST me, you're gonna regret it.\n\nThe Big Gulp, tho? GO FOR IT!
jCvnGFx3nWX51OkDW8mSsg	Huge selection of hangover foods, parking spots and a sneaky post office I'm forced to go to often. Slushies on tap. Taquitos. You know the drill.
jCvnGFx3nWX51OkDW8mSsg	Why have the prices for the individual sour candies gone up? 0.35 cents for 1 sour key..seriously guys? 0.10 cents for a mini sour key? This was disappointing to see. Everything else is overpriced as well..go down the street to the dollarama if you are desperate for chips, chocolate or candy. \n\n7 Eleven is the only place I go for a last minute lottary ticket and that is about it. The food is crappy, the junk food is overpriced and the fountain drinks/slushies just aren't what they used to be 10 years ago.
1N6_FgS6nq5eT_3x4MXm4A	Really great ice cubes made from Reverse Osmosis water.  Super nice guy bought the place and it is already better.  There is even Thrifty ice cream which I will try next time I'm in.  This location used to be randomly open, now it is a real business you can count on!
1N6_FgS6nq5eT_3x4MXm4A	I used to go to this place for snow cones and ice cream when I was a little girl. Lived in the same house my whole life (right across the street from this establishment) and one day I guess a new owner came in and ruined this place and gave it a bad rep. I stopped going. Rude staff. Nasty and dirty I wouldn't even walk in there if I was thirsty. But NOW. I don't know the name of the owner but this place is BACK! SO CLEAN. Organized. SHAVED ICE! BOBA! ICE CREAM! IT'S THE BEST SHAVED ICE YOU CAN GET! The flavors. HAND. MADE. That's all you need to know to come in. I come here multiple times a week now! Do not hesitate to come in and cool off here!
1N6_FgS6nq5eT_3x4MXm4A	The best customer service topped off with amazing clean ice,  none of that white resin at the bottom of your glass like grocery store ice.
1N6_FgS6nq5eT_3x4MXm4A	If you drink gallons of water like my family does, you have to pick up a free standing water cooler and fill up here $.00.25 per gallon and ice is the best for daily or any occasion.\nCheaper than Fry's or any convenience store.\nThe staff at 43rd Ave and Cactus and 35th Ave and Northern are always friendly both have carts, saves on back pain.
sTfs8QwqzcgTe9GFz99FGQ	Love this wine store.\nStopped in for a wine tasting on a Friday night a while back and have been coming back ever since.  \nWine tasting selections are always good and the staff is always friendly and helpful in selecting the perfect wine for any occasion.
sTfs8QwqzcgTe9GFz99FGQ	I'd heard of the Wine Cellar, but never stopped in before because it's a little outside my regular commute. I was picking up dinner next door last night and finally had the pleasure. It's a relatively small space, so I can't compare with other places I've shopped, but the selection seems great.\n\nI had an idea of what I was looking for, but didn't see it. I ended up speaking with the owner for a while about hard ciders and loved learning that they refuse to stock any varieties that don't disclose where they get their fruit. That's a big plus in my book. He also offered to order something specific if I knew I wanted multiples - a great thing to keep in mind for those times when we can manage to stock up. He was so pleasant and knowledgeable that I'll be making a point of adjusting my routes through Verona to add the Wine Cellar to our errand trips. \n\nAs I've said so many times in my reviews, I feel small business is the way to go. I'll go out of my way to support a spot that offers this kind of service every time.
sTfs8QwqzcgTe9GFz99FGQ	This wine shop is small in size but vast in character. Rick can tell you a lot about each wine without any pressure to buy a certain bottle. There's no pretension and few mass produced labels. A great independent small town shop to support!
sTfs8QwqzcgTe9GFz99FGQ	The best place to buy wine in the Madison Area. Super friendly staff and wine you won't find anywhere else.
sTfs8QwqzcgTe9GFz99FGQ	Since discovering the Papa Murphy's literally right next door to the Verona Wine Cellar, my husband and I have talked about stopping in. We finally took the leap last night while picking up a pizza. \n\nThe place is small, but well laid out and very well stocked. We found items here that we've had trouble finding in Madison. We're big fans of Lakefront Brewing and of the Moscow Mule. Verona Wine Cellar was able to help us make the best drinks with our recent passions in mind. We found multiple bottles of Roarin' Dans Maple Rum from Lakefront Brewing (usually we can only find 1 bottle at Steve's) and it came with directions to make the most delicious drink - The Mooncusser. I also managed to find a 4-pack of Crabbie's Alcoholic Ginger beer. A beer I've only been able to find at Ha Long Bay on the East side. Most ginger beers that are found in grocery or liquor stores are non-alcoholic and very sharp in ginger taste. Crabbies is smooth and much more like a soothing combination of ginger ale and beer. Plus, adding vodka and a lime makes for a very potent Moscow Mule.\n\nNeedless to say, we'll be stopping in again!
sTfs8QwqzcgTe9GFz99FGQ	Such a fun place.  A large selection of wines, beers, non-alcoholic beers/wines, mixers and a small selection of Hard-A.  Free wine tastings on Friday at 4 and beer tastings every third Thursday.  \n\nThe guy working was awesome.  Had a great sense of humor and very willing to help me.  I am very indecisive so I just had to take everything in at first but he threw out a few suggestions.  I ended up with a pumpkin ale by Smuttynose and a coffee stout and I can't remember who made that one.  But it has coffee and that is all I care about.  \n\nThey did have a lot of local beers, Ale Asylum, Lakefront, the usual.  I was impressed with their Rogue selection, a favorite of mine.  I would go back just to explore.
sTfs8QwqzcgTe9GFz99FGQ	This place is seriously amazing. Great selection WONDERFUL and knowledgeable service. Love stopping in here.
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	I originally gave them two stars but since then they lost another RX and had no answer when asked what took so long to fill it. This place needs some training on business practice.
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	Last time using this stinking pharmacy.  Always take longer than they say, never enough staff. I am writing this now listening to my young child cough repeatedly because this useless location couldn't get her prescription ready since NOON YESTERDAY. the had ALL DAY to get it done. Now I have to call this morning when they open to see if someone could maybe do their job.\n\nNEVER AGAIN!
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	This pharmacy used to be good but about 9 months ago it has gone downhill.  Always a 30 minute line.  They've lost my prescription multiple times.  I always hear customers in line complaining of lost or delayed prescriptions.  The staff always acts like they are doing you a favor.  It's really sad.
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	A pretty much generic Walgreens in a pretty much generic shopping center in the large sprawl that is the greater Phoenix area...\n\nHas everything you would expect to find.
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	Worst. Pharmacy. Ever. No matter what time of the day you go picking up pills can take anywhere from 20 minutes to 40 minutes, constantly get text messages at my pills are ready to be picked up and when I go they said I'll be a 15 minute wait while they fill my prescription(s), and on the off chance that they already when I do go to pick them up they only have one of my prescriptions ready. Awful pharmacy, awful staff.
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	This is the worst Walgreens pharmacy I've ever been to. They are rude and do not like their jobs.\nI wouldn't recommend this Walgreens.
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	Skip using the pharmacy at this location!!!  Long wait time..  Too many other pharmacy options to deal with this!!!
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	If I could leave less I would! \nI sat in drive thru for 10 mins with out some one even acknowledging me! They are awful!!!
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	It's a literal crap shoot on what you'll get at this location.  Some days great people, others are pronounce in the fact that they don't care about customer service, courtesy or speed of service.  The last three trips here have been the latter, so I thought I would post about it.   Clearly poorly managed.
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	Pharmacy is definitely not my favorite place. They cant get my insurance right then make me wait in another line after screwing up. Not a pleasant experience.
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	Don't waste your time using this pharmacy. The people who work here have absolutely no idea of time management. Spending 25 minutes in line through the drive through is not acceptable.
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	I swore to myself a few years ago that I would never use a Walgreens pharmacy again. When I moved out to Arizona, Walgreens was the most convenient place to go, and believe me I was NOT happy about it. \n\nHowever, this Walgreens is unlike any other! The service is friendly, the pharmacy is fast, and they usually have my prescription in stock! They worked really hard with my insurance and my doctor to figure out some miscommunications that occurred a few months ago. While I'll never understand why all Walgreens are so bad at having my medicine in stock, I am elated that this one almost always has it! This location has renewed my faith in Walgreens!
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	This Walgreens pharmacy is horrible! I literally have no clue what they do here. I have never been here once and had my prescription ready. You can try and call ahead to get an ETA or even give them a whole day.....and yup it won't be filled. They are totally lost here! They need someone new to come in and run this pharmacy properly.
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	I get my prescriptions from this location. It's close, convenient, and they make it really easy to get automatic refills. The staff at the pharmacy are very friendly and helpful!
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	I use this Walgreens constantly. If you are in the vicinity of this Walgreens and desire a clean establishment with an assortment of food, consumer, and houseware items - this is your place!\n\nI have also used the photo kiosks - both in store and uploading them first online - and let me tell you that it ROCKS! Much easier than trying to get your color printer at home to do the photos "right". And for 15 cents a print - you can't go wrong!\n\nTIP: For photo printing you can upload online to this location with SAME day pick-up for most sizes! Really convenient!
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	No complaints. Friendly people and great pharmacy. All at the corner of happy and healthy!!
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	Great service and Lisa was so nice!  I needed something very important for the following day at work.  Walgreen's didn't have it, but Lisa improvised for me and "found" what I needed after all. Thank you!
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	Worst experience ever! Pharmacy has no customer service skills. No one ever knows what is going on and they just pass you along. They are not helpful at all.  Pharmacist Laura also has no people skills, no eye contact.  Does not even greet you or say thank you. The only person who remotely is helpful is Aimee who is a tech. We will be switching pharmacies.
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	I'll drive out of my way to avoid this Walgreens location. They turn over their staff more than a cook turns flapjacks on a Saturday morning. The pharmacy has progressively got worse in the last 2 years. There are times when they don't even open as scheduled! They used to have a couple of ladies in the pharmacy who were actually pleasant. They are long since gone, replaced with ogres. They also cannot seem to keep a full time pharmacist, as they seem to always have "fill ins". Do yourself a favor and get to know the CVS down the road, or pick another Walgreens, avoiding this one.
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	It's your typical Walgreens. Where everything is convenient and everyone is friendly.  Good place to stop went you're in a hurry.. convenience.
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	Always friendly staff and helpful. We get all if our prescriptions there and within a month of going there, one if the pharmacy staff already knew me and whenever I go for prescriptions, she just has them ready! Would recommend the staff and the pharmacy!
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	Had to come 3 days in a row to pick up an inhaler that was not filled even though pharmacy kept calling that is ready for pick up. What a waste of time. Female pharmacist also questions my pediatrician's professional judgment.  I am definitely switching pharmacy locations
A8y3yc_-_cDrHiApqJlx-w	Awesome service in the photo department, fast, friendly, helpful.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Just stayed there for a wedding...room was ok, but the toilet was very noisy...when I opened the tank to see if I could make it quieter it looks like the fill valve hadn't been changed in 10 years.\nThey have an "Eco" thing where you can decline having your sheets changed and in exchange you get a $5 voucher to use at the food and beverage sites at the hotel...warning...you can't use it on alcohol but they don't tell you that...I learned that when the bartender told me.  Rather than telling me that, he should have said "I am not supposed to take this, but I will for you" then take the $5 out of his tip jar...I would have tipped him the $5 back for good customer service.  Instead he left a bad taste in my mouth and now I am Yelping about it.\nOne more thing about the $5 incentive...I didn't realize that meant that housekeeping would not visit the room at all and we were left without new coffee cups and coffee and "glasses" (which are cheap cheap cheap plastic cups).  I think for the price of the room and their "Eco" programs, they would be able to put a few glass glasses in the room.\nGood location and an easy walk to other restaurants, bars , hotels and sites.\nParking was kinda pricey but not unreasonable for  downtown in a major city.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	We stayed here for pleasure, not business and it was great. We had the Astros staying at our hotel (what's up Brett Myers and J Happ?) so it's got to be pretty classy, right? Parking was expensive. If you self-park in the garage, you don't have in-out privileges and valet is $22/night. But that's the price you pay for staying in the city I guess. We were able to walk to PNC Park as well as other shops/restaurants in the theater district. Staff was great, rooms were clean and our view of the river was beautiful. \n\nMy only complaint was our neighbor's shower let off a high pitched, very loud whine when it was turned on. It woke us both up early. We were able to get back to sleep and we heard them fixing it later in the afternoon but it was annoying at the time.\n\nOther than that, I would stay here again. We got a great deal.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Nice hotel.  Check-in was extremely smooth and quick.  Hotel is very clean.  Room is nice.  Shower drain kind of sucks but I can deal with that.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	My wife and I stayed here for a business event Sept. 25th - 28th. Upon check-in they refused to honor our Govt. Rate, even though the event advertised it. A loss of $150.00 to me. They said it was booked up at Govt. Rate, even though only 4 of us were there from the Govt. Next the room was no at all conducive to sleep. Loud banging (mechanical) at 2am, 4am, and 6am and throughout the morning. The room was dusty and needed some vacuuming of the edges. You would think that the Hotel would clean the place up when they had a convention of Environmental Services (Housekeeping) Managers and Directors. The mattress had a big stain on the side of it, could have been blood or wine.......just looked nasty. We couldn't wait to leave. After we got home my wife discovered bites on her......we are hoping it is not bed bugs. \nThe restaurant was very expensive......$60+ $ for breakfast. Food was Meh......I have had way better for less $. We do not recommend this Hotel for anyone and don't ever intend to return. We are SPG members and we have made our issues known to them but, they have refused to give any refund.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	This Westin is deplorable. We are SPG gold members, so naturally we've become accustomed to certain things. We get in on a Tuesday night. We originally booked a king room, we got a two double bed room. A 6'2" man can't sleep in a double. We get to our room, the lamps don't work, the sheets on both beds were dirty, and the drain in the tub doesn't drain. No problem, it happens. Once I told them the next morning, they moved us no problem. In the process of moving rooms, I mistakenly leave some clothing items in the room. After realizing, I call Housekeeping. After calling all afternoon and the next morning, I finally get ahold of the Housekeeping manager. She tells me that our previous room hasn't been cleaned yet (aka that room has been untouched for over 24 hours) and she would go retrieve my things and bring them to me in our new room. Hours go by, no word. At this point, we are preparing to check out. I speak with a front desk girl, explaining that I need those items and we are preparing to check out. She immediately called down to Housekeeping, where the Housekeeping manager again tells us she will be to our new room with my things immediately.\n30 minutes go by, nothing. We are forced to leave to catch our flight. Im already highly upset about this ordeal. Once landed, I call and speak with the hotel manager who apologizes, and says they will email me and send me my things at no cost. 2 days later, I've still heard nothing. \nThis Westin's management is atrocious. False promises, unclean rooms. Doesn't get much worse than that. We obviously will not be staying here again.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Great location, close to the convention center and many fine restaurants in the Strip District. Love the Heavenly beds and the shower with multiple heads. Spacious, clean & attractive rooms. \n\nLoses a star because the free internet is slow as hell, clearly to entice you to pay for faster speeds. Ugh. If I'm on a business trip, I want to be able to work in my room, and having to pay extra for the privilege of working efficiently is not cool.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I was in town for an interview and didn't pay for my room, but the corporate rate they got was $97.  Pretty awesome.  Self parking (I think) was $8 per day.  Cheap!  This is what you expect from a Westin--that heavenly scent, Heavenly bed with soft sheets, and Heavenly bath towels.   This particular Westin uses an energy-saving program.  They'll tell you to insert your key card when you get in the door of your room because it powers the lights and AC.  I'm not a fan of that so I request two keys--I insert one and keep the AC running while I am out of the room and use the other key to get into the room.  Sorry, but I'm not returning to a hot hotel room and waiting for it to cool down!  \n\nI was disappointed to see they didn't offer complimentary bottled water in the SPG rooms...I guess the reality of the economy is hitting them and they are cutting back on that.  Bummer.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	After looking at the hotel online I was excited, the pictures looked new and very nice. I was in town attending a conference at the convention center so along with how great everything looked, you couldn't beat the location. \n\nHowever, I had the absolute worst hotel experience at the Pittsburgh Westin. I am a Starwood Preferred Guest member and up until now have had great experiences, but this one was so bad it really makes me question the integrity of the brand and I am hesitant to stay at another Starwood establishment. \n\nEven tonight as I try to log into my SPG to see if my points for being "conservative" with the room were updated, I can't logon to the site as "The system is temporarily unavailable." I should also note I have photographs of everything, because I couldn't believe how bad the stay was. \n\n1. The terrible experience happened before I even arrived. When I googled the hotel, accusations of bed bugs appeared on both Yelp.com and Bedbegregistry.com - and the hotel had yet to take the time to respond. A simple detail that if someone was paying attention they would be able to resolve. \n\n2. I arrived at the hotel after a 7+ hour drive only to find out that the bathroom in my hotel room was broken. After two calls to Guest Services, about 30 minutes later a maintenance man came by, and it took him about 15 minutes to fix it. So a total of 45 minutes before I could use the rest room after arriving. I had suggested to Guest Services on the second call that they move me to a new room and it was awkwardly laughed off. \n\n3. After using the restroom (finally!) I noticed the tub was dirty and there was mold on the top of the shower by the rod and on top and inside the mini-fridge. The mold was "new" so it could have easily been wiped off and taken care of if the room was being properly clean and attention to detail was paid. The fact that the hotel lacked the ability for such simple house keeping was surprising. \n\n4. The paint in various places of the room was chipping and some of the furniture, most notably the side table were knicked and scratched badly. \n\n5. Because of the bed bug reviews, I stripped the sheets to look for evidence. I did not find any, but did become aware of many brown and black tar stains on the sheets that were tucked in to the mattress. \n\n6. I begrudgingly ordered room service because of how late it was by the time I got settled. I ordered the Turkey BLT with lemon aioli and arugula salad. Instead I got cold, what-seemed-like-day-old deli meat, burnt bacon with a thin, thin layer of mayo, not aioli. The arugula salad did not have 1 piece of arugula - it was mixed greens with shredded carrots instead. When you read the description and look at what I actually received, it is very, very disappointing. \n\n7. The coffee pot in my room leaked all off, wetting the sugar, napkins, etc. \n\n8. They charged the wrong credit card after both myself and my office manager telling several different people which card to charge. I had booked the room on a corporate card, and my office manager had believed she straightened everything out at the front desk that they were to charge the card on file because I would not have the corporate card with me. The first thing I was asked by the front desk was for a credit card. After I explained the situation to the front desk, they insisted that the card on file would be charged and they just needed my card for "incidentals" - after back and fourth I gave in and gave them my card, assured it would not be charged. Then when I checked out two days later, I once again confirmed that they would charge the card on file and they still charged the wrong one.  Fast forward to the following week when I notice the charges, I called the billing department and someone has still yet to return my call. I am being charged interest on this card for their mistake. \n\nThis was an absolute terrible experience and I am very disappointed at the Westin and Starwood Hotels for their obvious lack of pride and detail with this hotel.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	comfortable bed, good water pressure, good view, great location - walking distance to several attractions
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Still a great hotel but be warned: if you do NOT want maid service knocking on the door at 8 am to see when you are checking out, put the do not disturb sign on the door. Only made that mistake once...
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	The employees here are nice, hotel room is clean - I like when the towels smell fresh/bleached.  Shower stayed hot.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I previously rated this hotel as 1 star (I had some legit reasons based on customer service experience). However, hotel management contacted me off line and seemed genuinely apologetic and worked to make things right. While my initial experience may not have lived up to the Westin name, the follow up certainly did. This leads me to believe the issue I encountered is not systemic -- merely one of those situations were someone might be having a bad night. Consequently, I've raised my review to 3 stars and will give them another try in the future.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Really not up to the Westin standards (although I'm finding more and more of them are sub par). The rooms are shabby (hey Starwood - putting in. A rain shower head is not an upgrade) only two outlets, visible dust on the towel racks, shower was either scalding hot or freezing cold, front desk people were dismissive. If you have other options, I would investigate them and go here as a last resort. I did not see any vermin during my stay.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Facilities are very nice, beds are a little small for a couple.  At six am on 3/21/14 the neighboring room's alarm (1106) went off and cut right through the wall waking everyone up. I called the front desk at six thirty asking them to send someone to stop it, she said they would have to "involve security". 8am now and it is still going full blast uninterrupted. Great start to a vacation courtesy of Weston.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	When your stay at a Westin just doesn't feel like a Westin, life is just a little more sad. First world problems, I know. \n\nI've stayed at this hotel for a couple nights on two separate business trips. I'll start by sharing that I have had a positive experience with the staff, the phone service center, maintenance person who fixed my fridge and the staffer who quickly came up to give me new card keys after I asked to be moved to another room due to noise. Another positive is their large fitness center. The equipment is a little run down but there are plenty of cardio, weight and free weights available. They also have a fitness studio where I believe they have cycling and/or yoga classes evident by the number of mats and bikes in the room. \n\nSo why the two stars? First the rooms and the bathrooms were outdated and dirty. The bathroom and tubs had visible grout and the chairs in the room were stained. Second, I don't expect good pillows at hotels but the pillows at this Westin had very little to no support which made it difficult to sleep. If you like pillows that aren't firm, you'll love them. Noise was also an issue with the rooms. When your neighbor was taking a shower or using the restroom you heard it, it was loud. If you are a light sleeper do not face the convention center because it overlooks a number of generators and the noise from those machines carry into the rooms. \n\nThe last best Westin property I stayed at was the one in Downtown Austin. Sigh, now that was a Westin. :)
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I love the location of this hotel.  While I didn't stay at this hotel while there were any conventions the location of this place is great because it's walking distance to some places on Penn and not too far from the strip district.  \n\nAs far as parking goes you can park at the bus station right across the street and parking overnight is a steal compared to parking off Ft. Duquesne the last time we stayed at the Wyndham (formally Hilton) by the triangle.  \n\nWhile there is a fish restaurant in the Westin it didn't get very good reviews so I avoided it.  Being so close to the strip district you could walk if you wanted to at least to the western portions of it.  \n\nAs all Starwood chains this hotel has big comfortable beds.  Also every Westin I have been to has a bit of a modern feel to it.  The room decor is never outdated and the property is well kept.  As expected the room was very clean and it smelled very fresh as well.\n\nFor downtown Pittsburgh I like this location and this hotel over some of the others I've stayed at in downtown because of the location and the convenient and affordable parking as well as the comfortable rooms and bed.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I wish we had gotten there earlier as we had a very late check in and wife and I were only staying one night.\nThe hotel is beautiful and the room was big and fantastic.\nWe were on the 19th floor and had an amazing view of Pittsburgh.\nThe staff were extremely friendly and very helpful.\nI would definitely stay at the Westin again if in the area
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	The service was good. Tony the shuttle driver was very helpful as were all the women at the front desk. I became ill while I stayed there and they sent me up complimentary room service which was a nice gesture on their part. \n\nMy only gripe comes from two bills at the restaurants I ate at. I had their brunch twice during my stay and then had all sorts of complications with using my debit card. There were charges that were just incorrect on the bill which took me a couple of days and couple of phonecalls to different departments within the hotel to clear up. That was really inconvenient and a hard way to leave after having a pretty nice stay other than being sick. The staff were all friendly and helpful and the I enjoyed the layout of the room and the double headed shower. \nI took them up on the 'Go Green option" and took about 1500 starpoints with me because of this!
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Recently I took a budget trip to Pittsburgh. How much of a budget trip? Well, lets put it this way, the only reason I went is because I was able to snag a set of free Megabus tickets. Wanting to keep the trip as cheap as possible, and stay centrally located to downtown, I decided to use Hotwire, and ended up staying at the Westin Convention Center. \n\nAlthough the hotel had glowing reviews on Hotwire, Yelpers overall seemed to feel differently, which caused me to worry. However, after arriving and seeing the room I was instantly relieved and happy with my decision. The room was clean, the beds were comfortable, and the view was an excellent 25th floor view of the Strip District below. On top of this, the staff were all very kind and courteous, and were more than willing to call cabs for us as well. \n\nMy biggest complaints about the Westin really all surround the bathroom. Although very clean, I was annoyed with the fact that the shower made this crazy noise whenever it was on which sounded like somebody gargling at sonic boom levels. In addition, there seemed to be no fan, which meant if you got a hot shower, you couldn't see anything in the mirror without wiping it off. Lastly, there was no lock! I mean, yeah, we managed without, but it is still reassuring to know that a lock stands between your privacy and three of your friends.\n\nOverall however, I was extremely pleased with my visit and would gladly return to the Westin again if I ever find myself in Pittsburgh.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Everything was perfect about my stay here. The moment you step out of your vehicle you are greeted by friendly and helpful staff. The room was super clean and nicely decorated, spectacular river view over looking the Pittsburgh skyline, Heinz Field and PNC Park. Best part..The room was very quiet, ultra deluxe beds that was heavenly and the complimentary hot chocolate and marshmallows that was waiting in our room after a chilly evening stroll where all nice touches. Can't beat the location, we where within walking distance of many great restaurants, bars, shopping and public transportation. Amazing hotel! Super sweet staff. Will definitely stay here again the next time we are in Pittsburgh.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	This hotel was very nice. It was very clean and the location was great, being in the heart of the city. With that said the only things I didn't like were the thin walls in the room. Whoever was in the room next to me had their phone on vibrate and I kept thinking it was mine, like I shouldn't of been able to hear that. Another thing I didn't like was the fact we had no fridge or microwave. We went to restaurants and we couldn't bring any leftovers back because there wasn't one single microwave in the hotel. For the most part I enjoyed staying at the westin, shower and bed are both very relaxing.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Not a bad choice for a downtown hotel and it's attached to the convention center by a skywalk. Rooms are pretty standard and I did get a good night sleep every night during my 3 night stay. I would recommend staying here for that sole reason, although I would like to add a few things that I found interesting or bugged me a little.\n\n1. The bathrooms don't have ventilation fans.\n2. Tv was a tube... Huh?\n3. No free coffee or water in the lobby.\n4. The burger bar in the lobby was the worst burger I ever had in my life... You been warned\n5. The revolving door spins extremely slow.\n6. Hotel store is very expensive and not run by Westin. \n\nPositives to be fair...\n\n1. It's located close to very cool bars\n2. The lobby has an interesting element to it.\n3. Shower was awesome \n4. Bed was comfortable \n5. Elevator keypad is really cool\n6. Great gym\n\nI would probably stay again if I could get a lower rate... $125-$150 a night is about right... Although the Marriott hotel down the block peaked my interest for my next visit.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I was expecting a high quality hotel from the Westin brand. What I found was a room that smelled of B.O., an outdated bathroom and an annoying emphasis on recycling and environmentalism.  If this was a rating of 1 to 5 on a scale of just Westin hotels it would probably be a 1 no problem. But even a bad Westin is better than a Super8. \n\nThe lobby looks nice and inviting and the staff were all helpful. Parking wasn't too hard and the price wasn't shocking. \n\nThe B.O. smell hit me as soon as we walked into the room. There were placards and signs everywhere saying how much Westin was trying to save the world by turning off your lights when you leave the room and not washing your sheets. I get it...if you dont change the sheets you save on water, detergent, labor, $, $, $, $$$$$......\n\nI'm not an idiot. I know all this 'environmental' garbage is a bunch of moneymaking ideas dreamt up by some suits. Some are laudable like requiring a keycard to turn the lights on, but get real...they're offering people $5 off their next visit if they don't have their bed remade between nights. This is a hotel....why not suggest saving me $5 if you padlock the bathroom door? About as logical. Hotels = Bed with fresh sheets every night.  By the way, they obviously discontinued the minibar fridge because the power goes out when you leave the room. So why not take the fridges out of the room? Very amateurish to leave them sitting in rooms.\n\nThe hot tub/pool facilities are the kind where you have to sign in, show your key, and walk all the way through the locker rooms before you can enter the pool area that looks like it's a Mexican hotel in the 80's. Not the greatest. I don't care to look at old man ass on my way to the hot tub.\n\nThe location is good for catching a game downtown or for a night on the town. But for business or a romantic trip, there are better quality hotels around I'm sure.\n\nOh, and the beds were extremely comfortable.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I stayed at this hotel while attending a convention in Pittsburgh. This is probably the best choice for accommodations if you have to go to the convention center a lot since there is an air-conditioned pedestrian bridge link between the hotel and convention center.\n\nI thought the room and beds were comfortable. I wasn't so fond of the cutesy leaf-shaped soap in the bathroom. I didn't like that you have to put your keycard in a slot in the wall to turn on the power in the room. Sure, it saves some electricity (and saves the hotel some money too, I'll bet), but that means you come back to a hot room every time. We ended up leaving a piece of cardboard in the slot.\n\nParking is expensive. The hotel used to offer discount cards to bring the garage parking rate down to $10/day but they stopped doing that this year because of a change in parking garage management. So it's $20/day. Ouch! I parked at the Grant Street Transportation Center for $13/day weekdays and $5/day weekend. It's not bad but still less convenient than if I could park in the parking garage immediately under the hotel.\n\nElevators are slow and the escalators between the lobby and function room floors kept breaking down. However, I'd cut them some slack here because the infrastructure is not built for 4000+ people hanging around the hotel.\n\nAll those problems aside, I thought service was good and this hotel has a good location with walking access to lots of restaurants.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	The Westin is a great place to stay.  The beds are comfy.  The pillows fluffy. The shower had great water pressure.  \n\nThey have a system where your key card powers the lights and AC which is pretty cool.  It took me a second to get used to that system.  I wonder how much energy the key card actually saves.  \n\nLoved that this hotel is walking distance to the cultural district, strip district and PNC Park.  \n\nMy only complaints were that the bathroom smelled a bit like old urine and the iron not working.  It wasn't a huge deal and I didn't complain.  Otherwise, 4 stars!
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I've always loved this hotel. Lovely location right by the river, near enough to the sports venues for a pretty easy walk over the bridges.\n\nCheck in was pleasant as I've always experienced here, staff were all very friendly and helpful.\n\nRooms were clean but could use a bit of updating; finding a convenient outlet to charge my phone was a bit of a challenge. \n\nOne odd note, you must use your room key in order to turn the lights on in the room. There is a slot for that purpose just as you enter so, take my advice and get at least 2 room keys.\n\nThe restaurant attached to the hotel, a lovely, fine dining establishment called the Old Fishmarket, is slated to close at the end of October, 2014...in it's place is going to be a restaurant called "Bill's Burgers & Grill" I hear it is good, but we shall see next time I stay here.\n\nThere is the option of self-parking or valet parking on site at the hotel.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Stayed here over New Years Eve (16/17) and had a terrible check in experience.  We arrived at 3:00 on NYE and knew that it would probably be a long shot to get checked in on time.  However, we didn't realize that we would be unable to check in until around 8:00 and by then we already were forced to leave all of our belongings with concierge and carry on with our night plans.  If we would have waited at the hotel we would have missed dinner and the show we were there to see.  This was frustrating because we weren't able to change our clothes and could only check in until about 1:00am.  Just disappointing but in all fairness the late night staff explained that there were a number of housekeeping call offs which is outside of anyone's control.  Maybe an incentive for the housekeeping staff to work NYE would have eliminated a few call offs.   Finally, we paid for a king room but we were given a double room...honestly by the time we checked in we really just wanted to hit the hay but if we both were larger folks a double bed would have been unacceptable.  Just a very choppy experience and more than likely will roll the dice somewhere else when visiting Pittsburgh.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	The Westin  convention Center is located downtown of Pittsburgh. I reserved a city sky view room on the 18th Floor with twin beds. I got a perfect beautiful view of the city from my windows. The room was clean with a large LCD TV, but the sink is inside the bathroom. If someone inside the bathroom, I can't brush or wash my face. I hardly got any sleep at night from the loud clinking plumbing sound from the next door usage of the bathroom. addional indoor Parking cost $19
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Great hotel. Close to many attractions and well maintained. Parking is a little poor though. The only reason for the 3 stars is that the Internet is abysmal at best. I thought a convention center would have half decent Internet, I was wrong.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Stay on 6/12/15\nFriendly front desk staff. When we arrived to our room the bathroom was dirty and there was hair all over the place (shower & floor). We went downstairs and asked for a new room. The front desk staff was apologetic about the situation and gave us a new room. Nice room with a great view of the city and PNC Park. Nice gym and okay pool. We really enjoyed the location. Walking distance to so many things! Would stay again
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	We are packing now, were here for an academic conference on new guidelines being implemented throughout the states.\nThe beds at the Westin are very comfy, as are the pillows.\nI thought it was a nice stay.\n\n***Wifi is $15.95 a day**** This is highly annoying.  This is not per room it is per computer. My husband paid the fee and the network only connected his computer. When he is away at the conference, I have no access to wifi.\nThe television seems to also go black several times during programs.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I stood at this hotel during a short business trip. It was ok. It wasn't super special. I only spent two nights here so I did t get to explore the hotel like I usually do. It is in the financial district of Pittsburgh. It sits about a 20 minute drive from south side Pittsburgh which is where we found a bunch of bars and restaurants. \n\nThis hotel was decent. It was pretty comfortable but they did not have free wifi which is an absolute bummer. I look forward to wifi so that I'm able to get work done, send emails, etc. during my stay. I didn't get to interact with the staff too much since I was really in and out.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I stayed here this past weekend for a conference.  I shared a room with a few friends at the conference rate, so I can't really comment on the normal price of the room.  The room was clean, though beware that the tile in the bathroom makes it look likely someone didn't sweep up hair.\n\nThe room had the basic amenities (ironing board, T.V., etc.).  We didn't hear any exterior noises or noises from the hall in the room, which was great.  The beds were very comfortable (although the comforter, like in most Westins, is very warm, so opt for lighter pjs). \n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  I also really liked the convenience of having a deli, pizza place, restaurant, and coffee shop accessible from the lobby of the hotel.  However, this Westin seemed to lack some of the amenities of other Westin hotels, such as bathrobes and free coffee in the lobby.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	The hotel is centrally located which made it a nice walk back from the Steelers game. It was clean and the staff was friendly. The beds weren't super comfortable. I expected the hotel to be a little nicer than it was. I think the false fire alarm at 6am was unpleasant considering I never heard why it went off in the first place. If you are a deep sleeper than forget hearing the alarm. All in all in was a decent hotel but not one I plan on staying at again.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	This hotel is sub par. Upon check in the staff is not that friendly. You get up to your room and its not that clean. While the beds are made the surfaces are dusty and looks like nobody has vacuumed in a while. I was here for a work conference and stayed here for "comfort"  I was not impressed. There are no plugs by the bed which makes it difficult to charge your phone and computer. You have to move the heavy side table and located behind are plugs all of which are covered in 17 layers of dust. Also you have to unplug either the lamp, phone, or alarm clock if you'd like to use a plug. \n\nTwo of the three lamps in my room did not work either because the bulb was out or lamp was unplugged and I couldn't access the plug. Also had a fridge in my room which barely got cold. \n\nMy towels had stains on them.  Also they have this program where you can place a sign on your door and housekeeping won't clean your room or change your sheets during your stay to conserve energy and resources. I get the program. I however did not participate. Nevertheless housekeeping did not provide new sheets or make the bed neatly. There were lumps and the sheets were not properly tucked in. Next time I visit I'll try the Marriotts across the street \n\nIf you use a debit card to pay they charge you the rate of the room for your entire stay plus 40% for incidental!!!! You get reimbursed after 10 days. If you pay with a credit card then no additional charge! This is absurd!!!! No other hotel I've stayed at charges you this much for incidental!  Plus debit cards are cash and 40% is unreasonable. \n\nOn the day of my check out I left to attend the morning session of my conference and came back up around 10 in the morning to relax before the noon checkout to find that housekeeping had already stripped my room!!!  Guests have until noon!!!! Also they have this ridiculous policy of a noon check out our else $15 charge. They are strict on that and won't give you a courtesy extension. Yet the strip your room two hours early!  This also happened to my colleague the day prior. With my company giving them so much business (about 350 plus people attending) you'd think they would have better customer service. \n\nNot happy and a total inconvenience while traveling. Would not recommend this hotel. I've stayed at Howard Johnson's of better caliber.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	The hotel is overall lovely. We especially liked the lobby area and the bar/restaurant on the main floor.  We had dinner our first night at the Bar and it was really good.  Our waiter was awesome, friendly and VERY attentive. Our food was good and the drinks were too!  We had the breakfast buffet on the second level the next morning.  It was ok. More of a variety would have been preferred, but it did the trick :-)\n\nTwo things that need improvement.  We booked two rooms for the weekend. We were assigned rooms 2413 and 2416.  2413 was perfect. Very clean and great view!  My nephews stayed in 2413 and loved everything about it.\n\nThe room I stayed in, 2416 was not so perfect.  Immediately upon entering the room we noticed a very strong unpleasant odor.  Dare I say it really smelled like old BO.  Couldn't pin-point where it was coming from, but we did notice the lamp on the desk area was stained with...not sure (maybe a water stain?) and thought it might have been from that, but it was not.  There is an upholstered chair it may have come from, but again we just couldn't pin it down.  We went to buy a bottle of Fabreeze and sprayed all the surfaces so that helped.  The room also never really cooled down. This was an extremely hot and humid weekend, so we just thought that was probably the issue.  Anyway, that odor continued to haunt us throughout the stay.  I had a very difficult time sleeping that first night because I couldn't get past the odor.  The beds were EXTREMELY comfortable and I may consider purchasing something similar for my home.\n\nThe other thing I would like to mention was the shuttle service the Westin provides to locations surrounding the hotel.  I have to say, this was one of the major factors we used in deciding where to stay in Pittsburgh.  We came to Pittsburgh to visit PNC Park and catch a few ball games.  Having the shuttle take us there and pick us up was a huge bonus.  The ride to the park Saturday evening was good.  The shuttle was full, but people and the driver were very pleasant for the short trip to the ballpark.  We were told by the shuttle driver to call him when we were ready to be picked up.  He gave us his cell number and told us exactly where to wait for him.  We did as instructed and called him BEFORE the game was over as we headed to the corner for our trip back to the hotel.  He told us he would be there in 15 minutes and to make sure we were at the corner (in front of the Soho restaurant). We waited patiently... Understandably traffic was high so we knew it might be a longer wait and we were fine with that.  Down the block we noticed a shuttle just pulling in front of the Holiday Inn.  My nephew ran to the end of the block to check to see if that was the Westin's shuttle and it was.  Now several other people started to run to the shuttle (who were also on our shuttle to the park earlier) and they boarded as well as 4 "other" folks who happened to be walking at that end of the street and decided "hey, let's hop on and get off over that way", my nephew heard the group say.  He believed they were NOT guests at your resort.   Whatever, the point here is, we did exactly as instructed and were left stranded by that employee.  I WAS FURIOUS.  We ordered an Uber and got back to the hotel after midnight.  This in my opinion was unacceptable.  \n\nNot sure if we will ever return to Pittsburgh.  We visit and are staying at the Westin in Cincinnati in a few weeks, and this experience is making me double guess that decision.\n\nWish I could have said more nice things about our stay.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Unbelievable!!!!!!  On 11th floor, people have waited over an hour for elevator.  This hotel is not equipped to handle crowds
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Location is ok for the downtown area. Not too impressed though, and won't be in my top 3 choices for the future. \n\nHere's my list: \nPro's: \nLocation \nSelf-Park at the Greyhound Bus garage a block down the street (anywhere from $5-$13/day depending on weekday or weekend) \nWalkable to all sporting venues \nGreat restaurant across the street NOT associated with the hotel (Tonic) \nFantastic gym and indoor pool \n\nCon's: \nRack rate='spensive \nSelf park at hotel is $20/day, ouch, w/ no in and out \nRoom had a stink that didn't go away \nMaids like to knock to clean the rooms starting at 8 AM, and do so multiple times if you don't put the privacy sign out \nHotel staff not particularly nice as what you'd expect out of a Westin \nThe Fish Market (restaurant in the hotel) super 'spensive w/o great snack offerings, and again, not so nice service \nWalls are super thin- so much so that we had morning wakeup calls from our "neighbor" hitting the head, gross \nBeing colocated with the convention center means lots of traffic around the hotel and lots of obnoxious people \n~~~~~ \nIs now when I mention that we got the place for $70/night on Priceline (4 star, you'll either get this or the Omni)? If you can deal with the above, then this is your place...if not, pay the rack rate somewhere else.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Had to have my sheets changed when I got to my room. Stains on some towels. Worst elevator system I've ever come across. Should tell you all you need to know.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	This is my 2nd stay here and since I had to unload my car at the valet and bring my own 5 suitcases to my room on a valet car I am already disappointed in the service. I actually had to get on the elevator with my own luggage with other people with this big cart. Disappointed that the Fairmont had no vacancies. Ditch this hotel.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	2.75 stars. Mostly for The extremely Friendly staff  AND The GREAT view From OUR Room On The 24th Floor. The sheets seemed cleaned (and I didn't see any bed bugs) but that was about the only clean thing. The light switches, crevices,  phone, corners of shower/tub were horrendously filthy. As other pictures have depicted, they are doing a terrible job cleaning. But maybe they're not even trying! Maybe changing sheets is the extent of their effort. Parking is overpriced for a city like Pittsburgh and a 2 hour limit,  for 4$ each hour, is ridiculous in my opinion. Again this is Pittsburgh NOT Philly, DC, or NY. Breakfast options in the immediate area are almost nonexistent.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	The Westin was not up to the Westin quality.  The room was dirty.  The toilet had pooh in the bowl.  The bathtub had hair and grime on the side. The shower had lots of hair.  It was just disgusting.  I definitely do NOT recommend.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Modern, convenient and comfortable.  My one quibble was that the room I checked into had every light in it burning upon my arrival.  The thermostat was set at 60F - freezing!  The duvet was so heavy that you couldn't use it as a blanket.  This is supposed to be an energy efficient hotel?  My check in clerk didn't even bother to explain the food credit for waiving room service.  I overheard it.  Otherwise a pleasant (if pricey) stay.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Conveniently located next to the Convention and Conference Center in the heart of downtown. Great furnishing and modern up-to-date amenities one would expect at a Westin property. Big full head rainfall shower and comfy pillow and mattresses to relax after a long day
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I requested an early check in two months ago when I booked my room, yesterday I called and they confirmed. When I checked in this morning no room and currently still waiting. \n\nI explained that I'm very sick, I'm currently feeling the effects of a terminal disease and that was why I requested the early booking.\n\nBut yet, here I wait in the lobby trying not to barf. \n\nI doubt I'll ever stay here again, nor would I recommend staying here.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I really enjoyed my stay here. It's a pretty pricey hotel but we got our room off of hotwire. The location was very convenient and the hotel is very pretty inside. I thought the rooms were very spacious and comfy.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	We travel to away Saints games and stayed here for the weekend.  The hotel was very nice all around.  Efficient , friendly staff and genuinely hospitable.  The rooms were in good condition and well-maintained.  \n\nSo were looking forward to returning for a woodworking symposium at the Lawrence Convention Center.\n\nI'd say lots was the same but some of the changes were irritating and so to be fair, the negatives first (ending on a high note).\n\nFor the game, a room. For this time, we had a King suite.  19th floor.  View okay but not great as advertised but hey, you're not there to sit in the hotel all day, right? :-)\n\nWell I had booked a corner suite but there was a bit of an issue with my profile on SPG and so they were "de-feathering" the room and it was taking forever. So I said, another corner suite was fine.  Except it wasn't.  It was a suite alright, but in the living area where one would expect a sofa, sitting area and TV, etc?  There sat a 4 top dining table with a hole in the middle. Turns out that lots of business travelers like this arrangement for meetings and all the suites below the 11th floor have this.  \n\nSO LOOK OUT before you book, people!  :-)\n\nBut seriously it wasn't a huge deal as they were more than happy to move me. And they did - to a complimentary upgrade King Suite that you could a tech startup in.  Very spacious, with dual closets, very nice sitting area with couch and two comfy chairs, two huge picture windows about the size of patio sliders.  A vanity area outside the (smallish) bathroom.\n\nAbout that bathroom. A couple things bug me when I travel.  One, is that some downtown hotels don't have a fan/vent in the bathroom, and so the mirror fogs up big time.  Not a huge deal and I use the hair dryer so I can see, but really? can't they do something?\n\nThe other thing is this:  I hate rain shower heads. I'm an old dude, I like my water pressure, not a rain forest gently wafting over me. I want velocity!  Hit me with that H20!  And yes, I know that we need to conserve water, but I have a seriously great low flow shower head at home and it cost 20 bucks on Amazon.  Sheesh!\n\nAnother gripe:  There were exactly two places to recharge a device in the entire suite, and both were at a side table about 12 feet from the bed (and only halfway across the room)!\n\nNow, between us we have 5 devices to charge including phones. I use mine for my alarm and like it right there.  So really, can't we have a retrofit so grown folk can charge their whatsits?\n\n\nFinally, the elevators. What?  How can that be an issue? Well, since our last visit, they installed a software/hardware package that eliminates the buttons inside the elevator. Instead, there is a touch screen at each floor.  One selects the destination, and the screen lights up with a large number telling you which elevator. \n\nWhich SUCKS.  I'm sure they're using some kind of load-management software to optimize elevator use, and I'm sure that the goal is more efficient utilization and less latency.  Well it ain't makin' it.  You wait and wait and wait.  Then sometimes - if you're like me - you forget which elevator you were supposed to take.\n\nI did find that, it seems that if you go press all the screens with your floor and perhaps those above, the software sensed increased demand and sent an elevator quicker.  Hacking an elevator. Who'd a thought it?\n\nNow to the good:\n\nThe staff were super friendly, warm and helpful.  So when I asked, they found a power strip and a 25' orange extension cord and I ran it over to the bed along the wall.  Sort of the Clampetts come to city with my cord running all over the room. Nonetheless, we had power to our devices.\n\nThe room was otherwise nice and quiet.  Did I mention that it was large? \n\nThe hotel restaurants are good. Penn Grille is more relaxed overall and Bill's is more of a "joint" but the burgers are great, as are the nachos.  The service in both is excellent and the staff are unfailingly friendly - really hospitable the way we mean it here in the south.\n\nThe hotel is attached to the Lawrence Convention Center, which was nice as it rained some each day. We made it to the various events high and dry.\n\nI would say that the high point of the hotel is without question the attentiveness, courtesy and genuine friendliness of the hotel staff.  Not that fake, I'm polite but really looking down on you courtesy that we've experienced at the Ritz in Chicago (which I reviewed last year).\n\nIn fact, if this hotel was sited next to the Ritz, and the price was the same, I'd choose the Westin, hands down. And given that the rooms were less than half that of the Ritz, that's a good indicator of how well we were treated. \n\nMy wife tipped the housekeeping lady $300 because she was so nice. What else can I tell you?  Stay there.\n\nAnd Pittsburgh, you are an awesome town. Good people, beautiful views, and a good nightlife too.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Great location, central to many Pittsburgh locations. I must say though, I'm glad that I've always stayed here on someone else's dime. It's not cheap. The parking is pretty pricey, around $20 a day. If you're looking to save a few bucks I believe you can park around the corner at the Greyhound Bus Terminal for about $14 a day (?).\n\nBeds are super cozy. I'm a huge fan of their toiletry line - white tea aloe! Also a big fan of the fact that their in-room coffee is starbucks (see photo!). Thank god. The front desk staff seem very helpful, but I have not really had many interactions aside from the check in & out processes. \n\nConnected to the convention center if you're traveling for an event there - can be convenient in the winter months since there's no need to walk outside. \n\nThe gym seems amazing. They now have a program where they'll even lend you workout clothing (there may be a small fee?) and shoes! If you're traveling by plan and have limited packing space this could be a life saver!\n\nOne thing that really burns me is the internet. It's "free" but when you log in, you'll see there are actually 4 or 5 different options. I have a feeling that if you're not paying you're getting lower bandwidth. Annoying. Would do 3.5 stars if I could.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	My husband and I recently called the Westin home for four nights while we were in town for a wedding.  We booked the hotel at a great rate on Hotwire.  Knowing fully well what we were getting ourselves into by perusing their website (what's in the neighborhood, price of parking, restaurants in the hotel, amenities, etc.), we were a little bit afraid that since the hotel was next to the convention center, that perhaps the hotel stay would feel too "corporate."\n\nBut, this was not the case at all.  We felt so at home in this room.  We were on a high level floor (Starwood Preferred), and our large hotel window overlooked the rivers and the ballparks.  We even got to see fireworks the night we arrived!  I had called ahead to let the hotel know that my husband and I also were coincidentally celebrating our anniversary that weekend, so we were welcomed by a complimentary bottle of champagne and a plate of chocolate covered strawberries.  SOOO delicious, and SO good after a long day of flying across country.\n\nThe hotel charges $24/night for valet, which was worth it.  Self-parking is only a few dollars cheaper every night, but it really saved the long haul of luggage and having to walk with tired feet coming home late every night.  And the valet crew was outstanding.\n\nAnother perk is that there are two restaurants in the hotel.  One of them closes late every night, so there was no lack of food or drink any minute of our stay.  The additional bonus is that Downtown Pittsburgh is pretty hopping and busy, and being so close to many great restaurants and theaters, there is no shortage to all the fun and interesting things within walking distance of the Westin.\n\nAnd, to me, the best thing of all of the bed!  It was one of the best beds I have EVER slept in, and I unusually was able to get right to sleep once in bed, and I stayed asleep.  Oh, man, I'm still dreaming about it!\n\nIn the end, loved the hotel.  Would stay in again if the rate was right.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	This is a very good hotel and with a corporate rate of $107 per night it is the best bargain in town.  I stay in hotels in the city often rather than drive home after a night  of partying and I used to stay at the Holiday Inn Express S. Side for the location.  The holiday inn cost is $140 per night and the hotel is fine for a place to crash for a few hours, but  the Westin is actually a place that I look forward to visiting.  The rooms are pretty big.  Request the higher floors because the view is awesome.  I stayed on the 25th floor last night and had a great view of the arena and train station.  The beds are great.  They also have a fridge for you  to put your own drinks.  However, I think they  should have a minibar.  Mario the doorman also is pretty helpful.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	The Westin was everything you can expect in a downtown hotel.  Great view, high quality finishes and fixtures in the room, world class workout room, outstanding lobby and great staff. \n\nWe came into town with a Steeler game on Sunday and a Pirates home stand over the weekend. Needless to say this place and everything else going on downtown was very busy that weekend. \n\nThe Westin was the perfect place. 8 blocks from the stadium and 8 blocks from the famous Strip District. Couldn't be a more perfect location for a family weekend in Pittsburgh. \n\nOnly gripe was the elevators. On numerous occasions it stopped on 3-5 floors on the way up and down for passengers that weren't there.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I do not understand the new obsession with hotels' being "green."  We were offered the chance to decline housekeeping (is this just to give them an excuse to fire some of their employees?) and to turn off one of the two awesome showerheads (what an awful idea), and were forced to insert our keycard into the light switch in order to turn on some of the lights.  \n\nNone of it was that big of an inconvenience, but it all seemed bizarre to me.  And unlikely to be that significant relative to bigger decisions like using energy-efficient machines to wash the sheets, having quality insulation to save on heating and cooling, and so on.  Maybe the Westin does these things too, I don't know, but it seemed like the little annoyances in the room were more of a marketing gimmick than a substantive step.  (And like a previous reviewer, we noticed a faint smell of sweat and human body odor in our room.)\n\nBeyond that, it's fine--parking isn't cheap, the wireless is unreliable and slow, and in-hotel food options are dubious--but it's squarely in the middle ranks of what I have come to expect from downtown hotels in secondary American cities.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I was sooooo disappointed with this hotel. I'm not sure what they use to wash their sheets and towels but the sheets were so dry and harsh I could barely sleep. We asked the front desk about it. They offered to replace our sheets with "brand new ones" you can't even tell the difference. \nThe AC barely works. Our room was stuffy and hit the entire time. \n\nBottom line: it was way too uncomfortable for costing as much as it did. I'll never stay here again.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I stayed at the hotel for several months during the late fall/winter of 2006.  I love this hotels decor - minimal and clean lines which I prefer over the fussiness of the William Penn.  The heavenly beds and showers are really just that.  The shower is 1000xs better than my own apts so it was hard to get out each morning.  They are dog friendly, very dog friendly.  Bringing my dog a bed, treats and bowls.  Wish I had known that in advance as I had already hit Petco.  The doorman greeted my dog everyday with "watch out her comes killer"  yeah lame but I love when my dog gets attention.  He also pet him so I will let it slide.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I am a fan of this hotel.  I've stayed here many times while visiting Pittsburgh and family for holidays and non-holidays.  The rooms are big and and usually very clean (never any weird smells like some have repored).  I like that they are green and that you need to put your key in a slot to keep the lights on/turn off lights automatically when you leave.  The staff are always really nice and have even upgraded me in the past.  I usually get my room via Priceline and they are generally the best deal in town for a nice place to stay with a view.  (I think the availability of this hotel on Priceline and Hotwire has nothing to do with the quality of the hotel, just quantity.  This is a convention hotel and when there isn't a convention going on, it really seems empty...especially on a holiday.  During those times it is almost as if you have the place to yourself.)  \n\nQuick tip: Park in the huge garage/bus terminal 1-block behind the hotel.  Much cheaper than valet parking and inexpensive for downtown parking.\n\nQuick tip 2: A modest tip goes a long way for better housekeeping service.  If you want some extra coffee/tea, extra shampoo, extra towels, etc...leave a tip.  I even got a nice "thank you" on the notepad. \n\nQuick tip 3: Try the bar called "Tonic" across the street.  Good drinks/appetizers.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Stayed overnight and was pleasantly surprised.  Very clean and staff was friendly.  Rooms were large and the bed was extremely comfortable.  Only knock is the underground self parking lot is very poorly marked and difficult to spot until you have committed to pulling into the valet parking.  I drove in circles until I gave up and pulled into valet, and then I saw it.  Also, the rate in this lot is the same regardless if you are staying at the hotel.  $22 for 12-24 hours.  Other than that, nice place.  I would stay there again.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	What a waste of money. I traveled home for a wedding and went out of my way for a luxury experience and booked a night at this Westin and I was very disappointed. This had already been the trip from hell, so I was too exhausted to complain when I checked out. I just wanted out of there. First off, at over $200/night, can you not offer shower gel and/or face wash? I didn't pack toiletries, falsely relying on these items being provided in my room. Wrong. Next, the bed was so uncomfortable. Were those springs I felt in the mattress? Really? It was bumpy! And the sheets... They felt like cardboard. When I pulled the fitted sheet off the mattress to investigate what was so uncomfortable I found hairs matted to the mattress cover. Grrrross! I'm done with the Westin brand and someone seriously needs to contact me about getting my money back. Never again. Heavenly bed? Quite the opposite.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I usually look for the westin whenever im traveling.  On my recent trip to Pittsburgh I booked this one specifially because of the close proximity it had to PnC park since I was catching a game.  Yeah its in downtown and its a huge hotel but this downtown is not really the hangout spot in pittsburgh.  Theres a couple of restaurants and I counted like three lounges after walking round a bit but none that caught my attention.  Teh hotel itself is ok not that super clean like the Aloft hotels.  The hallway carpets were stained and my bathroom was clean but outdated.  At least the bed was comfy and free of bedbugs(I check for that as soon as i enter the room a pet peeve of mine).  It's huge so whenever your trying to talk to someone at check in theres always a line.  Next time I will probably look for its sister hotel Aloft because this seems to be the better out one among the sheraton,westin and Aloft.  Oh yeah you have to pay for valet no private lot this runs about 20 bucks a night.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Great room, great view, definatley top notch hotel, although some odd stuff with key cards in the light switches and other strange stuff that seems like a finger juggle for having the guests get more involved with their counting.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	This Westin is conveniently located near the convention center, but the low relative rank amount of stars is deserved.  I am in a hotel once or twice a month.  This Westin is bottom tenth.  The coffee maker is disgusting and smells.  The beds are constantly short-sheeted, mostly with poor effort.  The phones and clocks are gross.  I gave the management a heads up, and it was not fixed.  Bottom line...  They don't care, so don't frustrate yourself and risk the dirt.  On the bright side, a woman on the elevator was insistent something bit her last night, and I seem to have dodged that bullet.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Such amazing service, found our room to be damp from a running shower. Upgraded our room in a timely fashion
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I stayed here for a 2 day conference and was not overly impressed by the hotel. Westin has established a name for itself, but this hotel fell short. The service was wonderful, pool and fitness room above average, and the location was prime, but the hotel rooms are in need of updating and renovations. \nIf I was paying for this trip, I would have been very disappointed.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Yes the beds are comfy and all that... but creature comforts aren't what merit the 5 stars.  A human does.\nHer name is Nasiba.  She's a housekeeper, and she made the room sparkle.  There's no geiger counter that can measure the TLC put into a tautly-tucked bed sheet, but if there were... it'd be spiking in Nasiba's rooms.\nI tracked her down and met her in the hallway, and we had a nice chat.  She's a delight.  She's Turkish, and was a refugee in Russia, but apparently they didn't exactly roll out the red carpet.  She smiles (and melts your heart) when she tells you in her still-being-honed English "but I came to America seven years ago, and America took me in.  I became a citizen three years ago.  I am American now."  Big smile.  Man oh man, in people like her (hard-working and affectionate toward her new home) you see, and revel in the fact, that we are indeed a nation of immigrants.  She took the time to do it right.  And it's moving.  I told her we're very glad she's here.\nPlus, she has a little American flag in her huge cart.  And that made me smile.\nShe gets the Unsung Award of the day.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	It's been about five years since I stayed at the Westin, and what I remember -- other than that the words of Annie Dillard were scrolling on the roof all night -- is that when I asked at the front desk for help finding a souvenir, Monica went to a flabbergasting amount of trouble (on her own personal time!) to hook me up.\n\nSo it's like this. My name is Ben. The name of the Steelers' quarterback (beloved perhaps even more in 2007 than he is today) is also Ben. As a result, there seemed to be a lot of not-quite-trademark-infringement merchandise in the Steel City, and much of it had my name all over it.\n\nBut I couldn't find a "Ben At Work" sign, try as I might. I asked Monica, who was working at the front desk, if she could help me figure out where to buy one. I figured she'd just tell me if she happened to have a few suggestions.\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.\n\nWhen I saw her that evening, Monica had walked up to the Strip District to canvas all the tchotchkie-mongers and tourist traps. She had come up empty-handed. I was astonished that she had gone to such trouble, but I accepted that there were no Ben At Work signs for sale between the Allegheny and the Monongahela.\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.\n\nUndaunted by such silly little things as the complete and total nonexistence of the desired merchandise on store shelves, Monica got creative. She remembered having given a magnetic "Ben At Work" sign to a friend and called that friend up to ask whether she might be able to get it back.  The friend said "Oh, that? I gave it to my mom."\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.\n\nThat's when Monica called up her friend's mom out of the blue and asked if she still had the sign, and whether it had any sentimental value. No, it doesn't, why do you ask? Well, you see, a guest at my hotel asked if I...\n\nNext time I saw Monica, she had (after finishing her shift at the most popular convention hotel in the city) driven across town to the house of a friend's mom to retrieve the precious artifact.\n\nHere's a photo of her handing it to me. http://j.mp/BenAtWork\n\nAnd when I offered to pay her what she had once paid at the store, she wouldn't take a dime.\n\nAnd when I offered to pay her for the gas she'd burned driving across town, she wouldn't take a dime.\n\nI assume, based on the letter I wrote to the hotel's general manager and copied to corporate (back in November 2007), that she has since been promoted far higher than the front desk. But it wouldn't surprise me a bit if I found out that she had declined to be promoted to a position where she couldn't surprise and delight her customers.\n\nSome people, it seems, just like a challenge.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	This is a nice convention center perfect for big events and conferences. Its spread out so if your conference has workshops in just about all of the classrooms like mine did then be prepared to walk! \n\nThe garage is very pricey of course but what garage these days isnt. It can also be quite confusing on which end to park at and which elevator to take. \n\nThe location is ideal! With the Westin Hotel being the connecting hotel. However there are only 2 elevators to get you there which can be a cluster F! Plenty of restaurants within walking distance to the convention center. Kinds of pricey and comparable to our Over-the-Rhine area but not as nice! The view of the river is near is well which a great. \n\nOverall not a bad place to hold an event.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I have been coming to Pittsburgh for quite a while, and knew this location as the Vista before being taken over by the Westin.  This is also the location for all the visiting teams coming into Pittsburgh for the football and baseball games there.  \n\nWhen they took over, they added the "Heavenly beds" (big beds with pillow tops and great duvets) and "heavenly showers" (which have the bowed shower curtain to give you more room).  The trick we learned was to get to the room, turn on the airconditioning, and when you get back get under the duvet.  It is great. \n\nThe staff here is great too.  The doorman will also arrange a limo for your transportation around downtown if you play your cards right. \n\nThe restaurant there (Fish Company) is OK, and the bar is great.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	The Westin gets five stars for being flexible, friendly and accommodating to this working mom. I'm a breastfeeding mother who was on my first business trip away from my child. I arrived at 7:30 in the morning after taking a red-eye and during my stay requested access to a private room before check-in and access to a freezer.\n\nThe Westin staff went above and beyond to help out and even offered to move my luggage into my hotel room once it became available so that I didn't have to leave my convention session. \n\nEveryone I encountered including the cleaning lady on floor 21 and the guy who delivered a refrigerator to my room was prompt, helpful and friendly, even at 4 a.m as I was leaving the hotel.\n\nFor a city-dweller who doesn't mind walking, the Westin was also within 30 minutes stroll to a great weekend farmer's market and the Mattress Factory, a contemporary art museum. We had delicious soul food at Carmi Family Restaurant. Overall I was pleasantly surprised by the convenience of the location to arts, culture and good food.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I've stayed at this Westin a few days a week for about a month. While technically located downtown, it's more on the outskirts of downtown (just based on my observations). It is connected to the convention center but I've never been inside so I can't give an opinion on it.\n\nMy overall experience at the Westin has been positive. There is no 'Wow' factor but the gym is incredibly nice (but close at 10pm). The rooms are standard with all the normal Westin perks, such as a bathrobe, dual shower heads, and heavenly beds. There is an option for free slooooow internet but platinum members get internet for free (yay?). \n\nI hadn't noticed at first but after someone pointed it out, you'll notice there is an odor in the halls and rooms. It isn't very noticeable but its there.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	We stayed at the Westin Convention Center at the end of June 2013.\nThe front desk staff was very friendly.  He helped us out with toiletries (since my bags were lost) and great locations to eat.  He upgraded our room to one near the top floor with an amazing view of PNC Park and Heinz Field.  Since we were staying there for a Brewers-Pirates game, this was a huge bonus!  \nThe hotel had a free shuttle that took us to the baseball game.  \nDon't bother with the pool - it is TINY and you have to sign in and out to use it... very odd.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Elizabeth at the counter was extremely helpful, professional, & attentive. My\nFiance took me me out for a night on the town, she directed me to the bathroom, in which time she asked my fiancé why we were there. He told her we were in the city to treat me to a night before he had to go out of town. She really took to heart why we were here, and gave him a room high up with a beautiful view to make our night complete. She had great salesmanship and service all the way around. Fed a shout out to the door guy, mark, very cool and helpful guy!
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I see a lot of mixed reviews here on Yelp. This Westin Hotel must have renovated recently because I didn't have any bad experiences here. \n\nMy hotel room was beautiful and spacious. The view from the 15th floor was gorgeous too. The bathroom shower was fantastic. It was like showering in a waterfall. I would definitely stay at this Westin again.\n\nI thought the location of this hotel was also great. It was walking distance to many eateries and we even walked to the PNC baseball field from our hotel.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Great hotel. Close by to convention center and easy to walk to dinner or lunch. Check the elevator doors (inside) for current promotions to see how you can increase the points you earn. Convenience store inside the hotel closes around 11PM and Starbucks closes at 5:30 PM.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	The good:\n1.  Great elevator system\n2.  Room service coffee superb\n3.  Excellent valet parking service\n4.  Very comfortable beds\n\nThe bad:\n1.  Took three trips to front desk to get keycards that worked\n2.  Telephone volume too low with no apparent way to increase\n3.  Room was very small with no sitting chair\n4.  Room booked through Expedia, and was very high for the quality level of the room\n\nWe stay is Pittsburgh quite often and mainly at the William Penn.  We wanted to try a hotel in the same price class and quite frankly, next time will be back to the William Penn.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I really enjoyed my stay at the Westin.  During my entire stay I had trouble getting out of bed.  The bedding and comforter were heavenly!  I literally felt like I was laying on a cloud.  The mattress was a pillow top, and the sheets felt like 1 million thread count.  The grand lobby was classy, but not too overwhelming.  The Westin is perfectly situated downtown.  Close to all major attractions and never more than a couple blocks or a short cab ride away.  The green program was a first for me.  It was a little annoying in that the light in the bathroom kept turning off because I kept forgetting to stick my key card in the light switch.  The funniest aspect of their "green" program was the dual shower heads. There is a sign in the shower that reads something along the lines of "we have provided two shower heads for your comfort. However one remains off to save water unless you turn it on."  Now... I don't know about you but I feel if they are trying to achieve some level of green why even bother to put an extra shower head in?  Not to mention if there is a second shower head available to use, I'm certainly not going to pass on it in order to save some water. I know it's not very supportive of going green but come on! \nThe next time I'm in the burgh, the Westin is where I'm staying.  All the negatives I experienced, (expensive parking, extra charges etc.) I let slide, because they were issues that are expected at hotels. All in all I was very pleased!
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I've downgraded my original rating because of the management's response. As stated, the hotel itself was comfortable and the staff was great, but the restaurant sucked.  Very overpriced with a breakfast bar that I'd expect to find at a no-tell motel rather than the Westin.  Management's response completely ignored my complaint about that.  After spending $50 for 3 people's breakfast (and mine was just coffee and a bagel) I expected some response.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	We always stay in Westin Hotels. We are Starwood Preferred guests. We have NEVER had any problems or complaints. We have stayed in Westin Hotels all over the country. But this place is downright disgusting.  Where to start.... No fitted sheets on the beds? Have to call to unlock my mini fridge? The "green energy saving" light switches? The TV movies didn't work? The place is just dirty. From the vents, to the phones, the outlets and light switches, no trash can liners, and the lack of towels. We kept having to call for towels. OH and the house keeping! We left two times during the day and asked them to come clean our room BOTH of those times. We came back the second time and it wasn't cleaned? I called down to complain and told them to send someone in an hour because we were going to nap. Two seconds later, they come to want to clean? I was furious. We were excited that they had an indoor pool and hot tub. I wouldn't step foot in that hot tub ever again. Unless you want to catch a disease. So gross. Paint chipping off inside. The pool is strictly a lap pool. And the women's locker room was nasty. Looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a month. I'm only giving this hotel 1 star because you can't give them zero. The only plus was the shuttle service and driver. Don't stay here, save your money.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Overall a solid hotel, I've stayed here 4 of the last 5 weeks so I have a decent sample size.\n\nPros:\n- BEST gym in any hotel I've ever stayed (100lb dumbbells anyone?)\n- As SPG Platinum, always a high floor or great upgrade, even when busy\n- Consistently clean throughout\n- Visiting sports teams stay here if you're into celeb spotting\n- Check-in staff is friendly\n- Location is great, access to both strip and downtown\n- Option for 500 pts instead of room cleaning\n\nCons:\n- Tough to get a reservation sometimes and they don't cut breaks to regulars (not at discounted rates anyway)\n- Restaurant is ok at best\n- Can be some bizarre crowds depending on convention (http://www.anthrocon.org/ - I'm not hating, but it's unusual)
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Marginal at best for the money. The whole place really does not seem up to the standard of other Westin properties I have stayed at.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Wife and I love staying at the Westin when we are town for sporting events. Convenient to everything in town and a short walk over the Clemente Bridge to the Stadiums.\n\nJust do not understand the complaints about the elevators or the shower head. You are not "stuck" using just a rain water shower head. You do have the option to switch to the regular shower head with the twist of the hand. Wow, is that hard to do?\n\nThe elevators do have a keypad system that tells you which elevator to use. The longest wait we had was about 15 seconds....and there was a convention going on next door at the convention center. And no, we did not "forget" which elevator to get on. Maybe the reviewer should be a bit less self absorbed, get his head away from his phone and pay attention to what's going on around him. Not that difficult folks.\n\nNow that I debunked those two non issues from a previous reviewer, I can tell you we enjoy the amenities the Westin has to offer. Nice friendly staff, excellent location, comfy rooms with a great view, and wonderful heavenly beds.\n\nOh, and lest I forget. The elevators are EASY to use and very functional, as is the shower, whether using the rain shower head OR the regular shower head if you prefer.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	We were in town for a wedding and the group rate at a few of the other big brand hotels were still ~$175/night. We hit up the Priceline a week before the event & landed The Westin for $90/night. From the mixed reviews, I was bracing myself for a total ripoff. an expensive brand that lost it's way but kept the price. But, we had a pretty nice stay. \n\nThe room was nice. Subtle & modern with few amenities. Nothing to warrant the rack rate unless your corporate card is paying. My biggest gripe were the curtains. A place like this needs blackout shades that actually cover the windows. Come sunrise, the tan shades turn the wall into a giant lightbox. If you're a light sleeper, invest in one of those uncomfortable & totally unnatural eyemasks.\n\nFood at the hotel will leave your wallet feeling like it just spent its first night in prison. We had breakfast at the Penn Grille. Everything tasted great, but I'm from NYC and even I'm uncomfortable dropping $12 on granola. Drinks and a pre-Pirates snack at the fish place was really tasty. Still pricey, but damn good food. The scallop-stuffed zucchini blossoms were elegant but full of flavor. And the sushi was also delicious & generous with the portions. I'm wondering if the chef accidentally made two portions, realized his mistake & then said "Fuck it, they look like nice kids." If you truly want the full-on price gouging experience, order the room service. Yeah, I know it's a traditional money maker for hotels, but holy shit, $20 for a pizza. Thankfully, it turned out to be really delicious & plastered with mushrooms.\n\nThe staff was fantastic at every turn. Check-in, bellhop, valet, waiters - oh shit, I almost forgot Randy.\n\nRandy, Randy, Randy. \n\nRandy is a bleached blonde waiter at the Penn Grille. He's also the happiest, most positive man on the fucking planet. I can't overstate how the man yearns to make you smile. People like Randy make me impossibly nervous, so I imagine him as a weekend serial killer. "Randy? Cannibal? IMPOSSIBLE." He's an experience. That being said, I couldn't bare the thought of doing two breakfasts in a row with Mr. Dahmer, so we begged for a table in the back.\n\nThree's not enough, four's too much. Yelp, add the half-star.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Most helpful and friendly staff, Starbucks on site, pool open 24hrs, very clean rooms, two part shower head, fridge, robes, TWO luggage racks, great view, complimentary Disani, and large room.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Per usual, Westin does a solid job.  The rooms are spacious and comfortable with speedy service if you need a light bulb replaced (which we did).  Check-in / check-out were smooth and late check-out was fuss free!\n\nWe had our dog with us and he enjoyed his stay since it was nice and quiet!\n\nOnly significant complaint is that you have to wait 5 minutes to get an elevator when the hotel is busy (which it usually is since it's near the convention center).
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Stayed here for a convention next door, mostly bc it was the most convenient. If I had realized how small DT Pittsburgh was I probably wouldve shopped around a little bit to save some $$$. This place was totally close to lots of things -- the river, the football and baseball stadiums, etc.\n\nBut anyways, had a good two-nite stay.  Clean and quiet rooms, friendly staff (tho I really got the impression that all Pittsburghians are just naturally super friendly.. at least compared to Angelenos). I happen to like that they are making cool environmentally-friendly efforts to save water, power, etc.  Others reviews mentioned it was a hassle to come home to a hot/cold/dark room, but I got two keys at check in (one to keep w/ me, one for the light-switch thing that runs the lights and ventilation). Easy. Problem solved. There wasnt a fridge in the room, but I requested one and someone brought it up within 15 minutes.\n\nThe internet was suuuuuper sloooow. And out of the 30 channels on the TV I think ~12 of them were sports. Ohs wells.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Not as nice as other Westin Hotels. Sink needed to be recaulked. Worn out and chipped furniture. A piece of spinach was left on the comforter. Air vents were dirty and dusty. Overall it was just ok. The bed slept well.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	As with many others, I stayed here for a convention.  There is something to be said for the convenience of walking across an inside bridge to the convention center when it is 38 degrees and sleeting outside.\n\nThat being said, I was surprised by some of the things that were not included for a price of $250 a night.  There is only one night of wi-fi included. After that, it is $9.95 per day. I have stayed in moderate and even budget hotels with FREE wi-fi.  As a work-around, if you are on a low enough floor, the Tonic Bar & Grill has free wi-fi that reaches the hotel.\n\nThere was also no airport shuttle, something I was really surprised by considering the Westin is a convention center hotel.  They should anticipate that most of their guests are going to be mainly at their hotel and the convention so they won't be renting a car.\n\nThe plumbing is extremely loud.  Anytime someone flushes or takes a shower, you are going to hear it.  It was so loud that we thought our toilet was running continuously.\n\nFood options are limited near the hotel, especially after 5 PM.  For those looking for budget dining, a 4-5 block trek is required.\n\nThere are some positives.  The staff is very receptive and responsive.  They also have a full gym with an indoor pool and Jacuzzi.  For guests who forget to bring workout or swim clothes, the hotel offers loaner clothes.  The beds are comfy and they don't skimp on pillows.\n\nFor those looking for environmental friendly options, the hotel has a system in place wherein none of the lights or ventilation in the room operate without the keycard being inserted into a slot near the door.  This guarantees that everything goes off when guests leave the room.  There is also an option to forgo room service in exchange for either a $5 voucher every day or 500 Star Reward points if you are a member.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	The hotel is kept clean and the room rates were very good.  The service from the staff was excellent.  Interestingly enough the restaurant in the hotel has the best sushi in Pittsburgh.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I travel every week for work and was always a Marriott guy until this hotel made me switch to Starwoods. Why? The best gym I've ever encountered at a hotel.  It's so nice that locals can pay to belong to the gym.\n\nThat, and the 500 points for declining room cleaning make this place a winner.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	My boyfriend and I stayed here for a long weekend because we both had interviews in the North Shore area, which was a short car ride away. We got a very good rate on Hotwire--otherwise I don't think we would have been able to stay here. Although the hotel was very comfortable and in a good location, we could hear every noise from the hallway and adjacent rooms (including the bathroom). I was sitting up in bed reading, and every time the people next door closed a drawer in their bureau the whole headboard would shake.\n\nParking was also expensive. We needed to use the car several times during our stay, so we had to valet park, which was over $20/day (plus tips each time we picked up or dropped off the car).\n\nThe coffee shop attached to the hotel is just OK. The breakfast/lunch place was not very good. You will probably have to venture a bit to find affordable and good quality food (other than the hotel restaurant, which I can't comment on because we did not eat there given the high prices).\n\nOne perk--the hotel does offer free internet, but it is a low bandwidth version. We didn't need the internet for work or anything so it was hard to justify paying for the high speed, so we used the free version. It gets the job done for email and web browsing, but it does not stream videos well.\n\nThe bed was comfortable and the shower head was very good. I agree with other reviewers that the amenities were not as nice as I have seen in other Westins--no bathrobe, room service menu not as good, staff not quite as helpful. Also, because it is a green hotel, they will be a little stingy about replenishing your towels and toiletries. If you have a lot of people in your room or for some other reason require extra supplies, be sure to request that. We came back after housekeeping to find that they had given us a half-full bottle of shampoo to replace the one we had used. Not sure if they had just gotten that from someone else's room (gross!) or it had just spilled and they didn't want to waste it. They also failed to replace our in-room coffee and tea supply so we had to call and ask for more.\n\nAll in all, we definitely would not pay full price to stay here, but might consider it again if there was another great deal.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Really poor service and way overpriced. You could make much better choices.They do not keep to a high standard of service.\nThe rooms are not worth the money.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	i got upgraded to a junior suite, and then again to a parlor suite because the junior didn't have two beds as I needed.\n\nStaff was absolutely great in getting us everything we need.\n\nThere's a weird quirk in the green energy program that you can't have light in the bathroom without turning on the AC or heat, but I'll forgive them that. Maybe they can fix it?
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Pretty good hotel. Right there in the center. Parking is expensive 20$
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Still little to no improvement. \n\nNow they've removed fitted bed sheets and just use a single sheet on top of the mattress.\n\nStill stuck with a messed up environmental system that requires a card (any card will do) to keep it going.\n\nBathroom vents looked like an example of how not to clean your duct work.  Dust caked, disgusting.  Not recommended for travelers with allergies or severe asthma.\n\nOnly saving grace was their rain showerhead which can switch over to a hand held shower wand. Different than the traditional Westin Heavenly dual head, but still good.\n\nSorta makes sense seeing all the people posting that they scored this property on Priceline. A shame because in other cities the Westin franchise is a name usually associated with higher end properties.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Nice place to stay if you are not paying. Good location; you can walk to PNC Park, strip market, and many other attractions. The room is decent. A great excercise room. However, it is expensive.\n\nThe room has it quirks. No fridge, microwave, etc...but you can call and get one. They brought up a fridge at no cost, that was cool. The rooms "green features" include a card slot that is near the door you need to put your room key in if you want some of the lights to work. In addition, I cracked up at the shower. They have a two headed shower that is awesome...but they have a sign that says "your shower is turned to single head in an effort to save our most precious resource, water, if you want to use it simple turn the head". Basically it says, if you don't care and want to be a douche, go ahead and turn the shower on you heartless turd.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I stayed here a week ago and was not impressed. The staff was very friendly and informative which was really nice (in comparison to the rest of Pittsburgh). We took the shuttle where ever we went (which was a bonus). But something about the place seemed slightly unclean. The countertop in the bathroom wasn't clean around the taps, and the bathroom in general seemed un clean. We ordered room service and the food wasn't bad, but not something a star hotel should  sell. There was also no bathrobe or slippers. I was not impressed witht that. Overall, not a bad hotel, just lacking for the price.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I liked it here. Believe me - my friends know I'm not a pushover. The price is higher here, but I gotta say. It is still competitive. The bed is great. The linen so fresh. The room feels roomy and the view is so nice. Housekeeping was great during this hotel stay. I like the tv bigger flat screen LG. Good channel choices and movies. \n\nThe shower is great - nice waterfall shower head with added handheld nozzle. Very good. The towels are so much better than average. The robe is so soft and comfortable. The room is clean. There is a fridge to keep beverages cool. The AC works well. Very comfortable. \n\nI requested extra pillows on check in and they were there when I went up to the room. Nice and quiet space too. Got good rest here. Room service was excellent even though they left the glass of milk off. It was ok. I liked the breakfast. Excellent oatmeal. \n\nLocated conveniently in downtown so easy to get to places of interest. Specially convenient for me for the conference in the adjoining conference center. \n\nThey have a brunch on Sunday until eleven am. I slept late and missed it, but it looked good. The Starbucks is right inside the building and also another coffee place is there also  - very good for us coffee lovers. The restaurant bar in the hotel is very nice. Had a lovely brunch this morning with mimosa. Delicious and relaxing. I'm going to try one of their cheeseburgers tonight. Yum yum. \n\nThe fitness center here is well appointed, roomy, with nice windows to view outside while working out. Good free weights. Lots of equipment and all the numerous exercise machines - reclining bike, sitting bike, elliptical stepper, treadmill. No waiting. Nice extra room with hardwood floor with yoga stuff and space  to stretch. \nNot to mention the nice lap pool with relaxing deck chairs and convenient locker room. Also the gym is open 24 hours. Fantastic. \n\nNice lobby with beautiful decor. I can see the baseball stadium from my bedroom window and on Thursday night they set off firecrackers from the river near the stadium to celebrate the baseball teams win. Those fireworks were great. Loved it. I can see all the picturesque bridges over the river from my room too. Very cool view.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I've been here for several events over the past few years and I've always liked this hotel.  It's spacious, clean, and the staff is always friendly.\n\nI've even had an event here when I worked for another company and I can tell you that they are so helpful, knowledgeable, and proactive.  If there's one thing that I've learned organizing events, the staff matters the most when choosing a venue.  And if I had my way, I'd always have events at this hotel.  But I will say that hosting events here is a little pricier than other places, but I think it would be worth it.  \n\nI've also had breakfast and lunch at these events and the food is always delicious and fresh.  I still to this day remember the most phenomenal cobbler I had there...yum!
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	From someone who loves hotels - this is by far the worst Westin I have EVER stayed in - truly the brand should take its name off of this property.  From the substandard housekeeping to the truly poor service, I cannot recommend another hotel choice enough.  Disappointing at every turn.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Being a Southern California boy, I was not particularly looking forward to a conference in Pittsburgh in November.  Granted, November is still usually a little early for snow, but looking at the weather forecast a week before the conference and seeing at least 3 days of snow did not exactly make my day!\n\nBooking my stay at the Westin Convention Center however, made things SO much easier.  They've got a covered sky-bridge directly connecting to the convention center from the 2nd floor.  No need to even put on a heavy jacket to go to your conference.  Everyone else is coming from around the city and bundled up and then has to carry their coats around all day (or check them if the conference is well staffed enough to offer this).  But being connected to the Convention Center I could just stroll across the bridge and right into my sessions.\n\nRooms were well appointed.  Beds were comfortable and the double showerheads were fantastic!  Toiletries were a little sparse.  ABSOLUTELY loved the free wi-fi.  So many full service hotels are charging for this these days and it is a HUGE pet peeve of mine to pay for a more expensive hotel and then to pay for Internet access on top of that.\n\nMy issue with my hotel room (don't know if it is true for all) was noise.  I was close to the elevator, but the door seemed particularly thin as I often heard people walking back and forth down the hall and talking.  I was also able to hear various building noises like running water, etc.  The walls between rooms seemed to be thick enough because I didn't hear other people talking or their TVs (or maybe there just weren't people staying in the rooms to either side).\n\nI enjoyed their room service breakfast menu.  They had a nice offering of healthy alternatives including granola, fresh fruit, yogurt, etc.  Delivery times were pretty spot on and the attendants were friendly and efficient.\n\nAnother big plus for the hotel is that it is connected to the Original Fish Market.  Good sushi, GREAT clam chowder and some other delicious fare.  There's access into the restaurant from the hotel's lobby and it is open until 1am for those late arriving West Coast travelers.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	4.5 stars (but you can't do that so five). Every employee We talked to was super helpful and pleasant. Took the staff elevator due to heavy conference intake. \n\nStaff service just exceeded all expectations and everything was enjoyable. No issues and great location.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	This hotel does not live up to the Westin standards I'm used too. I stay here for business purposes only but would never recommend this place to anyone to stay EVER! The hallways smell as do the rooms and they are not clean at all. Below are a few photos from my most recent stay.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Stayed here recently on a trip... it was nice but nothing special. I don't feel like it was worth $200 a night. I would not stay here again.\n\nI did like the staff and it is in a very walkable area. I was excited that there would be an indoor pool... but disappointed to find that it was a small lap pool. There were restaurants inside of the hotel and a Starbucks. \n\nThe view was gorgeous and it was relatively peaceful at night... but the rooms and amenities were pretty lackluster when the price is considered. I'm sure there are nicer hotels in the area for my next stay.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I had great expectations that were sadly not met. For the price of the room, I was expecting a LOT more for my buck, maybe I was just too optimistic. I will say the whole hotel was clean and didn't have any unsanitary conditions. But it just seemed outdate for the top price paid, it could use a spruce up. Our room was ready before posted check-in time and when we got to the room there were no problems. The wi-fi was free and the tv channel selections were pretty good. I would say this is an average hotel for amenities with a high price tag.\n Usually when you pay top tier rates, I usually expect the service staff to be very friendly, didn't get that here, I think I had one of the service staff actually talk to me unsolicited. I would not revisit The Westin Convention Center.\n My wife would probably give it 4 star just for the shower head, it was pretty amazing, but when that is the highlight, I don't think there is value here.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Stay here a few times a year and love it. Never had a problem.\n\nTheir customer service goes above and beyond. I get an email before my stay (from a real person who I can respond to) if there's info that I need to know. For example, just got one today for a stay this weekend to inform me that a bunch of streets will be closed on Sunday due to the Pittsburgh Marathon, along with specifics about how to get to/from the hotel during this time. Can't beat that!
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	This is a fantastic hotel.  I went to a convention here at the end of June and loved the setting.  The convention center is well setup and the link between the hotel and the convention center works really well, especially if it's raining.\n\nMy only complaint is that the elevators are slow during busy times.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Beautiful rooms, excellent meeting spaces. The beds are like clouds and the double shower head in the bathroom was amazing. \n\nHowever, the customer service lacks excellence and the WiFi is completely unreliable.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I would technically give this place a 3.5\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of Pittsburg water and I feel like the towels were all strange because of it; from texture to smell. Other than that the beds were comfortable, the king size room was spacious and the gym was above average and very equipped. \nThe conference center was clean and beautiful. \n\nService: everyone was really friendly and helpful which I always appreciate the most. It was super odd that the Starbucks and Bill' on site closed in the afternoon on a Saturday. \n\nLocation: The Westin feels like it's right in the middle of everything one would need. From very delicious restaurants to entertainment. Close to major historical sites and the water. Definitely go on the river boat tour, it was such a blast. \n\nWhat I like the most is their eco-friendly options. You can choose to make a few different green choices throughout your stay and that's definitely a plus if you don't mind not having your bed made every morning.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	We got this hotel room via Hotwire at a great price.\n\nThe location was good, although not close to where we were headed while in town. It was easily accessible to the highway. Parking at the hotel is expensive.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that our shower wasn't clean. The walls in the rooms were thin; we could hear our neighbor's dog barking, as well as other people using their showers/bathrooms.\n\nOverall, for what we needed the room for (sleeping after a show), it was fine. But with the thin walls, expensive parking, and the dirty bathroom, i'd never stay at this place again. I've had better experiences in smaller, cheaper hotels.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Although I was only there one night I was pretty impressed with this Westin. From the dual head shower to the comfortable bed and pillows, everything was up to expectations. The real positive is that, although I got a room right across from the elevator (If I had been staying more than 1 night I would have requested a different room) it never became a noise issue. The two criticisms I do have are the breakfast menu in the restaurant, (NO BUFFET!!)  and the lack of concise instruction how the "Green Room" operates. For those of you who haven't experienced this as I hadn't, you put your key in a slot by the  door so you can operate the thermostat and bathroom lights. Good idea, maybe more education at check in. One more small annoyance/observation, it seemed as though the AC turned off at about 3:00 AM and the room became pretty uncomfortable. It was all 6 people in our party in six different rooms, not just me.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Had our parking validated after today's Pirates game. We had a senior citizen with us who was resting for a few minutes due to exhaustion from the heat. Fifteen minutes to get the car out is not enough time for everyone, and the person at the speaker was no help. Enjoy the eight bucks; it will be the last money you'll ever see from me.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	I saw lots of mixed reviews about this hotel when I decided last minute to head to Pittsburgh to take my dad and meet up with my brother at a Cubs/Pirates game fathers day weekend and the Westin still had a few rooms left and as a bonus it's a SPG Starwood hotel so I could get some points for my stay so I booked a couple rooms. I arrived very early, just before 11:00 am, even though check-in time was not until 3:00pm they said they had one of our two rooms ready so we were at least able to drop off our bags in a room before heading out for the afternoon. The girl at the front desk that helped me at check-in was very friendly, although I forgot her name. The hotel is located perfectly in my opinion, lots of bars and restaurants in the area and within walking distance of PNC Park, although the girl at the front desk said they offer a free shuttle to the stadium, the weather was beautiful so we just decided to walk. My room was clean and well kept and the décor in throughout the entire hotel is modern. My only slight complaint is the parking. I come from Chicago and I understand about expensive parking but this hotel charges $22 for overnight self park and $26 for valet. I chose to valet while my brother who drove his own car in from Philly chose to self park his vehicle. The valet service was beyond slow. a couple of times we need both vehicles and he was able to go retrieve his vehicle in the self park lot in half the time it took valet to bring up my car. Valet is supposed to be a convenience, but in this instance it was not, it was more of a burden, and a more expensive burden than the self park. Do not valet at this hotel!!
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	Where do I even start. From beginning to end this hotel has been a nightmare. They emailed us 3x prior to stay telling us we needed to call and "add a name to our rooms" so that our reservations aren't canceled. I added both names, for both rooms each time I have no idea why they could not get this right. After my husband and I check in together they then refused me a key because I wasn't on the reservation even though it was all my contact information and I AM THE ONE THE HARASSED ALL THREE TIMES to confirm the room. Not accepting my photo ID, the same credit card we first checked in with, told me my husband needed to call to add me and then it would be fine. He called, added me and guess what, that Still did not work. After getting so upset to the point of yelling all I want is my room key, the girl at the desk next to her chimes in with a snotty comment. The restaurant in the lobby took us 2 hours and 14 minutes AFTER BEING SEATED for a salad and two drinks. (Getting the salad and one of the drinks wrong). Now I am in my hotel room, I have ZERO toilet paper, three out of the four pillows have black scuff tyke marks on them and it stinks of mildew. Honestly, stay ANYWHERE else but here.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	This hotel is in a great location. Especially for those who are going in for work, I had an event taking place at the convention center and stayed two nights here. When I got in, the check-in was very simple and the service was great. I got a great room, on a higher floor. I got the King deluxe suite. The room was very spacious and comfortable. It had every amenity I was looking for. Speaking of amenities, one of my favorite things about the hotel was the gym. It was not your average hotel gym. The Westin Hotel chain usually has very nice gyms, but this might've been the best one I've seen. It had almost every machine I look for in a gym, and also an adequate amount of cardio machines. I had a great work out while I was there. Again, the location is great because you're in walking distance to downtown Pittsburgh, with all the restaurants. You're about a mile away from the University and also the Andy Warhol Museum. I say that, because I crossed the bridge to go there. I highly recommend going there as well. That will be in a separate review. I had a great view from my room (see photo). I had lunch at the burger joint on the first level, it was pretty good. They messed up my payment and I had to wait an additional 10 minutes and the food was just alright. What was impressive, was the breakfast place on the second floor. I had a server named Randy who is also an artist (see photo.) One of the best servers I think I've ever had. Very spirited, in a great mood for the morning, welcoming, and great service. Shout out to Randy! Also on the second floor, you have access to a walkway that leads you directly to the convention center so you do not have to walk outside. That worked out famously for my event that I was working. In total, this is a great place to stay especially if you are on a work trip. It pretty much has everything that you need.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	We stayed here for ... (drumroll...) a CONVENTION! They had everything we needed and basic operations were quite smooth. \n\nOne problem, our room didn't have plugs next to the bedside for charging cell phones, and wi-fi is free only for your first 24 hours of stay. Printing in the business office was pricey - they imposed an access fee, plus .99 per page. I suggest walking to the nearby Office Depot for your printing services. \n\nOther than the hotel being technologically behind, it was clean, spacious, and pretty much identical to other Westins where we've lodged. Convenient to the convention center, and a small handful of restaurants. We recommend Sushi Kim, if you're 'bent-o that way'.\n\nFor a short weekend convention stay, the Westin did the job.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	A classic example of a hotel that can charge whatever it wants, because it's attached to the conference center.\n\nAmong the extras they charged for: access to the fridge in the room, and *wireless internet.*  These days, free in-room wireless internet is as standard as hot and cold running water.  Parking was also expensive, but, that's to be expected for the location.\n\nOn the upside, the views from the hotel were outstanding, the service was very good, and the rooms were clean.  I also really appreciated having a nice shower with large bath towels; the Westin doesn't skimp there.\n\nIf you're at a conference, you're probably staying here regardless of yelp reviews.  If you're just looking for a hotel downtown, this wouldn't be my first choice.
h23R_mGy3ZdKlOYj57bheQ	When I think of Westins, I think of business-classy, nice and modern. This hotel has a classic feel to it, but definitely not very updated. Unfortunately, it reminds me of the staid-ness of Pittsburgh too much.\n\nThe check-in desk was super slow during my stay there. I do like the fact that there's a Fish Market downstairs. I don't like the fact that it's the convention center hotel, so it can get pretty crowded. That said, it's within walking distance to the Strip, and Downtown, so you can't deny the convenience. Still, I think there are newer hotels that provide the same.
6Qpy6U_IPP-r_vZKTmugMw	Adorable brand new corner store from the owners of GUS and Pastaga. It's so great to see local neighbourhood chefs coming together to put local product on the shelves for local consumers. The space is full of sunlight and smells of fresh bread. You can grab local sausages here, or regular grocery things like flour or oranges or avocados alongside locally made preserves and pickles from Preservation Society, or small batch tonic, or organic milk. I'll be back for sure!!
6Qpy6U_IPP-r_vZKTmugMw	It is tiny, that's for sure but there is a lack of foot traffic so it's ok to stay around.\n\nIt's the third type of store on this corner and I hope this one sticks.\nIt's well laid out, has good prices (mostly).\nThe baguettes and coffee are the standouts for me, as well as the sandwiches that are pre-made but pre-made with love.
6Qpy6U_IPP-r_vZKTmugMw	Que ce soit pour un grill cheese régulier ou un de leurs autres sandwichs, Le petit coin est un endroit réconfortant. Attention, il ne s'agit pas d'un restaurant mais bel et bien d'une petite épicerie de quartier qui offre café et des petits plats à emporter. On y trouves de tout à très bon prix. Les produits locaux et internationaux  sont variés donc si on est mal pris, on peut facilement trouver ce qu'il nous manque, de la viande de gibier jusqu'au Kraft Dinner. Le personnel est chaleureux et accueillant.
6Qpy6U_IPP-r_vZKTmugMw	This place is amazing. I have to say I don't do my groceries there or buy anything really except for the grilled cheese.\nIt is actually the best grilled cheese I have ever had and I go there on the regular to get it.\nIt's 3.75$ the cheese is EVERYWHERE and its perfectly grilled and melted.\nI don't know how they do it but I must say I am so happy to have this gem in the neighbourhood!
6Qpy6U_IPP-r_vZKTmugMw	Je suis vraiment très contente d'avoir cette nouvelle mini-épicerie juste à côté de chez nous! Quoique j'aimais quand même l'épicerie qu'il y avait là avant... Bref, les produits disponibles sont très éclectiques, allant du porc Gaspor à des nouilles ramen, en passant par des oeufs de caille et des bottes d'herbe. \n\nBeaucoup de fruits et légumes disponibles. Ironiquement, j'y suis allée une fois pour ramasser des ingrédients pour une salade très conservatrice, repas avec la belle-famille oblige (genre laitue, tomate, oignon, vous voyez le genre!). Eh ben, j'en ai pas trouvé, et j'ai fini par faire autre chose totalement.\n\nLes grilled cheese ne sont vraiment pas chers (autour de 5$), et sont délicieux! J'ai goûté celui au canard et l'autre au boeuf. Dégoulinants, rassasiants, goûteux: je n'aurais rien pu demander de mieux.
6Qpy6U_IPP-r_vZKTmugMw	What a lovely addition to the rapidly evolving Beaubien/St. Laurent area! It really is like an old school corner grocery, with lots of local produce, breads, meats and gourmet treats. I stop by regularly after work to grab dinner ingredients I'm missing at home. Plus, it comforts me to know that all the fixings and mixings for a perfect cocktail can be found on their shelves. It even has classic convenience items such as lighters, Kraft Dinner, candy, tylenol and trojans. I wish they had a wider variety of fruit... but I guess you can't really get around that during winter in Montreal.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	This is my "go to" Costco for all of my needs.  It's the closest to my home, and I'm here on a regular basis to get all sorts of things.\n\nI love Costco for all same reasons everyone else does.  This location is like all the others in the Valley-ample parking, good hours, free samples on Saturdays, and of course, the hot dogs.  I get one every time I'm here! \n\nI also like Costco because now they have their coupons loaded onto the membership card when you check out.  I found this out a while ago, when I picked stuff up that was on special, and the discount came right off at the register, without me having to whip out any coupons.  Makes life easier when you forget stuff like that, or when your stopping in and forget to bring the coupons with you.\n\nOverall I like it here, easy in easy out, and the staff is always friendly and helpful.\n\nMy only complaint about Costco as a whole, is that I find some of their selection limited.  No name brand cat food, (Kirkland brand only), no 40 ounce Nivea in a blue bottle (they carry the skin firming crap in the white bottle, but I don't use it...I use the regular lotion in the blue bottle.)  They used to carry this stuff years ago, but since I've become a member again, it seems thier stock has somewhat changed, and I'm kinda dissapointed about it.\n\nOverall, Costco rules, and I love shopping here.  Always on my short list of places to stop for just about anything!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I think they should stay open later Fri.,St. & Sundays because people work on the weekdays. I love how Costco is getting more into the organic industry and real food unlike the TV commercial food.  I am very sad that the Costco Corporation decided  (an obvious selfish attempt to make more money) to take away the Delicious Hebrew national hot dogs which are the best hotdogs on he market unless you go straight organic from a different store and replace them with Kirkland "all beef hot dogs" which is most certainly not all beef and of much lesser quality. Maybe it's all from cows buts it's the everything in the cow that is not sellable until ground up. ENJOY EVERYONE!!‼‼
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Love Costco Glibert. Strong product offerings, ample parking space, and plenty of trees to get some covered parking during the worst summer months in Arizona. Would return but I no longer live in the area. Just catching up on Yelp reviews.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Gotta love Costco and their great prices and foods. Finally a store brand, Kirkland, that tastes good and is actually a Great Value... Most of the time. It's generally busy here which doesn't bother me too much because there is so much open space. However I refuse to shop here on the weekends, takes forever to check out. Strange thing I just realized is even when they are packed they don't have all checkout lanes open. In fact I don't think I've ever seen that here, even on days where it feels like you are in Disneyland, I'm talking to you - the day before thanksgiving. Food at the food court tastes amazing as always and is super greasy. Love the samples.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	The best ! !   Especially the gas station, it's always clean and employees are always friendly
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Costco is awesome!  Great place to load up on essentials and not have to keep buying them each time you go shopping.  I recommend you buy a slice of pizza or hotdog to reward yourself after shopping!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I wish they would post the hours of operation for the main store, pharmacy and tire center. Nothing on google or their web site. I need tires but every time I go there they tell me I will have a two hour wait. If I knew what time they opened I could get there 30 minutes early and wouldn't have such a long wait in 115 degree heat. Calling the main number the recording doesn't mention hours for tire shop. I'm pretty sure they open before the main store but don't know how much earlier.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	This review is for the Optical Dept only.\n\nWe've been  members of Costco since 1994. \nAnd today, we've encountered the rudest Licensed Optician to date. \n\nWe got a ticket. We waited patiently for 30 minutes to be helped. We noticed that people that came AFTER us were and have been helped before us. So I sent my niece to inquire if they're using the ticket systeme to help customers. The Licensed Optician said were next and dismissed my niece.\n\nWe're new to glasses or getting glasses. So we asked the License Optician Karen. Our inquiries were greeted with rude and condescending comments, loaded with such a negative attitude... "What? You didn't ask your eye doctor?!" We explained that we were seen by the eye doctor mid 2015. She rolled her eyes, and continued on using unfamiliar terminologies. So we asked. After all, we are paying customers, and we were proper customers. She didn't quite like that we inquired. Deep sighs, sarcasms, and more eye rolling followed suite.\n\nWe will never use the Optical Department again. I wonder if the reason we were treated like shit is because we were the only brown skin at that time? Very odd indeed.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I Go there a lot over the years. I just started to review places I go to. For bulk stuff it's great some times we think we are getting a deal but in reality we are not. I go there because they got good stuff.  But back to why I am writing this review we got pizza for my crew and it was cheap and good fed 8 guys for 20 bucks great deal.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I wish the budget allowed me to shop at Costco every weekend! I wish I could get all my groceries from Costco! This Costco is awesome, it is never too packed, they have good prices and carry most of the items I need. I stopped at a Tempe Costco recently and I now appreciate this Costco location even more.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Not really sure why people grip about the membership price to get in here.. I mean, it's $50, but you will save more than that if you come here enough- especially for the necessities (toilet paper, garbage bags, etc.). If you're gonna have to eventually buy it, why not buy in bulk and save money? I've never had to check myself out, there's always people to load it on the conveyer belt for me..\n\nI typically come here loaded with the coupons that they send in the mail and really helps.. what's even better are the instant savings (for specific items though..) I love the fact that I can find almost everything here, so much that I may have bought some things in excess. : /\n\nThe only things I don't like about Costco is that the aisles are not labeled with what is down there, so it would really help me since I'm typically hauling a 300 lb. cart trying to find a particular item around the entire store with my 2 year old. It's a little hard to get hold of an employee unless you are near the registers.\n\nOtherwise I really like this place since it reduces my trips to the supermarket!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I LOVE COSTCO.  It is practically my Disneyland.  Because stock changes periodically, it's always an adventure strolling down the wide aisles.  The customer service and return policy is the best around.  The quality of the produce and foods here are fantastic and come out to be much cheaper per unit than at the regular grocery store.  Aside from picking up bulk groceries, I've gotten photos here, had an eye exam, ordered contacts.\n\nSome must-buys: bacon, cheese, berries, gas, alcohol, salsa, tortilla chips, snacks, coconut oil, pickles, almond butter, spices spices spices.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I love Costco.\n\nBecause they're reliable, have quality items (none of this rip-off, second-rate Sam's stuff), have a decent generic brand (Kirkland), and do awesome and affordable photo processing.\n\nAnd have yummy free samples.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	It's been a long while since I've visited this Costco location.  Went here yesterday to search for holiday sales of organic Fair Trade coffee, other than that High Desert Roasters Organic Rainforest medium roast Peruvian whole beans I usually buy at the 101/Hayden Costco in Scottsdale.**  Instead, I found bags of Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf Organic Mexico medium roast 100% Pure Arabica whole beans.  The bag states "Direct Trade," but is it Fair Trade?***  Hmm...  At $12 for a two-pound bag, I thought I'd give Costco's 100% Money Back, No Questions Asked guarantee policy a shake; I hope I won't have to test this policy...  \n\nI also found Panasonic eneloop 2100-cycle 2000 mAh rechargeable kits, originally $30, on sale for $24; That's a $6 auto rebate.  (Amazon is currently selling these kits for $33.49.)  These kits come with batteries that are pre-charged "with Solar Power 2" and are labeled to hold charges for up to 10 years!  That's eight AA and four AAA Ni-MH batteries, two C and two D adapters, and an "advanced charger."  Sorry, but I forgot to check until how long this auto rebate is good for.**  I bought a kit years ago, but a certain someone (who will not be named) threw a few batteries away, not knowing they were rechargeable.  In the years succeeding, she's also thrown away other 2000 mAh rechargeable brands I'd replaced them with- Energizer and amazon basics (Ni-MH 2000 mAh 8-packs are currently being sold for $19.54 and $18.99 on Amazon, respectively).  I use these batteries to power a wireless keyboard, wireless mice and DVD remotes (these are where the AAA cells come in handy), our DirecTV remotes, and the three lovely sets of flameless candles I've purchased at Costco (intricate versions are offered during the Christmas holiday season, so watch out for them now).\n\n**Hmm... I just now noticed that nowhere on this product does it mention Fair Trade, or even Direct Trade.  Guess I'm really ISO new organic coffee beans sold by companies that support sustainability!\n\n***Fair Trade vs. Direct Trade.  Which do you support?
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Love Costco! Clean store, friendly employees (if you can find any; it is difficult to find people to help you find stuff), and good benefits. You can only buy stuff with cash or American Express in the store, but this is just another way they keep prices down.\n\nLines are long on the weekends, but if you come at off-peak times you can make your way through the store fairly quickly. Staff is knowledgeable and there is a ton of selection of products. The quality of the food here is higher than other clubs and sometimes you can get things here that you can't get in a normal grocery store. Watermelons are great, produce in the refrigerated section is fresh, and they have a huge selection of wine and alcohol ranging from cheap to expensive. Meats are fresh and even salmon is often fresh and odorless.\n\nUnfortunately some products that become favorites are only seasonal or only carried for a limited time, but sometimes if you talk to the management they can get the products back in the store. \n\nGas is inexpensive and high quality, you get cash back with the Costco Amex (you can only pay for gas with Costco cards or a PIN debit card). Once again, you can expect a high quality with Costco products, and if you ever have a problem, their customer service is fantastic. The employees care about their guests and you can tell they are treated well by the company.\n\nThumbs up!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Terrible customer service today. We have a business transferable credit card for Costco and have NEVER had a problem. We are a part of a non profit organization that has multiple campuses. The cashier questioned us then called over the manager - they had to look up our business account. I had to have our manager text me her photo ID and proof we were with our company. People from our corp use these transferable credit cards all the time and we have never had an issue. I think this location treats you like you're a criminal not a customer. \nThe one off of Market street is so much nicer. I will not be returning.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I enjoy going to this Costco. You have to make sure to get there early b/c it gets packed really quickly. They always have an adequate amount of check out lanes open
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Usually great customer service. Tonight I went for gas at 9:15. Was told by nearby attendant that gas closes at nine. Had my Costco app open in my hand which says 9:30. He was not interested, and confirmed there was nothing he could do because the pumps are already off.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I have been a Costco customer for eons, and I have always been very satisfied with them.  But this last summer, I was going to use one of their vendor/subcontractor services for buying and installing new hardwood flooring in my home.  Eventually, I went to someplace else.  This vendor/subcontractor gave me the worse customer service you can imagine.  Misquote (or quoted) 3 different prices on different occasions; claimed he couldn't remember dealing with us despite us being in his store on 3 different occasions; wouldn't come out to bring samples and insisted we come to his showroom; and the last straw was when he was a no-show for a measurement appointment in our home.  While he was only a vendor/subcontractor, my complaints to Costco headquarters went unanswered.  I wrote letters; called their HQ; and even went thru customer service on their website -- all to no avail.  The only conclusion I can draw is Costco doesn't want to hear about problems, they just wish complaining customers just go away. The purpose for this posting is to perhaps warn Costco customers not to use vendor/subcontractor services -- dealing with Costco directly might be OK, but not their vendor/subcontractors.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Finally I feel like a real adult because I got a Costco card this year! Granted, as part of a family membership, but lets not get hung up on semantics. It doesn't change the adult quota stock points. I eat dessert for breakfast, go to bed when I wanna, and get giddy from the idea of spending under $4 for a pack of 40 water bottles. \n\nBAM! \n\n::adult card thrown down::\n\nThe cafe prices are unbeatable so don't forget to bring some cash to spend on a hot dog, slice of pizza, churro, or giant cup of soft serve on your way out the door. \n\nAs for the poor guys up front, towards the entrance, that ask to speak to you for a moment about DirectTV (Seriously, why? Oh, right-right, because I'm an adult). I feel so bad that I brush them off (because let's be honest that's probably what everyone else does too), but I don't have time for that when I've got some free samples to indulge in, comfy sweatpants to check out, need to stock up on food like I'm feeding a few very hungry soccer teams or filling the shelves in an underground bomb shelter, and most importantly, to hug MEGA-JUMBO Teddy Bears (when they are in season)...because that is what an adult does!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Love going to Costco to eat lunch and stock up on our lunches for the week.  Wish all of the locations had the same things.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Don't write me off as a simplistic food reviewer, but CostCo pizza is really really good. For $2.59 you get two thick slices of pizza (cheese, pepperoni or supreme) and a large fountain drink.\n\n***************************************************************\nIs it KOSHER to do two reviews of the same place? This time it's all about the hot dog! The other review was on the pizza, so they warrant two totally different reviews, right?\n\nFor a buck fifty you can get a Hebrew National dog (see, now you get it Kosher, huh, I'm witty) and a soda. And people, it's a big dog. There's not a lot of options. You can ask for kraut at the counter, but standard fixings are yellow mustard, katsup, sweet pickle relish and onion.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	What is not to love about Costco?  Oh, maybe that the bathrooms are so far away, the lines to pay are usually long (they do move quickly though) or that the snack bar doesn't take debit cards.\n\nWell, even with these little problems I still love shopping at Costco.  The products are good, the prices are good, the samples are fun and delish and the coupons are a bargain.\n\nLove my Costco membership!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Only went for tires.  The guys there are great.  When I broke a rim and needed a couple tires swapped around they mounted two and realized my old spare was toast.  Chris and Phil mounted an older tire I had on hand.  Thanks guys.  10/10 would but tires here again.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I like going in the early afternoon during the week. I avoid the weekends and the weekdays after 4pm like the plague. Crowds drain me. I avoid them when shopping. \n\nI like the bulk prices, clean store, friendly staff. However, I'm not the exploratory type, though that is one of the personalities Costco markets. That's why there are no aisle signs. They want you to explore, discover, and search for what you need - in hopes you stay longer and end up buying more of what you see, even though you don't need it. It works, even on me. I admit.\n\nAll in all I go because I have a consuming family. So buying in bulk saves me money and time because - in theory - we won't run out of things as quickly.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I love Costco.  Great prices, decent customer service, great lunch deals!  Where else can you have a 1/4 pound hot dog and a drink for $1.60?  Of course they have free samples that encourage you to buy an item.  They sometimes hook me with those.  But you can have lunch every day in that place and never spend a penny.  And like Elle said, the items are a much higher quality than Sams Club.\n\nIf you didn't know, Costco is a warehouse club that sells things in bulk.  Then also have jewelry and electronics that are a great deal.  I often order items from the web-site when I can get free shipping.  Also note that they have great prices on tires (often beating Discount Tire) and gasoline.  The pumps are a little hidden on the east side of the building, but they have plenty of them.  No diesel though.\n\nThe only downside to this Costco is the parking.  Holy shit!  There have been many times when I've wanted to go postal on the morons who are parking their 25 foot long SUV's in tiny assed spaces blocking the entire aisle for 10 minutes while they lube up the sides to squeeze in.  All this while they yap on the phone and adjust their tits/nuts.  But then, I'm impatient.  I usually park on the side lot south of the tire shop.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Typically the most economical place to purchase gas, provided you're a member.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Costco is one of my favorite places on earth.   I get all my electronics, computers, cameras etc.  How can you go wrong with their return policy and high quality products?   The food is great too.  \nWe like to get the $10 large pizza or $1.50 hot dog and drink.  There are just too many great things about this place.  The membership fee is a fraction of what you can save by shopping here.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Shhhh! \n\nIf you promise not to tell, I'll tell you a secret. There's a *certain* kid who has a birthday coming up, and if you were looking for a *certain* toy that costs at least double everywhere else, this is where you would go. \n\nThat's one of the things I do enjoy about Costco. They bring stuff in and out pretty quick, so every trip there is different than the last. But there are also the staples in the foods and home goods sections that you can stock up on when you need to.\n\nThis location stands out because after having been a few times, I've yet to have too hard of a time parking and it's always been pretty tidy. Please note, however, that I have yet to visit on a Saturday. Saturday at a Costco? What--do you have a death wish?
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Costco is my religion. It is my heart, blood, and soul. It is my lord, and personal savior. It's my Madonna. Everything at Costco is amazing. Everything. I will fight or slice someone who dare speak ill of Costco. I wish that everything I own, use, and operate was Kirkland brand. I want a Kirkland wedding, and a Kirkland created husband.  I dream of the day that Costco rules the United States in a form of glorious Communist Retail Utopia!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Costco never disappoints. Looking for bulk items? Costco is your place with great prices and quality!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	If you need tires go see Art at Costco.  He was a great help and educated me about my tires without making me feel like a dumb woman. He didn't try to upsell me, he actually sold me tires that were cheaper because he said the quality was better.  I would highly recommend getting tires from here.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Best prices on snacks, gas, protein bars, cereals, gas and cheese. Every Costco is a little different. You might find something at one and not at another but you will always find something you like at a great price no matter which one you go to. The pizza at the food court is actually pretty good too and it's only 10 bucks for a large pie. They have some pretty good frozen yogurt in a large quantity for under 2 bucks and it tastes just like ice cream. You can never go wrong with a Costco membership. I've been one for years and have never regretted it.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	This is also my favorite Costco, with an easy to get to location.  During the construction on Arizona, it's especially useful to access this Costco via the back driveway onto the small side streets within the block.\n\nI can reliably get  Lean Cuisine in bulk at this Costco for two bucks each.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Costco has things that Sam's Club does not.  I feel that their bakery is superior.  I also like their meats a little better.  Costco has more of their brand items as well.\n\nThey offer 3 types of membership- business, gold key and executive.  I have seen them raise their prices over the past 5 years.  We are on a membership with my family and business and our executive membership pays for itself as well as a few other memberships.\n\nCostco has coupon books throughout the year that can give you even better deals on items.  I also know that if you are looking for a deal, to notice in the price if the last number is a "7".  I have found air freshners on clearance for $3.97, as well as other items for a great deal.\n\nTheir cafe has changed little over the years.  We really like their food- except for their non-fat yogurt.  It tastes like marshmallow fluff to me.\n\nIn addition, check out Costco's website.  They have deals there that they do not have in their stores.  My sister got her wedding invitations at a great deal online.  Their travel section is pretty good too.  Not great, but getting there.\n\nI personally find this location more crowded than the other ones.  I know it is all about location though and going to the one that is closest to where you are.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I love Costco. I usually do quite a bit of fresh food grocery shopping here. The produce is great and decently priced. When I go to Safeway for strawberries it's always a matter of finding the container with the least moldy ones, not so at Costco. They've just started selling crab stuffed portabella mushrooms which are delicious!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Lets hear it for Costco! Costco has great customer service, clean aisles, openness, good deals on: gas, food, home, clothes... and selling my favorite pizza by the slice - Plus, I LOVE the free samples! If you are handing out free food, I'm there! (Maybe that's why Yelp events are so much fun for me!!) \n\nI love coming to this location because it's really close to my house and it's not usually too crowded so I get pretty good parking. If any one wants to come with me on a Saturday for some free samples just let me know! :D
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	As I worked here for a week, i observed the comings and goings of this Costco. The lines at the register at times stretched way back into the aisles, but for the most part Costco opened extra lanes for members to go through. The average wait time was about 10 minutes especially on weekends, lunch time and between 5pm and 6:30pm. The managers as usual were hit and miss, with the majority being unfriendly and stand offish. The employees though were always helpful and nice to me and the members. The snack shop did a good job also of moving people through when they order food and the pizza at this location was pretty good, still at $1.99 per slice. They added a brisket and turkey sandwich, but did not try those items.\nDo not agree with that receipt check on the way out, it is just a bit too much. This location is very crowded and good luck trying to grab a sample on a weekend, the members swarm those carts and things get crazy for a free taste of anything.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Costco Food Court has new hot dogs! Now they aren't Hebrew National anymore, so they aren't Kosher, but they are all beef and delicious.  I had the polish, I prefer it to a regular dog, and I like it more than the old Hebrew National polish dogs.  It has more of a bite to it, definitely more pepper flavor to the dog. Still the same price $1.50 + tax for a dog and a drink.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	This is the my favorite Costco. It's less than 8 miles from my house and the staff are so nice. Most important, the fruits are fresh.\n\nNot all store are dealing with customer the same way. I find that customers shop at this location are more polite than other location. The parking lot are a lot of bigger than other location.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I love Costco and this location is a good one. As with most if not all Costco's, this one can get crowded. I have found it is always clean, the restrooms included, plenty of carts available and if you're lucky enough to get there before they put the samples away, a buffet awaits. I'm lucky enough to live right in the middle of the triangle created by this location, the Costco near Chandler Mall and the Costco in Tempe on Elliot. It really depends on what I'm doing when I decide which location to go to. I have not had a bad experience here and have found the staff to be pleasant and helpful.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	The customer service here  is terrible. Employees make false accusations and their membership is a rip off. You don't save money here if you know how to shop savvy! What a load of crap!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Still giving this a 5 star.\n\nMost recently, I bought a step ladder and while at the checkout, Steve noticed that one of the rungs of the ladder was dented.  I didn't see this.  He took my dented ladder, put a tag on it, and went and got me a good, non-dented ladder.  This is employees taking the time to care for their customers.  Though I didn't notice it, I'm sure my husband would have noticed and that would have caused me to need to come back and return it.\n\nI've never had a problem with any time I've had to return things here, either.  It's very efficient and the personnel at this counter are always nice and professional.\n\nThe guys at the gas pump, particularly Manny & Jim, are top notch.  They've been there for years and I always appreciate and enjoy seeing them.  Since the gas pumps pump gas so quickly, I rarely get much time to chat with either of these gentlemen.\n\nThe only suggestion I have is for your cart returns, why don't you make them like WinCo's?  Yes, I know your carts are bigger, but WinCo has cart returns that are the most efficient of any store I go to.  They have a 2 aisle (not sure what you would call this) return that are opposing.  Carts go only 1 direction in one aisle from one end, and then one direction from the opposite end.  WinCo has this from main aisle to main aisle so that when Cart Man has to go from Main Parking Aisle 1, he can just easily cross to Main Parking Aisle 2 easily, then to Main Parking Aisle 3.  I've seen him do this in a manner of a few minutes go through several Main Parking Aisles.\n\nCurrently Costco has such a big cart return area that people just basically throw all the carts in willy nilly.  Then the person picking up the carts has to sort through and organize the carts, which takes time and is inefficient.  He has to address the carts in each parking aisle separately and can't easily go from one parking aisle to the next easily.\n\nCustomers suck in returning carts often, but if you had something similar to WinCo's, yet accommodating your big carts, it would cut down on time gathering carts as it would automatically be organized.  What makes WinCo's cart returns better also is there is a swing door thing that only allows carts to go in one way and in that one cart return aisle.  \n\nLowe's and some WalMarts do have the 1 cart return aisle, but that 1 way swing door makes a huge difference in keeping only carts going in one direction facing one direction.\n\nYes, I also understand you guys have carts with 2 different sizes, and you can accommodate this, too, just another cart return aisle for these.  Hope that makes sense as Costco is known for their efficiency.  Why not make the cart returns efficient, too?  Also, place an area where people who don't want their "boxes" that you guys put stuff in that they can discard there.  I see people leave these boxes in the carts and that must be a pain in the butt to remove and gather all the carts together.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Big selection, reasonable prices.. I love buying in bulk because not only do you save, you get quality products. And it matters to get a good product for a good price.\nI usually buy their produce and I love how it always tastes great!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	You've seen one Costco, you've seen 'em all, they say. Or so I've heard. Maybe I just say that because I've never really met a Costco that I didn't like.\n\nThis one is a particular favorite because it's so close to my work and I can count on my hand the number of times I've seen the catastrophically long lines at the gas station that I've seen at other Costcos (*cough* 44th Street I'm looking at you *cough*). There's almost never a wait and I've been during all times of day.\n\nIf you live alone and are lazy like me, you find that running out of toilet paper is a hard reality sometimes. Buying it at Costco solves the problem of quantity without draining your wallet. You'll find bulk versions of most home staples like toilet paper, paper towels, dish soap, swiffer refills and kitchen staples like coffee, juice packs, and condiments in quantities that you didn't think were necessary. But they are.\n\nCustomer service is ok for the most part but I did notice on my last trip that they have more of those independent sales contractors on site who can be kind of pushy. Otherwise, your average Costco experience and average isn't a bad thing!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	This is our preferred location because it usually has an electric scooter or even two available. My mother and I are both disabled, her more than I so she almost always gets one right away. The employees inside the store are somewhat scarce when you need help but the checkout employees more than make up with it with their speed, accuracy and above all, their pleasant manner in which they speak with you and do their job. Very happy and satisfied with this location and I drive further from my house, which is near the Sossaman store because of the scooter and employees.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Love their all beef hot dogs, and it's so easy to sneak in there to eat with no membership!  Thanks, Costco.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	This review is for the Costco tire center at Country Club and Baseline in Gilbert.\n\nBought a set of 4 tires from them.  When I got my truck home I noticed they had removed my nice metal valve stem caps and replaced them with plastic caps.  Complained to the store and got shoved over to the "tire manager" who did absolutely nothing.  Complained again and never heard back.  \n\nHey Costco - where's my stolen property?  Do you even care?  Oh - that's right, you don't.  I gave you 2 chances to care and you obviously don't.  \n\nDiscount Tire - I will never stray again.  Live and learn.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Places I DON"T shop:\n1. Places that make me check out my own groceries (like Fresh and Easy)\n2. Places that make me pay to shop there (Costco, Sam's Club)\n3. Places that make me bag my own groceries (Fresh and Easy and Winco)\nGive me a break. Whatever happened to customer service???\n\nOur family tried Costco for one year and decided that we were nuts to pay to shop here.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	You can't help but love the Costco gas station. The price is great, the location is good, there are plenty of pumps and they keep the line moving. The machine that takes your Costco card and a credit card is pretty easy to use and if you have a problem there are always a couple of attendants around to help you out. Good job Costco!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	The one time I forget my card they deny me any access to the card services, food court, bathrooms, nothing. My family has been part of costco for years and never had just a rude accusation thrown at me. I think we might be discontinuing our membership after this! Terrible!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	There costumer service is great. True 2 there word.help me as needed. Bath room was clean.food was hot.and good. Look forward 2 every week 2 go.less then 10mns from my door.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I frequently this Costco alot. I usually come here to buy hard drives for work. The price is real good and seems like the Hard Drives I buy are always on sale.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I love this store.  I have yet to have any issues here.  They have great stock.  They employees are friendly.  The food has been good.  We joke that just take the art of items you buy and multiple it by $10 and you have your total you spend for the day, lol.  We go there for the bulk items mostly and the munchies venders, lol.  It's like meals on wheels or a picnic while we shop. :)  Good Deals, too.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	What can you say about Costco. Employees seem very friendly however like all Costco locations this one is pretty busy. May choose to avoid this location as it was seriously busy.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Who doesn't love Costco?!\n\nEach Costco varies with their products..\n\nGreat for buying in bulk or large quantities!\n\nIf you see asterisk next to the price tag that mean they are discontinuing the product. Stock up on that product!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Aww yea, baby! By far my second favorite Costco (my first favorite one is in Honolulu and only because I can get Macadamia nut Hershey's Kisses!).\n\nThis has a gas station and...though my digestive tract hates me for it, a kick ass cheese selection. The Costco back in the 408/415 doesn't hold a candle to this Costco in cheese selection.\n\nI avoid any costco during their demo hours because frankly, I have zero desire to be shoved aside by hungry little mothers with their monster kids. I detest trying to maneuver around people randomly stopping to chat to the demo person and having their cart blocking off an aisle. Have some consideration, ok? Not all of us are there to eat!\n\nThe best perk to this Costco? It's less than 10 minutes from my house. WOO HOO!\n\nBummer they don't take other credit cards because I would love to get flight miles, but it's ok...I was persuaded to finally get an Amex and now I get back some rockin' rewards!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I love Costco.  Good stuff at reasonable prices, plus pharmacy and optical and gas and bakery.  See my other Costco review (from Chandler) for most of my comments.  This store doesn't use the hand scanners I mentioned in the other review, but otherwise it's much the same.\n\nOne thing I will note is that their berry smoothie from the lunch counter isn't as "berry" as it used to be.  Not sure if it's just this one, or if it's all Costcos.  But it was not as flavorful as it used to be.\n\nOnly accepts American Express, cash, or checks.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	I love this Costco! I've never been to this location but their customer service skills are phenomenal I came here 25 minutes after they closed not knowing that the store closed at 6 o'clock on Saturdays. The out door was still open because there were still people leaving the store, I asked one of the clerks if I could just run back and get some dog food since I ran out that morning. They were kind enough to escort me back to the dog food even though they were closed for the night! Costco never disappoints!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Costco is the best. While their meats are not always the cheapest, you can always count on Costco for the best price on fruit (frozen and fresh), vegetables, and home supplies. I've gotten great deals here for other various items like vacuums, toiletries, medicine.. you name it.\n\nThe Costco bakery is a game changer and my go-to for pot lucks. Their cookies are SOOO good. \n\nPlus, I go here for cat food and cat litter.\n\nThe only negative would be how long the checkout lines can get. I'd love it if they had an Express line for people who are buying 5 items or fewer. (Yes, sometimes I run in to buy a single bag of frozen strawberries - it can get frustrating lining up behind people with massive Costco hauls.)\n\nCostco parking lots are always a mess, but this one is less of a mess than others.\n\nI've always found the employees at the Gilbert location to be much nicer than the Tempe location.\n\nReturns are a breeze, but don't be the asshole returning something you clearly got plenty of use from.\n\nPro tip if you need photographs from Costco: download the app and upload photos on your phone, then they'll be ready for you the next time you mosey down to Costco!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	This is a great Costco location. Saturdays are crazy of course but sometimes you have to do what you have to do. I'm always super impressed by their meat selections, their cuts are leagues beyond any standard grocery store and you probably won't find better without going to the local butcher shop.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	This was the best experience I had at this Costco, Because there was an air purifier at a great price for $100. It kill germs and cleans the air very good and does many more. The day that my mom got this air purifier it helped her to breathe much more better. Also at this Costco there was lots of samples to try if you wanted to try something, So I think you should come to this location more often.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	My wife decided to shop at the last minute 5 mins to spare from closing time. Don't do it, I don't like shopping here but I guess they pre-close at this location or their registers went haywire. Lines at the register were a mile long and needless to say I'm never coming back to Costco anywhere.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	DON'T ORDER ON ONLINE AT COSTCO.COM\nThis is much better than talking to idiots at customer service.  If they can not handle in irate client who is getting married in just a few days and is not notified in ANYWAY that their ring indeed did ship the previous day, then grow a thick skin but don't EVER tell me to act professional because I am extremely pissed at that moment.\nORDERING ONLINE IS MUCH BETTER AT AMAZON BUT COSTCO FAILS IN EVERY RESPECT OF KEEPING THEIR CUSTOMERS notified of shipping details and tracking numbers.\nMy advice:  Steer clear of ordering anything online with Costco and don't bother customer service as they have no method of working with irate clients.  What they want is a paper cut person who is overjoyed that they have been left in the dark and enjoys being on the phone for almost 30 minutes trying to find out WHY an email was not sent out.  If the dumb ass associate I spoke to would have dropped his thin skinned liberal attitude and said "I apologize on how the system failed to get an email to you, there is no excuse for that.  I will forward this to our tech team and have them look into it and what went wrong."  But don't ever tell an already high anxiety, irate customer to "Act Professional" because acting professional is the last thing on my mind.\nI did not order a raft or a hair dryer, this is for my wedding at the end of this week.  With everything else we have to do to prepare for our special moment the last thing I needed was to wonder where is my ring that I have no control over.  This experience was bad in so many ways and I will NEVER order online from Costco again.\nNote:  The associate never even offered an apology but would only say "The system is automated".\nJim
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Always good choices for wine, meat, chicken, and anything for the home. Isn't crowded at all and the prices here in Arizona are great!  I am a big big fan!!
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	It's hard to hate on Costco.  I mean, what's not to love?  They've got quality products, they treat their employees well, you can save a lot in the long run when shopping there, and if you're ever broke one week, just swing by and live off of samples.\n\nIn my book, Costco (in general) gets five stars.  The problem I have is with THIS particular location.  Specifically, prices.  I don't know what it is about THIS particular Costco, but for some reason their prices are often higher than those at other Costco locations in the valley.  The most glaring example to me was for a bottle of Glenlivet 12 scotch.  At every other Costco in town it's usually about $26; here, it's something like $32!  Yeah, it's only six bucks, but this is freaking COSTCO - saving money is the whole idea.  Plus, at that price, the bottle was more expensive there than at most local liquor stores.  That's just one example, and I've noticed higher prices at this location than at other local locations on various other items.  Frankly, I don't understand why one location would be more expensive than the others, but this one is.\n\nSave yourself some money and hit up the Costco on Elliot and Priest, or roll on up to Scottsdale.
o7WABjZct-u2gpBR8LXckQ	Staff is very nice and helpful. Great selection of bulk items like organic quinoa and ready to eat organic  brown rice (just microwave). The food store inside only accepts cash and the pizza is pretty good, but the sundaes are yummy and huge! !
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Franchement délicieux et le service est génial.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Great neighbourhood joint. We keep going back and back. I've had many things on the menu, and it's always good. Great service, great atmosphere and great food.\n\nThe veggie pulled pork sandwich is a dream. My favourite sandwich in the world. I get cravings for it, I go, and am never disappointed. Please note that I'm not a vegetarian, and still prefer the veggie option. It's just so good. Oh, and they'll serve it on corn tortillas if you want to switch it up sometime.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	i live for places like this and if there was one in my neighborhood I would go there every day. It's an eatery hidden inside a convenience store with a fresh, delicious, and inexpensive menu. Try the 'pulled porc' and you will not be disappointed. Downsides: seating is limited, wait times are long, and it's best to bring cash but the food is worth it. You're welcome.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Vegan bf came here to try out the faux pulled pork sandwich. He had to ask them to remake it to vegan without the mayo sauce since it had eggs. \n\nLooked amazing and huge portion but the cabbage was overpowering in vinegar. The faux pork was very good in flavour and had a lot of bbq sauce. There was nothing else to it though.. not worth the $9 to it. \n\nOverall, cute shop, hippie ambiance, good flavour of the meat but not the other ingredients and no sides considering how much you pay.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Amazing faux pulled pork. Sweet and tucked away and cheap but high quality food and don't tell but they totally have $1.25 bottomless drip coffee. If they only had more seating I'd bring 10 friends at once! But you're right in the dep, which is equal parts of charming and annoying.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Wow! Everything was fantastic--it may be an off-beat location, but definitely worth the effort.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Overall I'd say this place is a-ok, but its atmosphere and non-food offerings make it quirky and definitely enjoyable! It seems to be a local lunchtime favorite as nearly all of the tables were full. Luckily, I managed to grab a window seat while waiting for my food to come out.\n\nI ordered a cappuccino and the pulled pork sandwich. The cappuccino was perfect and came in this beautiful red cup that I really wanted to steal and take back to put in my own apartment. The flavors were bold and strong but not too overpowering or acidic, and it went down so smoothly. I thought the pulled pork sandwich was just okay and nothing too special. Maybe it was a bit too sweet for my taste, as I like my pulled pork to be focused more on the natural flavors of the meat.\n\nAfter eating, I browsed their shelves which held some relics related to all things arts and culture, and I picked up a zine for $2.50 which detailed why you should start a band. I thought it was lovely that the authors decided to address specifically queer and POC female participation in a typically sexist band culture and why it's important to have them represented. It was also funny and carried a sense of honesty that can't be forced. I'll come back to explore their selection of SXSW and other music festival-related goodies next time!
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	OMG, heaven in earth !\n\nQuelle bonne idée d'être venu ici avant d'aller voir du tennis au parc Jarry.\nLa bouffe est trop bonne et je me suis fait péter le bide pour passer tranquillement l'après midi :)\nMon club sandwich était tellement bon avec le poulet mariné, la sauce relevée, etc ... Les patates commandées en plus étaient bien cuites et fondantes, assaisonnées parfaitement.\nJ'ai goûté le burger végé et c'était vraiment bon, au top des burgers végé que j'ai pu goûter !\nConcernant les desserts nous avons pris les pâtisseries vendus et c'était vraiment bon. Les biscuits et le carré au citron étaient parfaits pour finir le repas !\nAu final on s'en est tiré pour 35$ à 2 (tx et tips) et on a très bien mangé, que cela soit d'un point de vue qualitatif ou quantitatif.\n\nUne expérience à renouveler très rapidement pour tester les autres plats dont le sous marin au boeuf qui me faisait sérieusement de l'oeil !
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	This gem has now become widely known in Montreal. But despite being more mainstream, they have definitely kept their hipster roots. This is a perfect place to grab a sandwich to go or enjoy it on their terrace on a summers day. I highly recommend the grilled halloumi cheese sandwich as well as the vege pulled pork. Both are unique and spectacular. Also notable are their baked goods and homemade lemonade.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Best pulled pork in the city, hands down - including the vegetarian version, which is delicious! They also make a fantastic iced coffee and have a super charming little patio in the back, which is the perfect place to spend a sunny Saturday morning. The kind of amazing in-between place that makes me adore Montreal. Just don't all go swarming the place, because this is my favourite neighbourhood spot!
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Il faut sortir des sentiers battus pour se rendre au Pick-Up... et, puis, attention : on cligne des yeux et hop!, on passe devant ; ni vu, ni connu. \n\nAlors ma recommandation : gardez les yeux ouverts !  \n\nLe Pick-Up est un charmant petit resto, café ET dépanneur... un genre d'enfant illégitime (mais ô combien adorable !) résultant d'un ménage à trois entre un diner, un truck-stop et une quincaillerie de quartier.  On y trouve de tout ; du petit paquet de serviettes hygiéniques, aux lettres et numéros adhésifs à apposer sur sa porte d'entrée, en passant par le carton de jus d'orange, et sans oublier le sandwich au fromage haloum grillé !\n\nGénial petit endroit sans prétention, bien sympa et chaleureux.  On y va pour se dépanner, pour emporter, pour y luncher ou pour y prendre un café avec sa p'tite gang... ou on opte pour la livraison à la maison.\n\nJ'ai découvert cet endroit - un premier étage de duplex dans le Mile-Ex, au coin de Waverly et Beaumont - grâce à des amis il y a presque un an maintenant et j'y retourne régulièrement pour manger un bon sandwich au comptoir ou assise à une des deux tables à l'intérieur.  \n\nCertains raffolent de leurs petits déjeuners et de leurs petits gâteaux...  Je ne les ai encore jamais essayés.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Un petit endroit qui n'a pas d'allure, mais qui est super bon, les gens sont accueillants. Rien à redire
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	FAUX PULLED PORK SANDWICH: The bun/bread is good, as are the slaw and pickles. I actually haven't had a pulled pork sandwich since becoming vegan or vegetarian and I'm not sure when the last time I had one when I did eat meat, so although it's been years, I honestly was so surprised by the quality of the faux meat! It's definitely a personal choice, but I'd rather eat just veggies than spongey/tasteless meat alternatives. \nNote: Order without mayo if vegan. I'm vegan and it's still Very good. Well, I didn't think it was missing the mayo because the BBQ sauce is good.\nCan't remember the price exactly but it was about $8CAD. And the sandwich was pretty big, I saved half for my next meal!\n\nCOFFEE/ESPRESSO: I've gotten coffee and espresso here on many separate occasions, and they were always really good. I heard that a couple of the people there work at those high end, chemist-style coffee places, which I know doesn't necessarily mean it's good here but it's a fun fact anyway. \nAgain, don't remember the price but it's like normal not over priced, about $2CAD per drink. \n\nTHE PLACE: It's still a depanneur, so definitely expect that sort of place. There's seating at the counter right where you pay but there's also a bunch of tables out back. It's super casual but don't let that trick you into thinking all depanneur's have as good as food - they don't. This is quite literally a diamond in the rough (well, not literally obviously).\n\nSidenote: The desserts look amazing (different cookies and pastries, etc.). I haven't tried any because they probably all contain eggs or dairy, but I've seen many a people gush over the chocolate chip cookies and this vanilla pastry that they have. Try one for me.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	This little unassuming neighbourhood spot serves some great sandwiches! They are a small little grocery shop with limited indoor seating and a patio. The sandwiches areade to order and they're busy. The orders kept coming in while I was waiting for mine and it wasn't even during peak hours. The halloumi was good; loved the squeaky cheese and the flavors. Hubby had the steak and said it was great.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	This place is a neighbourhood staple. Do yourself a favour and eat the veggie pulled pork sandwich.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Love it. This is a depanneur in the mile ex area that doubles up as a restaurant but I think most people come for the food. I've ordered from both their breakfast and lunch menus. Never been disappointed. Service is always excellent and unassuming. As for the food, I love their beef burgers, chipotle club, potatoes and quinoa salad. There is a daily menu that varies from day to day. They also have amazing lattes and desserts. This place tends to get busy during meal times so be prepared to wait or to order for takeout.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Just wanted to say thank you for having a booth set up at Osheaga. A place where apparently not eating meat is the hugest imposition ever.  I couldnt do another pizza cone or overpiced dagwood sandwich by the third day and you guys saved me. The vegetarian pulled pork was my first time trying fake pulled pork but it was great. I dug the extra stringy/chewy texture since most fake meat isn't as "hearty." The bun and dressings also added a nice presentation to it. It felt like I was eating a super manly and substantial sandwich, which is not often something you get when ordering vegetarian sandwiches. (see: every place that has a "vegetarian" option which means scattered un-seasoned roasted vegetables on a piece of bread.)
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Un peu déçue par mon sub steak qui était assez petit, pas spécialement bon ou mauvais et assez caoutchouteux. Bref ça ne valait sûrement pas 9$. À 5$ je n'aurais rien dit. Sinon le service était courtois, et la place possède un certain cachet (hipster alert!)
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Excellent petit endroit qu'il faut absolument connaître! C'est le genre de place qu'on découvre par bouche à oreille, car il est dans un bout de quartier un peu moins fréquenté (Mile Ex). \n\nLeurs sandwichs au pulled pork font leur réputation, mais les autres sortes sont également excellentes. Le sandwich au poisson (pas toujours au menu) est fantastique!\n\nSi vous y aller en semaine le midi, surtout le jeudi et le vendredi, attendez-vous à patienter un petit bout en ligne. Le Pick-Up est vraiment populaire, surtout auprès des bureaux d'architectes et de web voisins! \n\nSi vous habitez le quartier, le Pick-Up est un excellent endroit où aller déjeuner rapidos, assis au " bar " à regarder le cook travailler. Leurs déjeuners sont simples mais bons. \n\nIl ne faut pas oublier non plus que c'est un dépanneur, donc ils vendent bières, cigarettes et un peu de bouffe pour dépanner. Et ils ont une excellente sélection de zines!\n\nSeul hic... Il ne prenne pas la carte, ce qui est vraiment dommage!
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Go with a friend. Split the veggie pulled pork sandwich (VPP) and the halloumi sandwich, so you can try both and throw in a side of potatoes. \n\nAll their baked goods on display at the counter are delicious. I wouldn't know - I've never eaten them. Just saw "someone else" eat a lemon square one time and then a chocolate chip cookie another time, and look super happy with life. I am pretty sure it was "someone else".\n\nConsistently delicious. Casual vibe (it's part of a dep) and off the beaten path - full of local Montrealers. It has a small seating area (maybe 3 tables) and the bar inside, and in the summer there are picnic benches outside.\nClose to the Jean Talon market if you're in the hood.\n\nThis is one of those places I hope never changes.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	I loved the green salad (misnomer - lots of color), the Chipotle Club Sandwich - substantial and tasty. I tasted 4 of the sweets all yum! As much a treat as the handsome young man serving was to my eyes. My friend had the Steak sub and enjoyed it immensely. I bought a Tom Green Milk beer and McKeon Sparkling Cranberry Cider (to be savoured likely this weekend) .\n\nEnjoyed the curios which had me flashing back to my childhood and the contrast of gourmet gourmande vibe of the micro brews & assortment of organic eatz & drinks.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Ce petit dépanneur, au milieu de nul part dans Little Italie, ne paye pas de mine mais le concept est vraiment chouette ! On peut y acheter un paquet de chips et même y casser la croute. C'est bon, très convivial et le staff est plutôt accueillant. \n\nUne place atypique pour prendre un petit déjeuner / brunch à Montréal, que je recommande fortement ! \n\nNote : pour les lève-tard, le petit déjeuner n'est servi que jusqu'à 11:30AM
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Le Pick Up (a very artsy deps in Montreal) is my target for lunch today! Well-received Faux (veggie "porc") pulled pork is a must-eat here! Awesome! I have never eaten a vegetarian pull pork, replacing pork with chinese vegetarian bean-curd to allow for the shredding pulled pork texture! Then topped with tangy and spicy sauce, caraway seeds, pepper, preserved pickle, sweet chili, jalapeño, caramelized onions, vinegary slaw stuffed high between 2 slices of chewy bun! It's a mammoth, my $6.75 was well spent! \n\nService is prompt but expect to wait for 15 minutes to get your items whipped up on a weekend. They even send us a bottle of ice water with clean cups while waiting at the empty communal table, so thoughtful! I guess the heat wave is driving me crazy these days in Montreal but nothing beats this crazier yummy creation by Le Pick-up.\n\nThe inner space is a little cramped but the patio has a couple of dining tables and seats as well as in the "secret garden" at the backyard. I saw a stairway leading to a second level which I do not know if another dining hall exist? The place is just full of artsy vibes!!!!  \n\nIf you are looking to get some cookies, condiments, canned items, they have a few on the shelve, I am seeing my fave maple cookies that I almost sweep it into my bag! I now figured why they are called dépanneur, because they started out as a convenient store! Cool!!
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	A breakfast and lunch place that's closed on Sundays? I get the reasoning but it still sucks.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Are you a vegetarian? Do you like delicious sandwiches? Of course you do. \nGo here. Eat all the sandwiches. \nVeggie pulled pork. Grilled Halloum. Breakfast sandwich with veggie ham.\nI'm sure it's delicious if you're a meat eater too, but I don't care about that.\n\nBonuses - cute atmosphere. lovely staff. also a dep, for all your snack/beer/minor household needs.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Co-owned by Bernadette Houde aka Bernie Bankrupt of the seminal Montreal electro act Lesbians on Ecstasy and Penny Patterson, this chill corner store / diner seats about 30 in the summer and 8 in the winter, serves what is perhaps the world's best veggie pulled pork, stocks a great selection of organic snacks and hand-stapled zines, and continuously reinvents itself as a multi-purpose art experience. Featured in New York Times T Magazine - http://tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/03/pulled-pork-and-performance-art-in-montreal/
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	J'adore cette place ! \nUn peu planqué mais il vaut le détour. Le Pick-Up est placé dangereusement sur mon chemin pour aller au marché Jean Talon. Les sandwichs sont bons et l'ambiance est bonne. \nC'est simple et efficace.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	The sandwiches are delicious... Really delicious! Beware, the crowds are very eclectic... Beyond your usual hipster. Nice vibe and super friendly service. Parking is a little difficult. Enjoy!
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Awesome food from a converted retro dep hidden away in a quiet side street near Little Italy. Vegetarian pulled pork sandwich is sublime. Staff are super friendly and interesting.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Great sandwiches. Good music for a Saturday morning.Cool neighbourhood joint.\nThey were there from the very beginning.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Right in the heart of the "cool" of Montreal this famous sandwich joint is a absolutely must try. I'm not into trying things for name sake, but this place really does thing right. The vibe they own, it's not fake and the food really is amazing and fits perfectly. This is real Montreal. I have had a few diffrent things from drinks to sanwiches and dessert and everytime I enjoyed it.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	I randomly bixied by Dépanneur le Pick-Up when I was cruising around the area but for some reason didn't stop to check it out. Lucky, I was back in the Mile Ex area a few days later and stopped this time to check it out. It's location is somewhat hidden in a quiet residential area.\n\nHours are decent. Weekdays are 7:00am - 7:00pm and Saturday 9:00am - 6:00pm.\n\nNothing like grafitti on your sign to give it a cool grunge look. Candice wuz hee.\n\nLove the old school diner menu. It's almost a throwback to back in the day diner prices. Couple drink options. Cool that there's also a little grocery market inside.Their pastries looked pretty decadent, especially that lemon square.\n\nMatching diner booths and decor to solidify the old school look. Ventured outside while I waited for my grilled sandwich to be made. Love how there's two-seaters to sit at right along the sidewalk. Only in Montreal.\n\n- Haloum grillé ($8.00) - grilled haloumi with mint coleslaw. Everything is made to order here and you can tell. The sandwich was bomb. Best vegetarian sandwich I've had. Bread was grilled perfect; crispy, golden, buttery goodness.\n\nA huge slab of haloumi cheese awaits inside. The texture of haloumi is satisfying and grilling it made it even more so. The inside is packed with ingredients; red and white cabbage, carrots, onion but the game changer here was the mint. Gave it such a refreshingly cool after taste.\n\nThis is the spot if you want a cheap, delicious made to order grilled sandwich. A depanneur and diner all in one combo.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	I love this place! I have eaten here many times and have tried almost all of their menu items (it is not extensive). I fell in love with the ambiance and the food. The restaurant is in a corner store just off of Jean Talon - it's kind of like walking into a mum & pop Depanneur from the 70s. The pulled pork is fantastic but my favourite is their Grilled Haloum sandwich.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	There is nothing like the pick up. Nothing. Go there. Now. Eat everything. \n\nBest drip coffee ever. I live nearby specifically to eat here more. I bring all my friends and out of town guests here. I always make a bet "if you don't love it, I'll pay" -- I've never lost.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Dépanneur le Pick-Up is one of my favorite places in Montreal of all times for so many reasons, part of those reasons being that there's no other place like it in the city. It's located on a quiet residential street and attracts literally every single type of person from hipster to gangster and everything in between. \n\nIt's a cross between a good old dep and a diner, with a zine rack and an array of weird knick-knacks.  The coffee is really good and so is the food. Also, le Pick-Up takes the cake for best pulled-pork sandwich I've ever tasted. Worldwide. Yep.\n\n**It's always packed so be prepared to wait for your food. Lots of outdoor seating in the summer time so you can enjoy a coffee while you wait.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	You know how heroin addicts always need their next fix? Well, I kind of feel that way about Le Pick-Up's faux pulled "porc". It is seriously the most glorious thing sandwiched between two buns. I am actually salivating as I write this and cannot wait until the next time I sink my teeth into it's edible deliciousness. The best part is that it's not tofu that they use but jack fruit for their "porc". Where they find jackfruit, I'm not sure. One day I will take the time out of my day to find out but for now I depend on Le Pick-Up for my fixture. \n\nThe staff is always friendly and they have fridges full of cool drinks like Curiosity Cola and what not. I like Boylan's Ginger Ale which they keep in stock. I could shower in it.\n\nThere are other sandwiches as well, but unfortunately I know nothing about them so its for you to find out. One of my friends swears by their tuna sandwiches and it runs out fast so best go early if you wanna dig into this fish sandwich.\n\nSide note: A lot of people think the faux pulled "porc" is vegan but there is mayo in this sandwich so its best to skip the sauce if you wanna keep it "ethical" for all you vegans out there.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Best place in the world. The food is ridiculous. Unique and delicious. \nIf you like sweets get the lemon square\nThere's a super cute terrasse out back\nAlthough tables are a little hard to come by as it gets pretty busy\nStaff is great, food is great, definitely one of my favourite spots to eat
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Super petite place de quartier. La bouffe est bonne et très conviviale. J'ai pris le sandwich au pulled pork végé ( oui, oui!) et c'était vraiment délicieux! On y trouve de charmants produits locaux comme les conserves de Preservation Society et d'autres produits plus funky comme de la boisson au Kombucha ou de la sauce piquante! J'aime leurs tables à pique-nique extérieurs où l'on peut relaxer sans soucis au soleil!\nChouette Dép!
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	The pulled pork sandwich is awesome. I've tried a couple of pulled pork sandwiches all over the US and surprisingly, this place takes the cake. Well balanced with pickles, mayo, pickled banana peppers and cole slaw...crunchy yet airy bread...It was great. The Pick-Up also sells a small variety of ginger beers, which was a big plus for me / a wonderful surprise. If you're in this neighborhood, you MUST try it out. Plus this place is a stone's throw from Jean Talon market, I recommend visiting both in a single outing.\n\nPrice: $7.50
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	My mechanic suggests I wait the hour at "a cool dep/café down the street". Dubious about what "cool" means to him.... \nWell Hello Dolly!!!  Hello Twilight Zone Pit-stop Heaven!  Vintage dépanneur with diner counter & sweet terrace. Understated, wholesome neighbourhood secret sweet spot. Good people, doing good things, in a great way.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Le Pick-Up un dépanneur? Oui, on peut dire ça. Un snack-bar? On peut dire ça aussi. Quoi d'autre? Un repère à hipster? Un endroit atypique? Un restaurant inclassable? Une cuisine surprenante? Oui.. on peut dire tout ça aussi du dépanneur le Pick-Up. \n\nIl s'agit donc d'un comptoir restaurant situé à l'intérieur d'un bon vieux dépanneur de quartier. Si le concept peut surprendre, on oublie souvent que ce drôle de mélange était très courant dans les quartiers ouvriers des grandes villes du Québec. On y venait pour casser la croute à midi, et pour y faire ses courses à fin du "shift" de travail. C'est donc ce concept rétro qui est conservé ici dans toute sa simplicité. \n\nEn gros, je dirais que la cuisine du Pick-up est surprenante et inventive. J'ai mangé un sandwich au fromage haloum grillé avec salade de choux. Très bon. On dit de l'endroit que la spécialité est le sandwich Pulled-Pork, alors je me promets d'y revenir pour y gouter. Un dernier mot sur l'ambiance atypique. Lors de mon passage ici, un groupe électro-underground jouait en sourdine, ce qui ajoutait à l'atmosphère très hipster de l'endroit. J'adore. \n\nÀ visiter absolument.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Came on suggestion from a veggie friend who used to live in the area. The veggie pulled pork was incredible. It is  made of  seitan and it is absolutely delicious. One of the best veggie sandwiches I have ever had. Also had the halloumi which was also perfect. Wish I lived in Montreal.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	As long as you don't mind feeling like the hipster you know you are, dear Yelp reader, this place is awesome. \n\nWe were staying in the old town and Ubered out to this place for lunch because we had heard good things. It was well worth it. Awesome pulled pork sandwich, awesome hallumi sandwich, awesome lemonade and pleasant seats outside. \n\nLots of talk at the table next to us about getting some "studio time" to "lay down some tracks", so in addition to having really good sandwiches, Le Pickup must also be really cool.\n\nPS, there's a bike station right next to the shop.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Les sandwichs sont vraiment bons. On ne s'attend pas a manger de telles choses dans un dépanneur sans prétention du Mile-End. \nL'attente a été très longue malheureusement. Cela ne m'a pas donné envie d'y retourner.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Lunchtime might be busy here but I enjoy the hustle and bustle of sitting at the counter and chatting with the chef while watching my food being made. Once you're a regular here, you'll get treated like family. Try the powermade in the summer: a delicious homemade hibicus iced tea, or try one of the best iced coffees in town (add your own sugar and milk! tasty espresso! ) During the week, if Michael made the soup of the day, always order it, he's amazing at it. Best breakfast sandwich ever: your choice of ham, bacon, cheddar or veggie ham, a fried egg, your choice of bread (including corn tortillas) lettuce, tomato, mayo- but they'll always let you add things for a few extra cents (i say do bacon AND cheddar, make the mayo chipotle and add hot peppers). This place is loud but friendly- if you're in town and you don't know anybody, here are some very sweet and funny people who will make you feel like you're among friends.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	This is Le Pick Up's claim to fame. Slow roasted pulled pork sandwich in barbecue sauce, served with grilled peppers, coleslaw on a Portuguese style bun. REALLY tasty. Straight up. There was a certain zing to the barbecue sauce and it was complimented perfectly with the crunchy slaw directly in the sandwich. All it was missing was fries and they could have called it a "Po'Garçon".
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Unique spot with a big patio and friendly staff. I've been here twice for the daily sandwich specials during the busy lunch rush and will definitely come back. I'd add a star if the sandwiches were $1-2 less, or if you got a side with them.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	On my first day in Montreal, having done my research, I dragged my resident friend to Le Pick Up.\n\nOh. My. Goodness.\nAdmittedly, I've been a vegetarian for most of my life and as such have never eaten pulled pork before. I'm not really sure what it's supposed to taste like, but if it tastes anything like the incredible faux pulled porc I had here, then I certainly understand the hype. It was so sweet, sour, tangy and spicy. Amazing flavours and perfect crusty bread at a good price. Not to mention, babely eye candy behind the counter taking your order and serving up the goods. The tables outside are a lovely addition to this kitschy neighbourhood deps.\n\nI will definitely be back here before my trip to Montreal is over.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	C'est un endroit que je fréquente sur une base régulière! Je m'y suis donc rendu pour le brunch samedi dernier! La bouffe était excellente comme d'habitude. C'est plutôt l'ambiance qui m'a surpris... charmé même! Du Jacques Brel à fond, rien de surprenant pour quelqu'un qui a connu les cafés du Plateau dans les années 90. Mais le choix des pièces étaient surprenantes, sans parler du staff toujours aussi coloré! Je me suis retrouvé dans cette ambiance anachronique dans un environnement, plus que Montréalais! Le Dépanneur Pick-Up est définitivement un incontournable!
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Un endroit qui réunit à la fois mon côté végétalien et carnivore.\n\nLe sandwich halloumi/salade de chou/menthe,/mayonnaise au chipotle/miel m'a fait craquer. J'ai aussi craqué pour. l'VPP (végétarien pulled pork) sandwich. J'aime bien le café ici est incroyable L'été, il faut absolument goûter au "Powermade" une bière maison de thé glacé composée approximativement d'hibiscus, de cannelle et de citron
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	We came here for lunch. I got the veggie pulled 'porc' and my friend got the sous-marin steak sub. Both of the sandwiches were super delicious. The pulled porc sandwich was sweet, tangy, spicy and oh so good! The steak sub looked really good too. Liked the ambiance and enjoyed watching the chef serve up sandwiches as we ate
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Hells yes to the faux pulled pork sandwich! The only real issue with being a vegetarian is that I always feel left out while my friends have a big meaty paw of a sandwich and I am stuck with what looks like cat food from a tin can smooshed between two lame pieces of bread. Thanks to Le Pick-Up, I too can now have a huge 'meaty' sandwich in my paw! The chipotle mayo and banana peppers provided a nice kick and the bread was perfection: toasted and delicious. My meat-eating lunch mate couldn't get over the texture of the tofu, said it was exactly like real porc. The staff here are friendly and fun, the tunes were cranked and we scored a picnic table right by the door. I love this place! Bonus: the cookies and lemon bars are divine and they have a huge range of condoms available...why? Who knows, but hey, you can never be too careful!
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Went today for lunch after hearing very good reviews from friends. It did not disappoint. I had the special which was a lemongrass beef sandwich with Kim-chi. It was so good! my friend had the pulled pork that looked really awesome. Although, I've REALLY thirsty ever since. \n\nThe atmosphere is very laid-back casual but clean. Waiters were great. Very friendly and checking up with us often to make sure everything was good.\n\nI will definitely go back again.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Yum, stop by this place to pick up some delicious pulled pork sandwiches on your way to/from the market.  So good.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	one of the best casual brunches out there. delicious, cheap, friendly and fun. they're happy to turn anything veggie or vegan if you ask, but the pulled pork is famous. \nlove the sunny terrace!
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Tried the burger, steak sous marine & pulled pork!!! All very delicious. Cookies are to die for
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	I love this place, it's a warm place to sit and have a nice link here, they serve brunch also. I always take the pulled pork sandwich. They serve up some pretty decent burgers and subs also.\n\nI have this a high grade because of the people that work there.. Very friendly. They strive to make you feel welcome. \nI actually can't wait to go back
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	A classic of the Mile-end, let us hope that they continue to serve pulled pork in unpretentious surroundings well into the future.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Great rad diner with vegan and vegetarian options. The fake pulled pork sandwich is my favorite. Awesome old school diner breakfasts with some zines on the side. Nice patio during summer. A real Mile Ex staple.
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Ici chaque plat à une saveur bien à lui. Ne pas oublier de goûter au sandwich de porc effiloché. C'est également le point de rencontre de tous les hipsters de la ville semble-t-il. Les prix sont raisonnables le décor est nul mais on peut y manger à l'extérieur
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Wonderful.  I was enchanted at once the first time I walked in here upon sight of the inexplicable gigantic toothbrush.  This is in fact a depanneur, but they have a sweet little kitchen to pump out delicious meaty (or not) savory meals.  Upon sampling every sandwich on the menu (not in the first visit) I'd have to say that the winner is a tie between the Club Chipotle (club sandwich with chipotle sauce) and the Post-Reveillon (turkey and cranberry!).  Of the two times I had the pulled pork, it unfortunately varied.  My first was not nearly moist and flavorful as it should have been, yet the second time (when Beaver was in the kitchen) it was deeeelicious and perfect.  My plate was a mess and I licked it clean.  In public.\n\nI have as of yet to try the soups nor the salads, but I surely will sometime soon.\n\nA solid place for cheap and filling eats to show your out of town friends a little slice of Trouvé-seulement-à-Montréal" dining or just to meet up with local friends for a delightful bite.  Nice and hidden so the dummies from McGill can't find it as it's located outside of the McGill "Ghetto."
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Delish delish delish! Have tried just about everything from sandwichs, salad and potatoes to desserts! Fresh and never boring! Friendly staff and due to popularity be patient as worth the wait!
i5j3FrxdR224KIjfv8x2CQ	Very cute/cool place.  I was at Stade Uniprix for tennis (Rogers Cup) and instead of eating there, we decided to take a short walk to find some REAL food.  So glad we did!  We would've never come here otherwise!  \n\nDelicious sandwiches for under ten bucks.  We tried the special of the day (Cuban), the pulled pork, and the steak sub.  Yummy!!!\n\nLots of seating outside so hang out for awhile.  Do expect to wait a bit for your food as it is being prepared to order.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	The best & friendliest little market that you will find in Zona... And the sandwiches are uber delish!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Been coming here for years!\n\nThe people who own it are great! They are friendly, happy and run a incredible operation. They always take care to greet you by name and ask how you are doing. I have never had a bad experience there and the only time something went slightly wrong it resulted in me having a new favorite sandwich. Speaking of the sandwiches they are incredible!\n\nThis place is great! Props to Al, Marty and Sam for running such a great place!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Went here for the first time tonight. Very cool place and the guy who helped me out was very nice. Great sandwich and didn't break the bank for something healthier than fast food. Will be back since the food was good and really nice people.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Great sandwiches! Fresh! Made to order. Love this place. My daughter loves the sandwiches too!  The owners are very nice people.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	This place if GREAT!  We moved her from California last year and it's the only place we will get our sandwiches! !  Always fresh and friendly service!  Yum!!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Best sandwiches around (Boars Head meat) and fresh baked sub rolls!  Beer selection is second only to BevMo.  Always treated like family when im there.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	People are friendly, breakfast and lunch sandwiches are over the top crazy good! Get the breakfast croissant. They have a great wine selection as well! A must try!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Not only do these guys have the best subs but they know everyone by name and what they usually buy. And they can usually have me rung up by the time I make it to the register. I love these guys! I
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Awesome deli, fresh baked bread, great beer selection, super friendly staff, glad to have these guys in the neighborhood.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	As it was mentioned in a previous review, this place IS basically a convenience store with sandwich makers standing by.  So pretty much take a 7/11 or a comparable "kwike mart" that is over crowded with run of the mill convenience products and stick a deli case in it with a modest display of only Boars Head products (as if Boars Head is the end-all/be-all of gourmet deli) put a menu above it with typical selections of sandwiches and salads and there you have Convenient Corner Market.  The prices are in the middle.  The quality of my sandwiches was good but not uniquely good.  If you are planning a visit, I'd suggest calling ahead to avoid waiting longer than one would expect while dodging people just trying to buy some smokes, a tall boy, and a scratcher\n+'s:  fresh tasting bread, family owned and operated, somewhat decent selection of beer/wine\n-'s:  limited selection, long wait, could be cheaper, just "ok" sandwiches
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	I have been coming here for over 15 years. It's just keeps getting better thanks Alvin and Marty. The sandwiches are great everyone is friendly and it's on a pretty convenient corner.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	This place is amazing!!! \nFriendly staff! Best egg sandwich I have ever had!!!\nThis is a must try!!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	This little gem is a new favorite of ours. We are new to the neighborhood and we love stopping in here for lunch or to grab something quick that we forgot to buy at the grocery store. The staff are always friendly and greet you promptly when you walk in. They even know most customers by name. The sandwiches are a great value and you never have to wait long for them to be made. Great business-- we have been and will continue to be repeat customers.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Best sandwiches and service in scottsdale. I love the owner and his employees. Real family place and their food is the best. Cheap too!  Go there if you want an awesome Rueben or Italian sandwich and their breakfast sandwiches are to die for. Love this place!!!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Convenient including basic's from condiments ,greeting cards, lottery .e.t.c... Primo deli severd with lots of luv & laughter. :)
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Awesome sandwiches on the best subroll ever!  Don't miss out!   Always friendly & nice!  I was raised in Scottsdale and I unfortunately don't live in the neighborhood, however, when I'm driving out to visit family, I always stop by for a sammy and a few extra rolls to go!  Thank you!!!  Keep up the great food & service!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Best sandwiches I've had in AZ so far. Everything is super fresh, prices are low. Seems like a convenience store but really more of a deli/grocery. Cute place and very welcoming. I just moved to the area and will be there a lot more!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	I work in this same shopping center. I needed lunch and my coworker directed me toward the convenience store like "No, trust me." I was skeptical, but they were right. High-quality meats, large portions, cheap prices. Marty also has amazing recall and greets me every time I come in. \n\nBeer selection is pretty good as well, given the size of the deli (although my nearby job is with students so the beer is for *after* work...).
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Sandy's are bomb and staff is friendly! My fave is the Italian with pepper jack cheese!\nSo happy I live so close to this spot!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Freshest of meats and bread. Selection is that of a high class restaurant. Probably the best Italian sub in town. You can get anything else you need from the nicest group of owners and staff you'll ever meet. Forget the bargain meals, this place is the real deal.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Best local convenience store in the valley! If you live in North Scottsdale, this should be your go-to place. Run by a family from Detroit, this store is one of those old-school places where everybody knows everyone's names; even when I don't go so often, they still remember my name at the counter! Tell me.... is there any other convenience store where they actually know your name when you walk in??? no. there is only one place, and this is it. The service here is absolutely amazing - you will walk out every single time with a smile on your face. I actually look forward to going there sometimes, if only to get a soda or lottery ticket, just because of the friendly ambiance. Now to more important things: the sandwiches. You would never expect this place, based on the outside appearance, to have one of the very best delis in town. They have a rather large sandwich menu, and use only Boar's Head meats and cheeses. Best part - they bake their own bread daily and omg it is so good! Their breakfast croissants are amongst the best I have ever had (so flakey and buttery!) and their sub rolls are just excellent. Sometimes I stop by to just get some sub rolls, if I have leftovers at home to make sammys with. The three sandwiches I recommend the most are the: beefstrami (hot beef and pastrami melt, mmmm), chicken Caesar (it's light and refreshing), and my personal fav - The Shane Doan. Named after the legendary Phoenix Coyotes captain, who is a regular at the store (he often stops by with Mike Smith and Kurt Warner even!), the sandwich that bears his name used to be "the upside down roast beef"... basically a beef melt. I always add a piece of cheese to it, and I love how they prepare it and top it with fresh green pepper and mustard. It really is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. \nI can't recommend this store enough - and that is solely based on the owners, as people and as businessmen - they really nailed it when it comes to neighbourhood convenience. Go for a sandwich and I guarantee you will be hooked.\nTell them Istvan sent you and say hi to Marty for me!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	These guys rock!! Best deli sandwiches ever. The creamy basil pasta salad is excellent. Wonderful friendly staff who gets to know you as you frequent the store. Decently priced on everything. Wish I lived closer and they made special lunch deliveries to Amber in Tempe :)
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	This place is a hidden gem!  What an incredibly delicious menu they have for amazing prices!  You can get a half sandwich (which is huge), side, chips, and a drink for about $6.50.  I highly recommend the Turkey Delight and macaroni salad, they're both great.  The food and the staff are the absolute best things about this place.  This place is family owned and operated by the most amazing and friendly family.  If you go in often enough, they will recognize you.  I know there are plenty of regulars because they will greet lots of people by name.  I've been going to this place whenever I can for about 7 years, even when I lived out of town, I would always try to stop by here for lunch if I could when visiting.  The only thing I wish they had was some outdoor seating under their covered entryway during the cool times of the year.  There's a very small seating area inside, but I think most customers take out anyways (I usually do), so it's really no big deal.  I will never stop going to this place, I love the people and the food, maybe in that order!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Sandwiches are really good and the staff is friendly. Everyone in the neighborhood loves these guys for a reason. This is what customer service should be like.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	This is the spot! Friendly neighborhood market. Been coming here for over ten years. It's family owned and ran with love and professionalism. I get greeted by first name every time I enter the store. Basically all the daily needs are sold here and as a bonus they have the best sandwiches around.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	First time! I really liked this place! The service was great and the sammich was solid. I ordered the Italian to go with the mac salad, chips and a soda. I thought it was a great deal. Next time I will have the dude church up my sammich to include some hot peppers maybe but overall I am super impressed!  It was made exactly as described on the menu. I strolled the store while I waited and it has a really nice selection. Its what I would call a party store I guess. I will definitely be back.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	I've been coming here since I moved here three years ago. By far the best sandwiches in town, no question! Reasonably priced, fresh and locally owned! What more can you ask for? They also have punch cards for frequent customers ;)
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	I've been a regular at this market for about 4 years.  They have the best sandwiches in the area, high quality and right-priced.  In my opinion, they beat, not only in taste, but value against ALL their competitors.\n\nEveryone that works there is super friendly.  Its not uncommon to see neighbors in there, and somehow they keep all of our names straight :).
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	I love this market. We come in here all the time for sodas and sandwiches. I wish they had a few more items on the shelves, but love the service.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Great food at great prices!  Family owned, bread cooked on premises and Boars Head Provisions!  You can't go wrong at either of their two locations!  We get breakfast sandwiches their every weekend!  You won't be disappointed!!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Best Sandwich hands down...we moved from AZ  to NYC and all the Delis there left us missing Convenient  Corner Market...we are back home in AZ and  couldn't wait to get a sandwich made with your fresh bread!!!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	This is my boyfriend's favorite deli and he has been going for quite some time. He used to live down the street and that is how he got familiar with this place. We don't live too far but don't frequent this place that often. \n\nLet me start with this - my boyfriend is from the east coast where they grew up eating hoagies. I grew up eating rice and all sorts of weird things. I wouldn't say I'm a sandwich/sub/hoagie connoisseur of any sorts but he is. The bread plays a major factor. This place does it right! \n\nIf you are in the neighborhood and you're in the mood for a quick/easy and delicious hoagie, this is your place. Bye, their macaroni salad is pretty good too!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Really love this store. Marty always greets me and my friends with a smile, and then hooks us up with some quality sandwiches. The sandwiches are fantastic, made quick, and the best part is the price of the sandwich combo which includes a bag of chips and a drink. The store also hires local students so it's nice to see familiar faces and catch up with them while my sandwich is being made. It's in such a great location too that it' never a hassle to go here for some food. I fully recommend this place to anybody who lives in Scottsdale, and even anyone just passing through town looking for a quick sandwich.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Love their ham and cheese sandwiches! We love stopping by for a quick lunch to go! YUMMY!!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	Was in the area and came across this little deli.  I had the deluxe sandwich and it was done perfectly. The bread was super fresh and they put in tons of meats and cheese. I thought the price was very reasonable. If I lived closer this would definitely be my go to sandwich deli.
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	May offer some of the best subs in town...fresh and delicious! Love their sub rolls, they were soft but had a nice crust. Very clean and well organized, you can tell they care about their business. Super nice & friendly people working behind the counters & making the sandwiches...the folks working seemed like family and you could tell they care about the business & product. Pretty refreshing to find a place like this nowadays! I wish I lived in this neighborhood...I'd eat & shop there everyday!
WRlcASYWlNYmMr9lHOYw1Q	I've been coming to this place for years and no matter how many sandwich shops pop up in the valley, I still always say that convenient corner makes the best sandwiches I have had. The boar's head meat is fantastic, the bread is delicious, everyone who works here is so incredibly friendly, and it's tucked away in a neighborhood so you don't get the annoying foot traffic or loud morons talking on their cell phones. Just an excellent sandwich. I'll be singing this place's praises for years to come.
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	The staff is friendly and there are some good deals at times. \n\nThe pharmacy is a little confusing, the staff in there doesn't seem to communicate well. I switched to a different birth control and they kept giving me the old perscription too until I pointed it out.\n\nRegular walgreens, has most everything you would want/need from a convenience store.
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	Literally the worst Walgreens I've ever dealt with. Pharmacy staff is ever-changing and consistently lazy. I've seen some pretty ridiculous interactions between  the pharmacists/techs and some shady people due to the area so I can somewhat understand them being a bit jaded, but that doesn't excuse their performance especially when it comes to us normal people who just happen to live close by and want to use a Walgreens for our prescriptions. I am looking into switching to CVS today.
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	CVS is so much better when it comes to filling prescriptions. This place takes longer. And they forget about you. CVS will call out your name, here its "Oh you are still waiting?" :-|\n\n\nPros - the app is great, Walgreens photo is amazing and helps my scrap bookign needs!\nAnd it has all of my girly necessities, from make up to shampoo, to lotion. Awesome.
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE HERE! I've used the pharmacy (drive through at night) and store during the day and both were excellent experiences. By accident I left an item behind in the store after a purchase and the employees, especially the manager and assistant managers, were all VERY helpful in keeping it safe for me until I was able to retrieve it.
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	I use this Walgreens solely for prescriptions, but I'm officially on the hunt for another pharmacy or switching to mail order.\n\nI don't find the staff particularly friendly at this location or particularly helpful. I had a problem with my insurance accepting my prescription once, and they didn't bother to tell me until I got there. \n\nBy far the worst part is the wait time. The drive thru is consistently a ridiculous wait. Out of the 8 times I've gone, only once did I wait less than 10 minutes. If you can't staff enough people to cover the drive thru, then just don't have one! Last night, I was the only car in the drive thru. The pharmacist said he would be with me in a few minutes. 10 minutes later, I was still waiting with no further or update or acknowledgement. I finally gave up and left and now have to make a second trip tonight.\n\nGoing inside doesn't really make it that much faster either. It's really a choice of do you want to wait in your car or stand in line in the store?
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	Its a drug store. It serves its purpose.
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	Very friendly staff that is always happy and willing to assist with any needs. Every time I visit as a frequent customer I'm treated with respect and kindness.
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	They hired this new guy at the front register and good god I would drive 10 miles out of my way to not get this guy. He calls the manager over the speaker every 2 minutes, has no knowledge of anything can't count change to save his life and he's a rude douche bag I have no idea why anyone could ever hire this guy. He will hold up a line for a good 20 minutes to get through 3 people so save yourself time and go to another Walgreens!
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	I go here to get my prescriptions filled and also to shop for cosmetics and stuff occasionally.  I've never had a problem with the pharmacy.  The drive thru line can take a while at times, so I try to go during the off-peak hours.  When I don't have to wait for other people in line I can drive up, get my prescription, and be done in less than 5 minutes.\n\nand sometimes they have treats for my dog!
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	5 STARS FOR CONVENIENT LOCATION & POLITE REGULAR STAFF. \n\n0 STARS FOR CRAP PHARMACY SERVICE & THEIR "ATTENTION" TO DETAIL\n\n* I have used this location for  3 y and 4 mos, but will never return\n* Since switching medication a yr ago, I've encountered many problems & delays\n* In late June, my doc wrote a Rx for 90 pills of an extended release pill\n* I picked up my Rx & brought it home only to realize it was not extended release\n* I phoned WGs and they said my doc didn't write it for extended release\n* I phoned my doctor on Friday 30 June but she doesn't work Fridays\n* So, I left an urgent Vmail with her nurse in order to obtain an extended release Rx\n* 3 hours later, WGs sent me an automated telephone call stating my Rx was ready\n* I returned & exchanged the 90 regular pills for extended release\n* 1 hour later, the nurse phoned & I told her it had already been taken care of\n* 3 days later, I open the bag only to realize that the new bottle of extended release has      \n        only 30 pills--not 90 pills\n* My (old) insurance ran out on Friday 30 June b/c I lost my job; WGs won't replace my 60\n        missing pills\n* My new insurance's co-pay for the SAME extended release 30 pills is $1,000 instead of $12\n*So, I now must purchase regular release pills, which doesn't work as well\n* I hate this pharmacy & will use Fry's, CVS, or Walmart from this point forward b/c I want \n        out of their system\n\nAs I try to better my life, this WGs pharmacy repeatedly makes it more difficult to do so. \n\nAdios!
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	The evening shift pharmacy manager is a jerk. They only had a partial quantity of my prescription available so he gave that to me and told me to come back when I was ready for the rest. I came back a week and a half later and he told me that I had to pay my extremely high co-pay again because I waited too long to come back. I told him that there was no time frame given or I would've come back for the rest already. He argued with me and said that he had informed me of that (LIAR!!!!!). \n\nHe refused to override the charge for a prescription that I'd already paid for. He told me if I had a problem I could call 1800-Walgreens. I did just that. I spoke with someone in customer service who said that someone would contact me within 48 hours. I received a call the next day saying that my prescription was ready and the fee was being waived. Jerk.
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	Patrick is a D bag. Couldn't have been more rude, and we come here all the time. Absolutely brutal customer service
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	I've been filling my scripts here for almost three years and Chris always goes above and beyond to make the process as easy as possible and answer any questions. Sometimes the wait for the drive-thru takes awhile, but you can't always have it all.
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	Standard Walgreens minus the slowest drive-thru pharmacy ever and the amount of beggars you'll encounter.
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	The pharmacy here is very incompetent, and I have run into countless problems here that I have never experienced at another Walgreen's or any other pharmacy.  Every time I have a prescription filled or transferred, they make a colossal mistake.  Today was for sure my last time using them (or TRYING to use them).  I do not recommend going here, especially with so many other options nearby.
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	Most helpful and friendly pharmacy staff that I've ever encountered. The drive thru can be slow, and watch out for Boxcar Willie out in the parking lot.
SUV2tu5mfQz7Xa9C2pb6Pg	Run from this place.  I have Walgreens for years. No more. The prescriptions are not filled when promised. They lost one that took me forever to get.  Scary situation. How well are you prescriptions being properly filled if they can't the paper work right.  Horrible place.
x9NBDLv7hvpQ1mD43BfRMQ	I've been shopping at this store a few times. I entered the store and when walking in the female cashier greeted with a big smile. I did my shopping the store had everything I needed I then went to check out the cashier by the name of Yolanda greeted me again. she was very friendly I didn't have a wellness card she helped me sign up very quickly explained all the perks etc. this was a good shopping experience. they need more people like her around the store.
x9NBDLv7hvpQ1mD43BfRMQ	My husband and I live very near this store and stop in frequently for prescriptions and various health and beauty needs. Until today. I was purchasing $50 worth of gift cards and being rung up by an employee named Linda. She let me know as she begin ringing me up that gift cards could only be purchased using cash or debit. I told her that was no problem because I was using my debit card to pay for them. I swiped my card and waited for the card reader to ask me debit or credit. Linda told me I needed to swipe my card again. She hit some buttons on the register and then walked away to talk to the person at the next register. I swiped my card again, and without further prompting, without it asking me debit or credit, or confirming the amount of the purchase, the transaction completed and a receipt popped out of the register. Linda suddenly came back over and snapped at me "You hit credit."\n\nI told her, "I'm sorry, but it actually didn't give me any option, and just ran right through." She said she'd have to return the cards and rerun the transaction, and I said that was fine. I apologized again because I'm polite, but told her again that I did not hit credit, because it didn't give me the option. She responded by ripping off the receipt and handing me my items and saying, "You hit credit. You're just too fast for me." I walked out of the store and then decided to go back to get her name to make a formal complaint later, and she was talking about me to the other employee in front of other customers.\n\nDrugstores like Rite-Aid are a dime a dozen, so spend your money somewhere where employees understand you're supposed to act like a normal person and not a disrespectful teenager at work.
x9NBDLv7hvpQ1mD43BfRMQ	I usually only run in to pick up an oddball item that HT doesn't carry. Not much into shopping at drugstores, I get my scripts from BiLo. I have noticed the staff is generally friendlier at Rite Aid compared to the Walgreens down he street. My only run in with any form of trouble was when an item rang up incorrectly, the cashier was quick to fix the issue.
pY-aLDz-FUOP9kg9f79a4A	Super little Asian grocery located on Franklin Blvd. in Gastonia. Family owned and run. Has decent selection of Asian food. Some produce, frozen foods, meat. Unhatched duck/chick eggs. Incense, candles, Asian supplements and beauty.  Friendly, helpful staff. \n\nNot bad for our little town.
pY-aLDz-FUOP9kg9f79a4A	Considering that Asian supermarkets are rare in the area, this is a pretty decent place to find traditional items (aka not American items). The only thing is that the shop is tiny and looks run-down. There is barely enough room for more than one person at a time to browse through an aisle. If it was a street, it'd be one lane only. The lights were all off in the fridges in the back, which made me hesitant to buy the veggies within the fridges. I originally didn't even think they had any choy because who would think to look in those dark storage areas??! The fridges are still fairly cold, but with the lights out, you would think the fridges aren't functioning properly! The cashiers up front seem friendly, prices are okay, limited selection, and I hate to use this term but for lack of a better word, this place looks ghetto. Regardless, it's still a good spot for Asian groceries if you're in the area.
pY-aLDz-FUOP9kg9f79a4A	Tucked away and a bit hard to find but, if you're looking for Asian -related groceries, make the trip to Gastonia. Needed 3 ingredients for a Filipino dessert. Found online for good prices but high shipping costs. Couldn't find in Charlotte. Found all 3 in this store only one-quarter mile away at great prices. Highly recommend.
pY-aLDz-FUOP9kg9f79a4A	Great little place, nice folks, has what you need when cooking Asian food.
U2W3kugm4UV0zsDPsSqQmQ	Good grief, here it is two years later, I'm back in the area, without remembering that this was the place where I had the earlier experience (see my previous review)  and the same thing happened as before except this time there was no long line.  \n\nI'm at the counter on the right with my six pack of cheap beer, happy it was only $2.99, go to pay and the kid tells me I have to go to the counter across the way to pay for it because he's under age.  Helloooo.  If this is (still) an issue, why not train these babies to glance down their line to check if anyone is holding alcohol so they can give them a heads up that they  can't purchase it in their line?\n\nAnd I wonder how many times this same thing has happened to OTHER customers in the two years since I wrote my first review??
U2W3kugm4UV0zsDPsSqQmQ	I happened to be at lunch at the restaurant adjacent to this Walgreens when I remembered that I was out of my favorite multivitamin, Theragran M, and that only Walgreens still sells it. Now my family stopped shopping at Walgreens when they came out with a loyalty card and started requiring BOTH the card and a coupon to get sales prices (you have got to be kidding, I have to hassle with BOTH of these to get a discount???).\nI found my vitamins and went to check out. The cashier asked if I had a card and I said "No thanks." Now I was not snarky about it, just factually stated I don't want one. The cashier literally THREW my change and receipt at me! When the guy behind me also stated he did not have a card he stepped back a couple of steps so he wouldn't be hit when she threw his receipt and change at him.\nOne star for having my vitamins, zero stars for the bad, bad attitude.
U2W3kugm4UV0zsDPsSqQmQ	I went to this Walgreens today to get a passport photo. This meant I had time to kill in the store while they printed. It was all very clean, well stocked, and organized.  The employees were friendly.
U2W3kugm4UV0zsDPsSqQmQ	I was here back in January (yeah I am terribly late with this review) and at first I wasn't too happy with them because they didn't open until 9am and we needed some stuff to be someplace else at 9am.  But when I had a medical emergency they came to my rescue!  \n\nFirst of all it's a Walgreen's - what more need be said.  My experience was with the pharmacy department.  Long story short....got sick, needed inhaler, forgot to pack inhaler, freaked out! Went to CVS at first because I usually get my scrips there.  Guess what? Not for the inhaler! Had to call doctors office and get him to phone in the prescription.  Had him call it in to Walgreens because I just happened to have the phone number from a receipt on me.\n\nGet to Walgreens and go to pharmacy.  I tell them could they hurry up the inhaler I was in distress.  They said it would be 15mins but they'd try for sooner.  I walk away dejected and wheezing but by the time I got to the front of the store to read some magazines it was done!\n\nThanked them profusely, used inhaler, went back to hotel to rest.  Never forgetting to pack it again!!!!
U2W3kugm4UV0zsDPsSqQmQ	I always go to Walgreens, I have tended to chose them over CVS again and again since they are usually cleaner and brighter and just more updated. I was just at this one on Stapley last week and the pharmacy tech was amazing. However my experience last night will keep me from going to Walgreens all together now. I was very sick, went to urgent care and was given a script. Walmart was closest to us so we decided to just see if they had this medication as it's hard to find, they said no and to try Walgreens which I was happy with. I get to the counter and wait in line 5-10 mins, it's around 8:20 when I am finally seen and I am told immediately without her even looking at my script that they are no longer filling scripts tonight. She said they stop half hour before they close. My mother a nurse who was a pharmacist said she had never heard ever in her 35 years of working in the medical industry a pharmacy still open turning away a sick patient filling a script. We truly couldn't believe she just said that, plus the poor people who had been waiting in line with me now all were receiving the same answer. We had to drive 15 mins in a storm to a CVS. I just pray they are not turning more sick people who need their meds away like that. It's a disgrace to the Walgreens name
bZj_Yd8gKYhZDHmppHsF4A	This place charges full price for a coffee cup filled with ice just to cool down the more expensive Starbucks iced coffee you're also buying. The old lady at the front desk was a miserable person and gave me the typical excuse of "I don't make the rules". Keep your excuses. \n\nThe ice bags are half melted and the soda machines are flat. Looks like a nice stop from the outside but save yourself the hassle. Worst gas station ever. Phoenix needs more Quik Trips! Zero stars!
bZj_Yd8gKYhZDHmppHsF4A	This place was, yes, was great when I first moved to Anthem. As I start to get along with the staffs, I get up-charged for my regular iced coffee. I usually have the 16 oz but recently they charge me with the 24 oz price, plus tax it's gonna be 2 dollars for a 16 oz-cup of iced coffee?! Well, it doesn't seem that much but if you don't have much money then this would be a trouble (I'm saving for my tuition). Gotta say goodbye to my favorite iced coffee then.
bZj_Yd8gKYhZDHmppHsF4A	Staff is always friendly. Bathrooms are always clean. THey have a red box movie rental inside. Gas prices are always about average. Across the street from a nice park.
WhBBLsuDQH_eNrV3Xvo3UQ	This Rabba has saved me on numerous occasions because it is ALWAYS open. Although not nearly the size of a full grocery store you can get all you basics there. \nThey have deli, a ready-made food section and a great selection of fresh fruits and veggies.
WhBBLsuDQH_eNrV3Xvo3UQ	watch out for the tuna or egg salad. Sometimes they mix the old with the fresh and thats not good.
WhBBLsuDQH_eNrV3Xvo3UQ	This grocery store is great for convience purposes.  This is not where I would want to do my weekly shopping at, only because the bigger grocery stores have larger items. The people are very nice, and I do enjoy rabba because anytime I need something it is right there.  \nThe only thing the store did not have when I really need it were pie crusts. Other than that it has met my needs.
WhBBLsuDQH_eNrV3Xvo3UQ	This is not the nicest Rabba I have been to. Prices seem higher than other locations and sandwiches taste a little stale. The only thing this place has great hours  If you are looking for a late evening snack, Sobeys is a much better option!
WhBBLsuDQH_eNrV3Xvo3UQ	whats nice about this particular place is that if your traveling in the area, this place can be a nice change of pace from eating out.  The store is stalked with all the major essential but what I like most about this place is that it has a decent deli selection and various fruits and vegetables which can be hard to come by when your traveling and living in a hotel most of the time.  Food price did seem a litle high to me but if your comparing it to convient store prices then I would say its in the same price range.  I tried a few of the prepared salads in the deli counter, I thought the wheatberry salad had too much oil.  THe chickpea and the coucous salad were good but a little over priced considering that prices are market per 100g which isnt a lot.
WhBBLsuDQH_eNrV3Xvo3UQ	Half grocery store, half convenience store.  So, basically, you can buy cigarettes and a choose from a selection of over 75 different types of gum while you buy your groceries.  Finally!\n\nSurprisingly, the grocery items here aren't as expensive as you may expect.  The prices are at least on par with the Sobeys down the street.  Maybe even a bit cheaper. This Rabba has a large "to go" counter as well.  I haven't tried anything from it, mainly because the "hot" food never looks hot when I go in there and I'm suspicious about how long it's been sitting out for.  But hey, what do I know?  Maybe I'm missing out.\n\nThis one super robotic cashier that works there cracks me up too.  I swear she's not programmed to make eye contact or say anything but "bag?" and "can I help the next person in line?".   I have literally not heard her say anything else to anyone in the 5 or so times I've seen her there.  It's awesome.  Is there some way I can nominate her for a SPOT award?
WhBBLsuDQH_eNrV3Xvo3UQ	A place I hate to love... so convenient and like Lauren M. mentioned, prices are surprisingly not, considering how convenient it is for the thousands of people who live in City Place.  The produce is usually pretty fresh and they tend to have specials on things like apples, avocados, and other things us yups like to buy. Friends have had their deli sandwiches and potato wedges from the hot "to go" counter and enjoyed both. \n\nThe only downside is that it makes it a little too easy to sneak down out a bag of chips or other treats... My fault not theirs. \n\nOccasionally during the week they will do cash back to save you the fee of using an ATM...
WhBBLsuDQH_eNrV3Xvo3UQ	Definitely NOT one of the best rabba's ive been too. Overpriced (what you get for living in cityplace) they had some tuna cans that had expired 2 years prior to me attempting to purchase them, "fresh" prepared meals are almost always stale and expire the same day and their sales arent the huge, usually small random items like berries  or kraft dinner. Otherwise, mostly convenient for picking up few items occasionally.
WhBBLsuDQH_eNrV3Xvo3UQ	Great little convenience store/supermarket with everything you need something your fingertips. \n\nGreat place to grab s quick salad and a decent sandwich too.
WhBBLsuDQH_eNrV3Xvo3UQ	Another Rabba. This one is in CityPlace just below the Matrix condos at the corner of Front/Blue Jay way.\n\nRabbas are somewhere in between a grocery store and a convenience store. They used to be quite overpriced, but nowadays I'm noticing the pricing is not too bad considering they are open 24 hours/7 days a week.\n\nThis one has a deli counter and "hot food to go" area with rotisserie chickens, sandwiches, salads, sushi etc. I like their falafel!\n\nThe place is packed after work with all sorts of yuppies picking up quick meals.\n\nAlso, an RBC ATM inside.\n\nVery convenient!
WhBBLsuDQH_eNrV3Xvo3UQ	Currently, this is my local Rabba. Since there are no 'real' grocery stores in the blue jays way/front area, I do most of my grocery shopping here. It's not too expensive, the produce is usually decent and they definitely have all of the basics. \n\nThe Rabba's sales are on every second week or so, and when its a sale period, there are usually some pretty sweet deals. Some of the classics include pizza's for 3.99, 4 bottles of pop for 5 bucks and a big pack of yogurt for 2.99.\n\nBy no means is the Rabba comparable to shopping at Loblaws, but beggars can't be choosers and this Rabba has treated me well.
1q44aWEcDN7uRvA2l8xpvQ	Great selection! This is super convient! The person at the pharmacy was a bit gruff and not really helpful, but the actual pharmacist is great with people. The isles are very clear and it's easy to find what you're looking for.
1q44aWEcDN7uRvA2l8xpvQ	I fill my perscriptions here ONLY because it's convenient.  The pharmacy staff is constantly pi**ing me off.  I even asked my doctor to switch my one medication for another because they couldn't seem to have it when it was up for renewal.  It's like you don't matter.  There is one female in the pharmacy, idk her name but she "tries" to irritate me!  I took a coupon that my doctor gave me which would lower my co-pay to $5.00 versus $45.00.  She argued with me and argued with me that my insurance wasn't compatible with the coupon.  I was so angry I wasn't even thinking, I left.  Back home I called the number located on the coupon (which btw I did register on line).  The lady was very nice and explained that yes my insurance was able to use with the discount.  I asked how I could get this message across to the moron's at Walgreen's.  She suggested they call the number.  I called the idiot at the pharmacy and explained that she can call the number I did and she will be told exactly what I was trying to tell her earlier (that my insurance isn't welfare and will work, BCBS FEP) and she simply said oh.  No that won't be necessary, just come back and we'll fill it with the coupon.  OMG!!! Like I want to leave my house again when it's 110 degrees out.  I took a chance and went back the next day and yes!  My lucky day she wasn't there.  The person that was there simply took the coupon and applied it.  Duh!  \nQuite often I go to pick up my meds only to find out they're at Tropicana and Eastern.  WTF?  Really?  I don't want to go there, I chose this store for CONVENIENCE!  Trop and Eastern is out of my way.  They just don't seem to care and simply don't get it.  I can only pray that another pharmacy opens across the street from them so I have somewhere decent and close to go.  I was using auto refill and I was getting called 4-5 times a month to go pick up.  Finally I asked them, can't you please refill all of them at the same time?  After being told this wasn't possible I canceled the auto fill and called them all in at the same time so I could p/u all together.  I've been using this Walgreen's for 13 years and they don't know my name, I'm still just another low life coming in to bother them by picking up my meds.
1q44aWEcDN7uRvA2l8xpvQ	I love this Walgreens especially my favorite cashier JULIE! She is awesome lots of patiences. Very friendly she is the reason that I go in there, plus they are always stocked and the store is always clean and organized.
1q44aWEcDN7uRvA2l8xpvQ	Walgreens customer service stinks. One of the managers gave me attitude at the register one day and I felt like reporting her to upper management but didn't waste my time. Went in again today same sloppy customer service went for formula, asked cashier for assistance said to press a button near the formula. So I went pressed it waited nobody came. Waited some more pressed it again same thing. So I decided to just walk out and even though I live nearby I'm going to Albertsons, another Walgreens or Walmart for my business from now on.
1q44aWEcDN7uRvA2l8xpvQ	Somewhat decent location that getting to can be easy or difficult depending on traffic.\nI tend to pick my drug stores based on location, especially when there are hundreds (???)  to choose from. The lesser travelled locations, such as this Tropicana store,\ntend to have smaller lines. I was satisfied with the service here and will return when I'm in the area!
1q44aWEcDN7uRvA2l8xpvQ	Pulled up to the drive through pharmacy today.  Pressed the call button with no response. Pressed the button again, waited patiently. Again no response. Pressed a third time. Yet still no response.3 minutes later a woman with very short white hair comes to the window and very rudely says " There's a bell on this side and I can hear you I was with a customer". All with a scowl on her face. When I tried to speak with her she interrupts me and proceeds to speaks over me and says "who are you picking up for?" \nThis happened today 2-21-17 at 7:42 p.m.  Just in case anyone who can possible retrain her is reading this. \nExtremely poor customer service.
ChQnmXL3jJCZXg7ANormsQ	The location is spot on with being near other businesses that may encompass your to do/errands list and being near the freeway is another bonus. Parking lot is big enough to get gas, stop in for a snack, go through the car wash, and be on your way without too much congestion. Prices are usually a few cents lower than other gas stations and I say every penny counts. Except they do charge 35 cents fee for non cash transactions and I rarely carry 60$ cash so I end up paying the fee. \nInside has all the unhealthy snacks and drinks that anyone could ever want.
ChQnmXL3jJCZXg7ANormsQ	They pass on the $.35 debit fee on to their customers, with the amount of volume and sales they have this should be a cost of doing business, 1-star.
ChQnmXL3jJCZXg7ANormsQ	Management should be fired, only AM PM in the area I have been to that changes out the money drawers and reboots their credit card machines at 6 in the morning every day. This is rush hour and people have jobs to get to. Just poorly managed. I already poured it so I guess I'll waste 15 minutes of my day waiting to pay for this  coffee.
ChQnmXL3jJCZXg7ANormsQ	A new gas station that opened up in the area a few months ago.  Bright, clean, large convenience store.  Right next to Target and Win Co.\n\nBest part?  Coke slushies for cheap!
ChQnmXL3jJCZXg7ANormsQ	Cheap Gas! Decent Beer selection and 2 for $3 Monster.  What more could you ask for.  I nearly filled the tank up for $25.00.  It has been years since that has happened.  \n\nThis location has a car wash and vacuums to detail your car.  It will be easier to access when the LVAC is completed and the driveway connecting them opens. When travelling southbound on Decatur you have to U Turn to get the cheapest gas in LV.
ChQnmXL3jJCZXg7ANormsQ	Cheap gas but i went 2 days ago to put gas which i paid 18 dollars for the gas. And notice in my account that they took off 75 dollars which it was on hold. So i went back and talk to the manager and they told me that when you use a debit card and run it as credit 75 dollar hold comes out of your account. I've been to lots of ampms/gas stations.  This is the first i seen this never going here again. If you pay for gas just pay for it on cash. If i would  of new this before i would never put gas here. Still they haven't put my money  back its been 5 days. I wonder how long it will take they said 2 to 3 days.
ChQnmXL3jJCZXg7ANormsQ	Can I say it's about time a gas station opened up between Costco and Ann road?! A large, cheap convenience store with cheap gas that you don't need a Costco membership for? I mean, what else could you ask for!! It's probably the nearest gas station near my neighborhood that actually has a pretty big convenience store :) \n\nNeed to start a road trip with 100s of gas station snacks? AMPM is the place for you :)
ChQnmXL3jJCZXg7ANormsQ	Easy to get in and out location.  Plenty of pumps, nice car wash and lots of drinks/snacks are available.  The staff are usually friendly but there is a pay at the pump feature making it super convenient!\n\nTip...bring cash unless you want to pay the extra surcharge!!
ChQnmXL3jJCZXg7ANormsQ	One of the cheaper gas stations in NLV. It's brand new, I remember when there was nothing here but a pile of dirt. Nothing new to say about a gas station but the car wash & free vacuums are a plus. You can add a car wash when paying for your gas at the pump. (Starting at $5). And the Pay At The Pump is so convenient especially since there is a 35 cent fee for using debit/credit cards to purchase gas. :/
ChQnmXL3jJCZXg7ANormsQ	So the Indian man who works the early shift (5am-ish) is a moron. He kept forgetting to press something after I made my transaction to get gas. Going inside to use my card to get gas is already annoying to do. What's the point of the card reader on the pumps?! Anyways, I pay for my gas inside, press OK, sign, etc, the usual transaction steps, and I get to the pump and no gas is coming out. I go inside and I interrupt yet again another 10 minute conversation he's having with a random dude (he did this the first time I was in line and I was waiting really long because they were talking about a customer's friend's drama instead of letting me pay). The Indian dude is like oh no the card didn't go through. I'm like why didn't it go through when I press OK and signed and all that. He didn't freaking press OK on his end because he was busy talking!!! He did this to me TWICE. I decided to just leave while being low on gas because this idiot just made me 15 minutes late to work and I would have rather walked in this heat (it's still hot af at dawn in the summer) than see that yapping dude ever again. Screw this Arco employee. The other employees are chill and do their job, and know how to carry a conversation while getting the line moving! Give this dude some pointers or fire him already
gxAePV_hN-8VGcJAUp8BJw	Never coming back here employee that was cleaning up trash this morning was smoking next to the pump smh
gxAePV_hN-8VGcJAUp8BJw	Oh thank heaven,  what can you say about 7-11? Been coming to one of there since 1st grade. Candy, slurpees, comic books and now beer, gas, and red bull. They have the hot dogs and pizza that I won't touch for obvious reasons but you can get protein bars here. They have gas, air, water and red box. Most of the time there is a purple muscle car backed into a spot, wonder whose ride that is?
gxAePV_hN-8VGcJAUp8BJw	What can you say, its a convenience store. The coffe was pretty good and the prices are not bad when you want a drink to cool you off, warm you up or giving you a little wake up shot. Plus it has its own gas station as well but not sure about the quality of gas you're getting.
o5u-svtay8fu2lpZNe3O_w	Thank you Citi Stop for sponsoring our Cricket jerseys! Thank you for give back to the community.
o5u-svtay8fu2lpZNe3O_w	Gas at 2.43 if you pay cash or debit. What a deal. I looked on gas buddy before leaving my house for gas and seen that Vons and 76 was both 2.43. Costco was 2.45. I figure I would just stop at 76. Upon pulling in there were no lines unlike Vons. I was able to pick a pump. Upon going inside the store, the store is very clean and organize. The guy working was very friendly and thanked me for my business. I only got $20 but hey if they stay cheaper then Costco or Vons I will continue coming back. They also have a tv on the screens of the pumps will you can see the weather and watch EXTRA tv show while you pump your gas.\n\nGreat job 76 Citi Stop. I will continue coming back.\n\nPros:\nEasy access \nClean gas island\nClean store\nFriendly service\nCheap gas
o5u-svtay8fu2lpZNe3O_w	I've been watching the progress on this lot for a awhile... Now the Convenience store is open and reasonably priced might I add.  They even had my Almond Breeze milk available for those of us with allergies to soy milk..  Well I was craving a Starbucks coffee at 10 :11 PM on a Sunday.  It's brand new.  Very nicely stocked.  The employees behind the counter were friendly and greeted us as we walked in.  Barbie was really apologetic when she didn't see my boyfriend standing at the counter.  She and her co-worker really nice to us, even stuck up a SMALL TALK conversation! :) She didn't have a name tag but she had glasses and was African American.  Great work ethic as they were talking about something work related.\n\n$1.99 for this Starbucks Vanilla Iced Coffee, it hit the spot!! What's better is it's directing across from our guard gated community so I could walk if need be on a summer night.. They will have Gas on the June 28th 2015.
Z3Qm1LzmHTnL3bC-7SIwlA	Charges .35 cent debit fee on debit only pumps! Wow. The clerk was being very unfriendly. Store is clean inside. I will avoid AM PM gas stations.
Z3Qm1LzmHTnL3bC-7SIwlA	Horrible customer service during the week. Especially in the evenings.   Very zombie like and non-responsive.   I wish you could pay cash outside to eliminate interaction with them.  Clerks are friendlier during the weekends during the daytime.
Z3Qm1LzmHTnL3bC-7SIwlA	I stopped here to fill up against my better judgement since AMPM always charges a fee to use one of the most common payment methods however I was just getting gas for my company vehicle and had my company credit card.  Guess what?  They don't take credit cards!  What inner city gas station doesn't take credit cards?? How is it that AMPM can stay in business and even grow their business by buying out Rebel? It's not like they give such a great deal on anything that they can justify passing a 0.35 fee to their customers to use debit. This is really bad if you just go in for a cheap item like soda or water. Now instead of your water being 99 cents you are paying over 30% more just because you want to use your debit card. Absolutely ridiculous. I will never go to another AMPM again, ever.
Z3Qm1LzmHTnL3bC-7SIwlA	Arco (stands for the Atlantic Richfield Company) is on fire lately. Last year they have opened a handful of gas stations featuring AM-PM convenience stores. \n\n   This Arco just celebrated its Grand Opening on November 11. Fast forward less than two months later, this new Arco is an upbeat place to fuel up the car. The gas pumps are state-of-the-art. As soon as you start pumping the gas, the gas pump changes into a TV monitor that broadcasts the weather, news, and other info. This is an improvement over many of the local gas stations where graffiti carved into the pumps devastates the experience of fueling up. Although the quality of the fuel is at the top tier, the prices at the pump are at the lowest tier. According to the Arco website, they pass the lower prices by being cash and debit only. When it comes to filling up my vehicle, space is the place. Open space that is. Unless my vehicle is hitting empty, I refuse to squeeze into a cramped gas station. This Arco, on the other hand offers a lot of driving room. \n\n   Speaking of open space, I usually stop here on the way to the open spaces of the Lake Mead National Recreation Area and parklands in the Henderson periphery. This Arco is off the US 95 and Horizon Ridge Parkway corridor creating a convenient stop. The neat thing about this Arco is that it overlooks Black Mountain which is enjoyable scenery to look at when pumping gas. \n\n   When I stop at this Arco, it is more than vehicle fuel. I stop in the modern and bright AM-PM for beverages. On the weekend a 44 ounce fountain drink is 79 cents. My primary fuel is the bottle water that I will enjoy on the hiking trail. They have a deal where two bottles of Deluge spring water costs $2. This makes Arco a recommended go to spot for hikers using the adjacent Hidden Falls Park as a gateway into the Armogosa Trail. \n\n   In addition to the fuel islands and AM-PM there is a self service car wash.\n\n  When I fuel up, my expectations are more than reasonable prices. I want to pull into a station with room to maneuver my vehicle, look at a clean gas pump that is not carved with graffiti, then pick up a beverage from an attractive convenience store. This new Arco in the shadows of the US 95 and Black Mountain satisfies my expectations and a whole lot more.
Z3Qm1LzmHTnL3bC-7SIwlA	I know some folks are giving this spot a thumbs down because they don't take credit cards but the gas prices are sweet. Usually I go fill up at Costco but its always a parking lot so discovered this new spot with almost identical prices and no huge line.  The place is pretty clean inside staff varies between polite & bleh. But in the end makes my wallet happy.
Z3Qm1LzmHTnL3bC-7SIwlA	They charge to use your debit card and they charge to use Android pay. They are always out of hot food. I asked why they never have there hot food that they are famous for? The employees laughed and said the owner doesn't like us making a lot of food. I finally made the decision not to go anymore. I go across the street to Chevron.
Z3Qm1LzmHTnL3bC-7SIwlA	Such a beautiful gas station it's too bad it has the WORSE CUSTOMER SERVICE of anywhere in the Valley. I've been going there since it opened and today I stopped in to fill my tank ($88.00) and the clerk behind the counter (I didn't get the name but it was a large female "I think" ) didn't even acknowledge me and stood there I put five twenty dollars on the counter and told the pump number and pumped my gas. Went in and got my change she still didn't acknowledge me or said thank you or anything? I told her "your welcome" she THEN looked at me as if I cussed her out! I left and I'll  go down down the street and pay more before I'll ever return. \nTEACH YOUR "CLERKS" A LITTLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!!!
Z3Qm1LzmHTnL3bC-7SIwlA	What business, shuts down for 20 minutes, due to a Shift Change???? One that does not care about customers
Z3Qm1LzmHTnL3bC-7SIwlA	Used the car wash. It did a decent job but left a lot of soap and water in the door jambs and water/soap spots. I contacted the manager and he was kind enough to give me a free car wash. I decided to give it another try a few weeks after I received the free wash. I show the attendant my free wash, he goes inside to verify it but comes back out and informs me it's a different manager now and they will not honor my complimentary wash. It's still the same car wash and same owner but they don't seem to care about customer satisfaction or building up a solid customer base considering their wash is fairly new.
Z3Qm1LzmHTnL3bC-7SIwlA	I was super excited to see another gas station opening up in my neighborhood especially where it's located. Until I went there. They charge $0.35 to use your card on every transaction even debit. I will stick with good old speedy mart for sure!!
Z3Qm1LzmHTnL3bC-7SIwlA	BEWARE!!!!!! I have visited this location a few times and they have great gas prices. They also have a car wash that I have used a couple times without issue...... until yesterday. I got gas, and decided to purchase a car wash as well. I got a new car and I wanted to keep it shiny and clean. I got my receipt and drove to the car wash. There was no one there. I waited for several minutes, and since I couldn't really back up or drive forward to get out I got out of my car and started walking towards the store. The car wash guy came running up.  I went though the wash and as my car was going through I heard a disturbing noise. After I was out I noticed my back windshield wiper hanging off to the left. The metal and rubber part of the washer had been totally ripped off. I got the car wash gentleman's attention and he asked if I wanted him to go look for it....which I said of course......  Someone from inside the store came out and was on the phone calling his manager. He assured me that they would take care of the wiper blade which had been totally destroyed. He gave me the name and phone number to call the store manager today.  I called three separate times today and spoke to the manager, Bryan, who was going to talk to the owner, Paul, and get right back to me. He never did return my call, just kept making excuses for how busy he was. The last time I called he informed me that the owner said to offer me 3 free deluxe washes, but they were not liable to any damage. My heart sunk, I have a brand new car and they aren't willing to make it right over a $20 wiper blade! Very disappointing! I will never go back there for gas, car washes, or anything else. I won't give my business to anyone with that poor level of customer service no matter how cheap their gas is! I warn everyone to stay away from there because if you have any issue they will not take care of you!\n \nWanted to provide an update.  I went to Honda, and I have to replace the entire wiper, not just the blade. The entire wiper was totally bent. This is costing me $74.74 plus all the hassle.....
Z3Qm1LzmHTnL3bC-7SIwlA	If i could give this place a 0 i would first and foremost the owner of this plasce Agosh is a joke. Went here on the 25 of December and got charge twice for 2 different amount so check your receipt before leaving ill be taking this guy to court here soon for theft. Second theres no manager to handle the situation the employees a clueless and have shitty customers service and i dont blame them. The fact someone is stealing from you and the owner has no idea is pretty sad. O and its the 3rd of january and havent got any of my money back.
wuFxTWPLfU9dryRPRYk1nQ	I intensely dislike entering this shop as the staff are so rude. Don't like to mention names but , Aga you need some customer service training ASAP. It's such a weird shop.
wuFxTWPLfU9dryRPRYk1nQ	love ethics of a co-op, plus they open news stores in poor areas, not like the for profit ones who only care about shareholders.not everyone has a car and Scotmid really cares
wuFxTWPLfU9dryRPRYk1nQ	I went into this store this morning to help my Dad to do some shopping. My Dad is quite elderly and is sufferring from heart disease. As we were going around the aisles, one of the staff members approached me and started making the signs with her hands, which imply "cut your throat" or "dead" signs. She was deaf and dumb and kept making this gesture and pointing at my Dad. I was shocked and reported this to the Manager, Craig, he said he would have a chat with the member in question. I was told to ask for him or another senior member of staff the next time I go in. However I am not going to go to this shop again. What is wrong with the staff there??! I felt distraught afterwards and I felt they didnt really do anything about it.
wuFxTWPLfU9dryRPRYk1nQ	The handiest little convenience store and 24 hour!! Sells all you need at desperate times...bread, milk, booze etc!!
wuFxTWPLfU9dryRPRYk1nQ	Although somethings can be expensive they always have bargain bins full of stuff like sandwiches and wraps, fruit and veg, yogurts and crisps, micro meals and more. You can always count on this store to have what your looking for like decaf teabags which I seem to have a problem getting everywhere else but Scotmid always sees me through so why go anywhere else!
wuFxTWPLfU9dryRPRYk1nQ	I've always thought places like Scotmid and Sainsburys don't really need to be reviewed. You know what you're going to get. There's rarely any huge variations between one store and another. But this Scotmid is different. This Scotmid has Chuckles.\n\nChuckles is a person. An employee. She has worked for Scotmid for 18 years or something. If she is working, she makes any visit to this Scotmid memorable, both negatively and positively. If you're in a hurry, she'll start to drone on about whatever ailment is plaguing her at that precise moment. If you've forgotten your ID, she'll make a scene then derail the situation into some 'round-the-dinner-table racism. She'll turn buying milk and bread into an absolute nightmare if you ask how her day was. Anyway, these are all negatives. I did mention that being served by her can be a positive experience.\n\nI lied.\n\nChuckles can and will ruin your day. Her outlandish displays of horrendous customer service are legendary in these parts. Enough to knock two (2) full stars off this review of an otherwise quite decent Scotmid.
wuFxTWPLfU9dryRPRYk1nQ	Big store. Has got all the groceries you'd expect from a decent large supermarket. \nPrices are reasonable, not the cheapest but certainly not expensive. Staff is very helpful and friendly. \nThere are quite a few different supermarkets out there though and they don't really need the competition. Fresh food section is acceptable and they have a good range of gluten free and special diet products. Great selection of organic and bio products!
wuFxTWPLfU9dryRPRYk1nQ	I went in to this store to buy a bottle of water and a packet of crisps before I went for a wander, not knowing when or where I was next going to eat so thought it best to have a pack of something to keep me going.\n\nAfter getting what I had to get I went to the checkout to be ignored for a minute or two as the gent finished his conversation with another colleague. To be fair, the colleague was much more interesting than me and was giving him the "look and nod" to let him know there was a customer waiting.\n\nIn terms of stock and cleanliness, everything is kept to a pretty high standard, everything is nicely stocked and organised. Nice store, just a shame that one thing knocked a few star or two off.
wuFxTWPLfU9dryRPRYk1nQ	A medium size Scotmid store, which offers wide variety of products, have a very good fruit and veg section, with many reduced products, which makes it easy to gra a bargain. The shop have also a alcohol section, with quite good selection of beers, spirits and wines. The prices are average, some products are better value, like fruits and veg, than others. It does also sells good range of fresh bakery products.
Px4ztmjXO4fsSSoO7gWYhA	It's a gas station. What can I expect?\n\nYou can rarely tell when you go to pay for gas (cash) which register an employee is at....So be prepared to do a "shuffle". With Smith's rewards, I can get up to $1 off of gas...
Px4ztmjXO4fsSSoO7gWYhA	Good place to get gas, plenty of pumps with 2 or 3 diesel gas pumps available. They have 1 air pump/water station that cost $0.75. They have a hot food area inside the store if you want to grab a quick bite to eat and hit the road and also if you would like to wash your car or RV they have 3-4 car wash bays with I believe 2-3 vacuum stations.
Px4ztmjXO4fsSSoO7gWYhA	Don't bother going here on the graveyard shift all u will see is a sign on the door that says "be back soon", after waiting 30 minutes the first time I left and went to 7-11, a few days later same thing sign on the door "be back soon" didn't wait just left for 7-11, tonight same thing 4am sign on the door "be back soon" must be a new employee taking his pot break in the back.
Px4ztmjXO4fsSSoO7gWYhA	Angie and Imelda are my favorites!! Always ready to check me out. And they are very fast at their jobs.
LlTWbY-8zAbiyn58oIGtGg	Extremely dirty store. Staff at the photo booth is very unclean and rude. All look like they haven't showered in days. They are very poorly trained as no one knows how to do anything.
LlTWbY-8zAbiyn58oIGtGg	This location feels like walking into vintage Sunnyslope Phoenix of the 60's. It is! From the outside. Inside, clientele looked like local retirees. Although today I scored some great clearance deals there, clearly marked. That's important. Christmas chocolate,  fuzzy boot slippers, cheap sunglasses, and conditioner. All I was looking for was saline solution for my contacts. Six bucks! Meh. It was pricey for that item but I was desperate. Anyway, while at Walgreens be sure to check the prices when they ring up. I've been overcharged so many times!
LlTWbY-8zAbiyn58oIGtGg	If the Hohokams had a Walgreen's, this is it.\n\nSo as you may or may not know... I recently came upon those petroglyphs at the "19th Avenue and Greenway" site, http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-greenway-road-and-17th-avenue-petroglyph-site-phoenix?osq=petroglyphs and I feel qualified in imagining that this was Hohokam Walgreen's. \n\nI'd venture to bet that this is the longest-standing Walgreen's in the Valley - having done business in this very location since 1965. Yes, I have it on verbal record from someone whose current name tag says "Welcome to Walgreen's" that they just last month celebrated - WITH CAKE - this 50 year milestone. \n\nAwhile back, I was acquainted with the manager of this very Walgreen's. She assured me that she feared for her job. "Soon, we'll be closing." \n\nFast-forward from "awhile back" and the story still holds...that certain other-someone with her name on the "Welcome to Walgreen's" tag told me the very same story! I guess that, since the Radio Shack next door went belly-up, that nothing is for certain, but I'd again bet that this Walgreen's will be having a cake that says, "Feliz Aniversário, 60 years!" \n\nYou can't beat: \n\n- vintage dedicated liquor section! walk in, and veer left (as if you were standing upright anyway, haha) \n- decent card selection and por los todos! (se habla español ala Porky the Pig, Snoopy y otros) \n- there is a "POLISH GOODIES" place with crazy hours but crazy-yummy food http://www.yelp.com/biz/polish-goodies-bistro-phoenix hidden in this strip mall where \n"Goodwill" is the showpiece\n- I'm certain they have all the OTC pharmaceuticals and Rx only that most other Walgreen's carry...but here, they're playin' the oldies like Boz Scaggs \n- I think this really IS "wormhole Walgreen's," evidenced not only by the fantastic retro-periodical selection, but also by the fact that there is only ONE review for this location and it's from 2015. Does it keep disappearing off our present space-time continuum? Is it REALLY still there? What, where's my receipt!? Wait! I was just there this past weekend and the date on my receipt shows...\n\nYelp Review #267
LlTWbY-8zAbiyn58oIGtGg	There are no options to give 0 stars. \n\nWorst experience in any drugstore EVER!  Employee Stephanie - rude beyond abuse!. Literally stood there 20 Minutes waiting for a return on 2 pair of sunglasses purchases 30 minutes ago at another Walgreens store. (Found our previously lost pair on vacation). Stephanie was helping an elderly man with his film in his camera. Did not acknowledge that we were standing there for 20 min. Completely ignored my husband and myself. When she was free, we got nothing bit smug attitude. We were told, "due to the value of the sunglasses she couldn't do a return". Value?!! These were not Tiffanys or Gucci from Macys! These were a total of a meager $36. And purchased same day. With a receipt and card they were purchased on less than an hour ago. As we left the store, another customer greeted us at the store and acknowledged our frustration on our face and said they were the worst store ever and that the new employee Stephanie always had a smug attitude with everyone. \n\nWe left, went to a different store 2 miles away and we're treated politely, refund completed, and we're thanked as we left the store.\n\nIf I were dying of dehydration , I would not purchase another item in this awful store.
rpeFWKGrq9pRB3lvSdl2sA	It's 3am and all I want is a smoke. Off to my nearest 7-eleven which is one of the only places that carry my little grape flavoured death sticks...\n\nThe staff is pretty adman on carding me every time even though I see the same people every week. I wish they wouldn't try to push their gooey doughnuts or greasy burritos on me... don't they know my willpower is low?!
rpeFWKGrq9pRB3lvSdl2sA	Okay. This 4 star review is simply for their Slurpy selection. When you have a selection of four flavours of orange crush and 3 flavours of Mountain Dew one can't go wrong. Please note that the Mountain Dew does have caffeine. I technically only use this 7 Eleven for two things. The CIBC bank machine and to quench my Slurpy cravings. Conveniently 24 hours at Donlands and Danforth right across from the legendary The Only Cafe. Tonight I went with the combo of White mountain dew and Code Red Mountain Dew. Staff were very helpful in identifying what lid I needed for the cover when I couldn't figure it out. I didn't even ask for help. That's Customer Service!!!!
rpeFWKGrq9pRB3lvSdl2sA	Sticky sticky sticky feet. It's like the Slurpee machine exploded all over the floor in here. It's not a wonder though as I came here on the first official day of heat Toronto saw this summer. Humidity of 99% is a solid guarantee that my husband will need a frozen slushy. This was one of the only Slurpee machines that maintained an acceptable ice to syrup ratio. And if you are feeling a little peckish they have the counters absolutely chock full of whatever impulse buy you might have need for.\n\nAs a side note this location has a post office inside, but truly abysmal parking options. Walking or TTC are much better travelling options when making it to this Danforth locale \n\nBottom line...while the staff are not exactly friendly, and the floor is exceptionally sticky, if you are looking for an excellent Slurpee, look no further.
rpeFWKGrq9pRB3lvSdl2sA	When you need a slurpee this is a the place to go (actually any 7-Eleven is, really).   I wasn't really interested in any eats at the time so I can't comment on the food.  But the slurpees are good.
rpeFWKGrq9pRB3lvSdl2sA	Horrible, went there for an iced coffee, took a MEDIUM cup, from the stand area marked MEDIUM and the guy tried charging me for a large.\nTold him to keep it and went to Starbucks across the street.\n\nThe guy would not answer me as to why the MEDIUM was in the LARGE slot, only insisted I pay for a large, There is much better on the Danforth.
rpeFWKGrq9pRB3lvSdl2sA	Located across from the TTC Rocket this 7-11 is conveniently located, I guess most 7-11 have to be as part of the strategy. \nMy main reason for coming here is to rent movies from the best buy movie rental kiosk. \nThe place seems clean and is well organised. I haven't interacted with the staff much so can't comment on the service. The prices for some food items seem OK (some adverts are shown prominently all over the store) \nConvenience is the main selling point here I if one wants to get something in the wee hours of the night. \nJust like any other 7-11 store and seems well kept.
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	This is the best one stop craft brew bottle shop, growler fill, wine cellar, liquor store, in the east valley, hands down! Don't take my word for it...Look through the reviews over the years. Yes, this place has been right under your nose and you didn't know it!\n\nI come here every so often, especially around the holidays when your warehouse liquor depots are super crowded and sold out of that thing you're looking for. Chances are good you'll find it or at least another gem you might not have even heard of.  Their prices are comparable to the big boys and in my experience cheaper than most grocery stores.\n\nI've never pumped gas or got a car wash here so I can't comment on that. This is your typical looking, convenient corner store that packs as much awesomeness into a small space like this as you can imagine! Great selection, good prices, best of all you don't feel like you're fighting the crowds! \n\nIf you prefer to shop smaller and local, and don't need the 'expertise' the bigger stores offer on your selection you'll like it. It has none of the big box warehouse feel.
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	What a fabulous little hidden gem!\n\nIt's a gas station. I went to get some gas.\n\nI walk inside and instead of a bunch of junk food there are all different one-of-a-kind beers and spirits! \n\nDid I die and go to heaven early?\n\nThen as I sit there slack-jawed with excitement, I notice all these people coming in with growlers.\n\nThis isn't just some gas station.\n\nThere's a beer cave and wine cellar and so many different beers and liquors and flavors and so cheap!!!\n\nNeedless to say, I forgot to get gas.
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	Holy freaking crap!! Craft Beer. A mile of awesome Craft Beer hiding in a gas station/car wash!! A huge walk in cooler, taps and growlers of deliciousness! We were in AZ visiting friends and looking for local beers; this " gas station " was recommended and we spent at least an hour deciding which beers to take home to Chicago. Lots of West Coast beers that are hard to get in Chicago! Run. Do not pass Go. Bring lots of money and your growlers. Prices are just a squeak higher than other retails but when you've got the goods-I guess you can call the prices. Worth the stop in if you're a craft beer lover!!
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	When gas pump malfunctioned and wiped out my Fry's fuel points that would have saved 20 cents per gallon, employee refused to make it right; told me to call Shell. All he had to do was refund a couple of dollars if I filled my tank. Very poor customer service.
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	This place is crazy fun! No need to battle the parking lots and big stores like Total wine... This place has so many beers and liquors to choose from and growlers to fill as well!! Yummy!!
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	Love this Carwash! Always clean and staff is very nice. Fair prices and free vacuums!
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	Best $5 Car Wash in the valley.  They always have an attendant at the front end standing by to prewash your car before it goes into the tunnel. Gas prices are competitive.
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	I heard about this place from one of the servers at a bar I frequent. I live just down the street and was surprised that I had never stopped in for even gas. When he told me about the selection of beer, wine, cigars, I was skeptical - so I stopped by on my way home. I needed gas anyway. \n\nOne thing I discovered is it is challenging to get into the station. Coming from the direction I did I had to go to the light, turn left, but then the median prevented me from pulling in. So it was a drive down the block, U-turn, come back, and finally I could enter. Coming from the other direction would have been no problem. I filled up and went inside. I don't know if they were playing Belinda Carlisle's "Heaven is a place on Earth" or if that was just my inner voice performing late-afternoon karaoke. I was amazed at the selection this unassuming from the outside gas station had once I entered the front door. I would put it up there with Tops in Tempe or Sun Devil Liquor in Mesa. A gas station! You want kegs? They have them. You want to peruse more than 700 wines? They have them. They have liquor too. You want beer? And not Bud Light or The High Life, but actually good craft beer from dozens of breweries around the country? They have a walk in beer cave with cans, bottles, and bombers from wall to wall and floor to ceiling - they say over 1000 beers! How about a cigar on the way out? A walk in humidor with over 500 cigars also is located inside. This magical place is located about 2 miles from my apartment and U.O.E.N.O. it. It will likely be my new stop for gas and supplies!
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	Talk about a hidden gem! Who would expect a 700 bottle selection of wine in a temperature controlled room, a growler station with local craft beers and a walk-in humidor in a gas station? A gas station with a post office outlet, I might add. It's like an old time general store!\n\nTheir prices are great. We've been able to get some high end bourbons for $5 less than Total Wine. They carry some of my favorite AZ wines, and they even stock stuff that Total Wine doesn't have like Aviation gin and Cruzan guava rum, a staple at all our family parties. My husband says their cigar selection and prices are competitive too.\n\nLike Mark T., I also hear music in my head when I walk in this place, usually, "It's the stuff that dreams are made of." You must check this place out if you're in the East valley.
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	I was dumbfounded walking into this place - I had spent (waisted) far too much time at BevMo & Total Wine looking for a type of Aquavit they didn't carry (Krogstad Festlig made by House Spirits of Portland, OR). Stepping thru the door I instantly knew they would have it.....but I couldn't make to the spirit section because I was completely distracted by the craft beer selection. Holy crap! Heaven. And yes, they did have the Krogstad. And their prices were reasonable.
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	Save your money and just wait for it to rain the dirt off.  This was my 2nd visit trying the carwash, no improvement. Overkill in the soap, which doesn't get completely washed off. Once you make it through to the end, the dryers blow off the soap as it slides down your windows and you have to go home and wash the DRY SOAP off the windows. May I suggest an attendant be placed on the end to touch up the car??? \n\nI failed to mention that the attendant stationed at the beginning, may want to wait 5 seconds to let the driver roll up all the windows!! \n\nStop advertising a car wash and just stick to selling alcohol.
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	Ohemgee! I've lived just a mile away for years, and a friend just introduced me to this place! It's like a Bevmo...only better, because you can get Twix, beef jerky, and gas too!
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	This is the best automatic car wash around. There is an attendant to make sure the quality is there, so bring a tip if you're so inclined. Free vacuums. Great beer selection, too!
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	Ummmmm are you kidding me? Killer selection of beers and growler fills at a gas station. Who would have known? I certainly didn't, as we don't have anything like this in Southern California. A massive amount of bottles and cans of great quality beer as far as the store reaches. With tap handles hidden through out the store. It really is a site to see if you are a fan of great tasting beers. I wish we had something like this where I live. \n\nCome here, buy beer, fill your growler and repeat process. \n\nCHEERS!!
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	Coolest gas station ever - multiple coolers of beer, growler fill stations, it's incredible!
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	Okay, so your YouTube commercials got to me Quick N Shine. If it wasn't for my incessant YouTube watching, I never would have found out about this obscure gem hidden in a regular looking carwash. I didn't get my car washed but the price seemed reasonable, and the machinery looked to be in good condition where you get the wash. Promising hard to find liquors and bourbons, I made the trek here to see what they had. There was nothing out of the ordinary as far as bourbon went (you're not going to find any Pappy), although they had a very nice selection. I was impressed by the selection in their cigar humidor, it smelled so good and everything was nestled in straw. Their refrigerated wine section was a welcome feature in this sweltering weather but they had a good selection of higher priced wines, moderately priced, and bottles under $10 refrigerated. Need a wooden luxury car keychain tag? They have those too: $3 each. \n\nThey have a growler station, two in fact from what I saw at least. You can either buy them there or you can pick up some refills. A few things here and there will be priced a couple of bucks higher than places like Total Wine etc., but the majority of the pricing was the same or a few bucks cheaper. Besides being a swinging liquor store, the other half of the store is a regular gas station convenience store.
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	Shell Gas Station on the NE side of the intersection. This place is awesome for the price!  You have an attendant that presoaks your car! They supply FREE vacuums for you to use as long as you like. The wash uses spinning linen to wipe of the AZ dirt. You can't beat all that for only $7.00.
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	Best gas station. Close to my house, gas pumps give you 10 cents off with frys fuel points, and they have a huge selection of craft beer. I'm glad there's a place nearby that sells good stuff. They also have lots of hard liquor and wine. Friendly clerks too. There's a car wash too I havnt used it but from the other reviews I guess it's good?
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	Very nice job done cleaning up the car.\n\nGood price.  Excellent service.\n\nChoice of fragrance spray; dash-cleaning cloths that really work.  Rain-X window spray and excellent wax.\n\nWhat's not to like?\n\nDownside: some water on car after going through the blower system.  Not that big a deal, really...
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	OK - I've been enjoying this hidden oasis of alcohol for about a year now - but I only hit it about once a month - maybe once every couple of months.  When driving by recently, I noticed a sign that mentioned growler fills.  Last night, I walked in the door, and nearly sh@t myself with glee and jubilation.  Smack dab in the middle of the store is a  brand new, 15 foot long bar with about 20 taps of amazingly good, high end micro brews, and it's a GROWLER FILL STATION.   I felt like the God of Beer had instantly shone his holy light upon my liver.  This place is going to cost me some serious $$$$ this summer.  Gilbert is becoming so legit I almost can't stand it!!  I'll take a pic the next time I'm in there.....
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	This little gas station is such a hidden gem. The car wash is excellent! Free vacuums and a high-pressure blower. Inside is super cute with an amazing variety of beers and wine. Highly recommend for a quick wash or the deluxe.
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	I've been getting my brew here for a few years now.  Like what others are saying they have a remarkable selection and also carry some hard to find brews e.g. Hopslam Ale.   Sure prices are a little high but this is a convenience store not Total Wine.  The growler selections are usually spot on and I can almost always score some Fresh Squeezed IPA or Green Flash.  They also support local breweries pretty well which is good to see.  \n\nWhat I hadn't known all of these years is just how good their car wash is.  Free vacuums, lots of spaces, and an amazing thorough wash.  I feel like such an ass for wasting my money at full service car washes that take 45min.  After experimenting with some of the $5 washes I have no need to go elsewhere.  Give it a go and I think you will be amazed.
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	I needed a quick wash, just the exterior. Stopped here and you can pay inside or outside for wash. Their convenience store has a plethora of items, right down to mini liquor bottles. The wash was quick but very unsuccessful drying. Thankfully there were vacuums with air hoses to blow off the rest of the remaining water on my car. Colorful light show as you pass through the wash. Entertaining for the kiddos.  Oh! They also offer growlers here. A little far from my house but will remember the growler station for next time!
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	There are not enough great things to say about this place! Huge selection of wine and craft beer and amazing customer service.\n\nMy first visit there, I was checking out their beer selection, unaware of the walk in beer cave and a manager came up to me to show me they had everything cold. After a long day, I needed em cold! Cigar selection, too. I have not used the car wash here.
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	As soon as I moved to the Valley I started scoping out the liquor stores in the area. You've got your BevMo's, Total Wine, and a few nice little neighborhood package stores; but this store... THIS store...\n\nMy girlfriend and I call it 'The Most Convenient Convenience Store in the World", and with good reason. You need something, you come here first. Briquettes for your grill? Check. Toilet paper? You got it. A larger selection of imported, craft, and hard-to-find beers than you can find anywhere else in Arizona... .... uh.... ... check???\n\nI'm not sure that their selection beats other stores, because honestly I haven't been to any other stores in God-knows-how-long. Full disclosure, this place IS just right up the street from my house, but every time I come here I've discovered something new and amazing. \n\nScenario:  You have a day full of chores that you just don't know how you're gonna do. You've got a box full of old clothes for Goodwill, you're planning a grill-out with your brochachos, you need to mail off your tax return, and you think you might like to try a nice cigar. Normally you'd have to pop all over town... or you could just come here. Donation box out by the pumps. Full walk-in humidor. Amazing selection of beers, wines, and liquors. AND IT'S A FULL US POSTAL SERVICE LOCATION. Yeah, you need something 2-dayed, you just holla at my people at 777. Seriously. \n\nSo come check this place out. Stop inside and say hello- everyone here is really friendly. I'm sure that some other places around might have better selections of certain things, but for a one-stop shop, this place knocks Costco out the park (okay, so maybe you can't buy an LED TV here, but I think it's just a matter of time...)
itJ5Amsr2XeGwGd90l3I8w	This place is not what I  would call in a convenient location, but it is worth going out of your way.  The car wash equipment is always kept up and the wash is excellent.  This is my go to place to wash both my vehicles.
R60ybR-D3D4DskaztX1qHA	This location is by far my favorite.  They know me and my 14 year poodle by name and they always have her medication and diabetic supplies on hand for her.  The pharmacy staff are just all just amazing. Also, the Manager is ALWAYS working hard.  He seems to be hands-on.
R60ybR-D3D4DskaztX1qHA	This Rite Aid is pretty well stocked. Staff doesn't smile much but they are polite. I come here when I don't feel like dealing with the CVS crowd . They always seem to be busy at CVS, I often wonder why people are at CVS all hours of the day
R60ybR-D3D4DskaztX1qHA	Above average for most chain but still too much unprofessional chit chat going on\n\nThis is our secondary pharmacy of choice.. Our medical insurance dictates the primary choice.but does permit us to override the primary choice for a premium\n\nToday had a last minute prescription called in for my wife. We went to dinner to give them time to fill it which they did. We pulled up to the drive through and hit the call button.\n\nI could see inside and they were having a good time and chose to ignor the call button till they had finished their review of the world.\n\nReasonably good service y take out the unnecessary delays because of unprofessional behavior\n\nNot the first time and I'm sure will not be the last
7fOZVdXQfEhZkZ9ZOcHOjA	A fairly decent Walgreens. This location did not carry as many items I have found in others, but everything was organized and clean. The employees were helpful and friendly.
7fOZVdXQfEhZkZ9ZOcHOjA	Manager Mark was very rude when my prescription was expired...basically threw it back at me and said I can't help you, bye. I called my doctor and she was able to fix it in 5 mins. Drive through has a 10 minute wait and there was no line.
7fOZVdXQfEhZkZ9ZOcHOjA	I think don helped me today in photo. Couldn't possibly be more annoyed. No hello. Had to stand there for 10 minutes just to have him huff and puff over nothing. Terrible customer service, I won't be back.
7fOZVdXQfEhZkZ9ZOcHOjA	This is where I go to pick up my prescriptions monthly. I've had a decent experience all the other times but recently I had some questions about my billing and the pharmacy tech was extremely rude her name was Eva I think and she made me feel really stupid and was not helpful at all. I was very nice and patient with her while she figured out my problem and all I got in return was her snotty attitude. \n\nI'm probably going to have my prescription transferred even though this Walgreens is one minute from my house. \n\nIt's not worth the convenience if their staff is consistently rude for no reason during a 5 minute drive through interaction.
7fOZVdXQfEhZkZ9ZOcHOjA	This is definitely the most convenient store for sundries near home, or at least my home away from home or my other home. Whatever. \n\nI didn't see any homeless when I visited the store in the evening, but I was just intent on rushing in, finding the Neutrogena item I needed, paying and heading on down the road. The item was on sale, rather 2 for 1, so of course, I bought two.\n\nThey did have a good selection of Neutrogena brand items, so I'm sure to be back.
7fOZVdXQfEhZkZ9ZOcHOjA	Walgreens is Walgreens:  they have stuff you need and it's convenient. \n I want to write this to warn you of the growing homeless population that seems to live outside of this location.  I honestly feel bad for people that are stuck in this situation but begging just makes me feel uncomfortable.  Not a day goes by that I shop here and am pestered with requests for money.  The thing is that I don't really carry cash ever so I feel bad for not having any but also feel violated for being requested to shell out my hard earned cash to someone that is setting up camp outside a drug store and speaking low and incoherently and walking towards you and your car.  Gives me the creeps.
7fOZVdXQfEhZkZ9ZOcHOjA	I was so impressed by the wonderful service. I think the store was crowded because today they were offering a discount to seniors.  But the staff handled the rush very well. \n\nThis is not my  neighborhood Walgreens.  I stopped in after a class at Devonshire Senior Center and was amazed by the staff.  The manager was up front.  very welcoming.  directing the staff.  checking the outside of the store.\n\nA clerk, Jesus, directed me to the right isle and when I was checking out, he asked if I found everything.  I described the one item I did not find and he went back and found it for me.  very polite.\n\nThis was about two in the afternoon and the parking lot was free of pan handlers.  I would guess that there is new management  at this location and that people in the neighborhood should give this place another try.

This is strange for a place that was built around the pharmacy business.  Pharmacists here=decent people.  The pharmacy techs=overpaid, spoiled pains-in-the-asses.  They consistently act as if they're doing you a favor by filling your prescription for you.  The vagrants here are also a problem  Just drive to new CVS down the street or wait until real stores are open for convenience purposes.
7fOZVdXQfEhZkZ9ZOcHOjA	Every time that I walk in I am greeted by friendly people and if I ever have a hard time finding what I am looking for, there is always someone there to take me to the item.\nVery friendly and courteous employees here.
7fOZVdXQfEhZkZ9ZOcHOjA	Unfortunately this Walgreens, for pharmaceutical purposes, is lacking in the "customer service" area entirely. It is the most conveniently located drug store to both my house and my doctors office, however I would much rather drive the extra few miles to not have to deal with the head ache that come with this one. \n\nI spend about 25 minutes in the drive through the other day, and there was only one car in front of me. When I order my refills online they are almost never ready when I ask for them to be. The abundance of homeless people meandering outside is obnoxious to say the least. \n\nYou eventually get what you came for, but go elsewhere if you want to get anything done in a timely manner.
7fOZVdXQfEhZkZ9ZOcHOjA	If it wasn't for the bums outside the store EVERY time i go in there it would be a lil better. but seriously. come on! there goes not one day i find a bum asking me for a dollar or some change. I'm sorry i work to hard for my money to just hand it over to you to go buy a tall can. \n\ni avoid this place at all cost unless there is nothing else in the area. (walmart on thomas and 36th st but thats in a different review lol) \n\ndo something about the bums and ill consider coming back to your store
7fOZVdXQfEhZkZ9ZOcHOjA	I would like to give them some credit.. They gave me two free books and a store credit when I went back. At least they made it right. Thank you Alex (store manager)
