--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	These guys are great. \n\nExtremely friendly and nice service. Food is perfect, I wish they would dim their lights and make more cosy atmosphere. The food sure deserves it. \n\nAnyway, this restaurant well deserves full five stars. \n\nFood is great. \nService is careful, accommodating and friendly. \n\nEveryone should try it out
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	What a wonderful surprise, this restaurant was. This is a family owned restaurant and they are all so nice and welcoming. I had the kafta plate which was more than enough food. They do a special trick with the rice which makes it taste like no other. You will have to give it a try.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	Ordered takeout from the place and the food was great. We got the gyro salad, a side of falafel and also the gyro plate! Definitely will be coming back for more! Have been wanting to find a good mom and pops Mediterranean place nearby and this is it! Decent prices for a good amounts of food!
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	fantastic to have a true Mediterranean restaurant where everything is fresh and tasty. try the yogurt drink...perfect!  chicken Sharwma was superb. my new favorite local restaurant
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	All the food is very fresh and incredibly delicious. I had the falafel plate, which included not only 6 falafel patties, but a salad and a generous helping of hummus and pita. Everything was prepared to order (not ahead of time) and spiced to perfection. The staff were very friendly, to boot.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	super fresh food..great prices. ala carte and entrees both.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	Great Food! Good Service! Very friendly family owned business. I'll be back many times! I love the food. The chicken, the bread, rice, salad. Everything is great. Very fresh, quick service and wonderful.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	This probably one of the better Middle Eastern restaurants I've eaten at in Northern Phoenix and they are a very nice family run restaurant. The food is great, the prices are very good and it's very fast ... you can't beat that!
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	My new favorite Mediterranean food restaurant! Great food at a great price. Wonderful customer service. The grape leaves and gyro are amazing
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	I saw a sign for this place on our way to the movies this weekend. We stopped by for lunch after our movie.\n\nPlace is small and so so. Service was really good.\nWe had the humus with meat (great idea), hubby had a gyro sandwich (pita wrap) and he loved it. Fries were good too, tasty and crunchy.\n\nI had ordered a cubideh sandwich (wrap) but ended up just eating the humus, and taking the wrap home.\n\nHubby thought humus was kind of bland, I thought it was OK.  The meat was like hamburger meat but with herbs and spices, I liked it very much. The portion was reasonable (~$8, it is an appetizer).\n\nWe want to come back to try the grape leaves, the baba ganoush, and the tabouleh.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	Very Cool Mom and Pop restaurant serving some delicious and very affordable middle eastern food. You can dine inside their cozy restaurant or have them fix you up for some tasty take out.\n\nBelieve or not we used to live right behind this restaurant before they built the SR51. Sure wish they were here back then. We could have easily walked right up or taken our bikes and had one of those stimulating Green Earth experiences.\n\nCame in here the first time and went with the standard Gyro combo with fries and a drink. Caught an eye of the Baklava sitting nearby and had to also get one of those bad boys. Food was very tasty and I made sure to bring the wife back for a return visit.\n\nThe menu is pretty good sized and has all the popular favorites that you can imagine. Gyros, Kababs, Shawarmas, Falafel, Hummus and then some. I also really like the take out menu. It is nicely done and has several pictures of all the different items. Nice!\n\nThe owners are both super friendly and excited when you arrive. We even talked baklava recipes for a moment while we were settling up. They make theirs the same way we do using pistachios and a touch of cardamom and a hint of rose water in the syrup.\n\nRight next to the large movie theater in the adjacent Rad Shack parking lot. See you there next time. KEEP IT LOCAL WHEN CAN!\n\n4 STARS
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	Delicious. The salad is outstanding. The kebobs were outstanding. The humus is bland, bit well made. The iced tea is terrific. The staff are friendly. The prices are reasonable and the servings large. I had to try the beef egg roll; quite different and fun. We will definitely return.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	Love this place! Great tabouleh, falafel and kibbeh. Decor is a little antiseptic so best bet is takeout. Family run business which is great. We have generally went to Sabas but after trying Kabob house we haven't been back to Sabas once.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	This place is FANTASTIC! Very generous portions for the amount of money your meal costs. Get the gyros!  So delicious. Everything is made fresh to order. Their hummus with the ground beef was very good. This place, while not fancy, definitely is comparable to The Persian Room at a fraction of the cost.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	Our new favorite resturant for a weekday date night! We werent sure what to expect at first when walked in. Though we were happily surprised by both the great food and kindness of the employees! We ordered the Gyro plate and the Kabab Koobideh plate. They both came with a generous portion of rice and a wonderful half salad and at a decent price! It left us full but not overly stuffed. We'll definitely be back with friends and look forward to trying more of the unquie menu.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	This place is AMAZING and DELICIOUS!!!! The food is authentic and made to order. I would come here everyday if I lived closer. Don't miss this tasty and satisfying new restaurant!!!!!
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	Unhappy about the hours. Change the yelp ad. You guys are closed Sunday! I drove all the way out to get my favorite food to find you are closed.... Common now!!
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	The service was great and the variety on menu good. All food prepared up front visible to the customer which I like. The food was great, be prepared to leave full.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	I was in the Kabab House for the first time on Sunday night and I simply loved it. Great family owned business that had fresh food & a great feel to it. I'll be going back and I would recommend it to anyone. Great experience.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	I am always SUPER excited when an authentic ethnic eatery pops up in my hood. And Kabab House definitely did not disappoint!\n\nIt is right by our house and after passing it countless times we finally decided to pick up some takeout for a late lunch.\n\nI ordered the falafel pita and my husband had the chicken schwarma pita. My husband picked it up and said the family that ran the place is so nice. The guy at the counter even gave my husband a free soda because he felt bad about the short wait for food.\n\nHe brought our food home and we were surprised when we opened our food boxes with the enormous serving of french fries that came with the pitas. They were piping hot and sprinkled with a unique seasoning. We were only able to eat about a third of the fries, since our pitas were huge as well. My falafel pita was awesome. Very flavorful. My husband loved his chicken pita and said the seasonings were perfect. They gave us sides of sriracha. That is a restaurant after my own heart.\n\nI highly recommend Kabab House. Lots of delicious food for a reasonable price served by a very nice family.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	The best Middle Eastern food I've had in Phoenix!  I tried this for the first time last night.  I asked the gentlemen if they were family recipes and he said of course.  I will say, I am incredibly picky about my falafel.  I try it everywhere and outside of Saba's, am consistently disspointed, no matter how good the other dishes may be.  When I tried this falafel, I knew I had found a place for me!  Additionally, the meat was so tender and delicious!  The kabob mix, with chicken, beef and kefta was amazing!  The food is incredibly fresh an excellent quality.  I will agree that the hummus is not as flavorful as some I had, but it was still very fresh.  Since it's a family recipe, I just thought maybe their family didn't like as strong of a flavor to it?  Plus I find most people to think hummus is supposed to taste like the stuff from the market or Trader Joes.  That's not real hummus.\n\n It was a bit slow in preparation, but they haven't been in business that long, and making everything fresh does take more time.  It's not a nice, sit down dining environment.  Fine for a lunch or whatever, but just don't want anyone to be disspointed if you're doing here for a nice dinner, but the food cannot be beat, so perfect for takeout or a very casual dinner.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	So I was super excited when a new middle eastern restaurant opened up within walking distance. Unfortunately, I'm left pretty disappointed.\n\nTo the staff's credit they were incredibly polite and the service was great. Unfortunately the food was simply bland, especially the hummus. I'm pretty sure they just ground up some chickpeas and called it a day.  Also the food took way longer than it should have.  The cook must be pretty new to this whole restaurant thing because they only cooked one meal at a time. I had to watch them cook and serve the 2 other people who arrived before me one by one in order.  Given that pretty much everything served here is either already prepared or grilled, they should be able to prepare multiple orders at once.\n\nI'll try them again in a couple months just to be fair, so I hope some garlic and spices finds it way in to their food.
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	My Daughter, grandsons and I were looking for something fast and healthy so I Yelped Restaurants in area we were in......the reviews were great so we went with them!! Soooo glad we did..............the service was outstanding and the food Delish..........She and I had the Kafta Combo and loved it!!\n\nOne of the boys had a cheese burger (go figure) and loved it too and the other ordered the Falafel (from watching Kickin it) but was not crazy about it (prob too young to appreciate different cultures yet) so Mom switched plates with him had his  Falafel, and he loved his Kafta ..............bringing Dad next time!!
--g-a85VwrdZJNf0R95GcQ	Great food, and great prices.  The family and staff are informative and kind.  The food was very fresh (I watched the lady make my foule and I watched the guy make everything else right in front of me).  \n\nAs a caveat, I don't think I would classify this food as "Mediterranean" or "Greek."  I would call their food Middle Eastern and Arab, which is what I expected.  Regardless, it was good.  I think Yelp controls the classification.
--lpHMVmkCuji0ZrpHtXEA	Julia with SkinRN is amazing! She is highly educated but down to earth with a wonderful personality.  She truly cares about the results you want to achieve.  I used Derma Pen and laser for vein removal.  She is professional and honest about what you need and how often you need treatments.  Would recommend her to ANYONE!!
--lpHMVmkCuji0ZrpHtXEA	Julia from SkinRN has SAVED MY SKIN and bikini line. I started going to Julia for Laser Hair Removal on my bikini line and armpits. I have always been insecure about these areas and wanted to improve them. Julia has not only improved by bikini line and armpits, but has made it FLAWLESS in these areas. There are no more razor bumps, or shadows  I feel so confident in my own skin and I no longer need to hide under a sarong. I had such AMAZING results with the hair removal that I also trusted Julia with the Dermapen facial. My pores are nonexistent and it improved my acne scars and hyperpigmentation in one treatment. I will ONLY trust Julia with my skin.
--lpHMVmkCuji0ZrpHtXEA	I had such a great experience with my laser hair removal with Julia! From my first consultation, she proved to be an expert in her field. It was really important for me to find an affordable treatment plan without compromising on quality of service.  Skin RN hits both of those marks. The treatments are effective and I am thrilled with the results. And Julia is extremely sweet and makes the whole process as comfortable as possible.  I would DEFINITELY recommend her business.  I have found her practice to be clean, safe and very professional.  My skin feels safe and better yet, hair free!
--q7kSBRb0vWC8lSkXFByA	This is my favorite "local" bar! stiff cheap drinks, great food for if i don't feel like cooking, trying to avoid fast food, and especially for after a late night. I can come here anytime of day and be entertained, enjoy a drink, and a good meal. My faves here: wings, pizza, any of the sandwiches (including the burgers), breakfast, Josh and steed. but dont go. it's my personal oasis.
--q7kSBRb0vWC8lSkXFByA	Typical sports bar but a good place to watch a game and enjoy a great meal. Garlic Knots are tasty. The pizza is fantastic!!
--q7kSBRb0vWC8lSkXFByA	We live in the neighborhood and have been here many times and have always had great service in the past. We always order dinner and play the video machines at the bar. This was our first Friday evening at Double Play and the service was horrible! The quality of the food was very good, as always. The two bartenders seemed oblivious to our presence and made no eye contact with us or other patrons until engaged in a transaction. In short...the only thing lacking here is the staff's attention to the patrons. Game-up people!
--q7kSBRb0vWC8lSkXFByA	Excellent Pizza! I am picky about my Pizza, and this place is one of the very few that I come back to, because I crave it. Excellent thin crust. This is a Villa Pizza outlet inside a nice, huge Sports Bar. Highly recommended.
--q7kSBRb0vWC8lSkXFByA	Another neighborhood watering hole of mine - I love that they have a mini game room and a shuffle board table.  Try the pizza and catch a game or two.. they have a ton of screens.  I also think they have quiz nights on Tuesday nights.. but don't quote me on that.
--q7kSBRb0vWC8lSkXFByA	This is a fun spot to watch games and eat good bar food. They usually have some kind of raffle giveaway during big games too, which I've won a couple times :) ! I come here for the burger though! I swear it is the best I've had in Vegas..... very random, I know. You can "create your own" with type of cheese, sauce, bun, etc. I always get a burger cooked medium with swiss cheese, sauteed mushrooms, and hickory smoked bbq sauce on toasted sourdough. It is soooo good!!! with a heaping amount of fries! \nMy boyfriend swears by their pizzas, which are also delicious! \nOverall this is a good spot to play video poker, get good drinks by a very friendly staff, watch a game, eat a great burger, and play elvis pinball!
--q7kSBRb0vWC8lSkXFByA	Great place to watch football games in Vegas. Great staff with a great menu. A bit off of the strip but its worth the 5 minute drive south on Vegas Blvd.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place is awesome!!!  I am a die-hard fan of Robert's in Tucson but this is the first place that gives them a run for their money.  Homemade thick slabs of bread served with fresh strawberry jam and an egg scramble with spinach and havarti = breakfast heaven.  This place is tiny and I'm sure gets packed as we went on a Tuesday morning and there was a small wait but it's so worth it!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Not really worth the wait. food was ok, hash browns were under cooked and my pork chop was dry, boo hiss. Staff was very nice, but they seem to have a hard time keeping up with all the people. Biggest disappointment of the morning was when a party of 8 showed up 15 mins after our party of 3 and was seated before us???? not really sure how that worked out? Oh yeah no bathroom, make sure not to order any coffee.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Eh?  How have I not written a review for Matt's?  I went there a while back, but thankfully it won't be hard for me to recall the experience!\n\nPlace - Small.\nFood - Fantastic.\nWait - Usually.\nBathroom - An adventure.\n\nWe didn't have too long of a wait when we went, but that was entirely luck. I've seen crazy waits here, which is just par for the course when the food is good. Most of it is local and very, very good. Service was fast, and spot on.\n\nThe bathrooms are next door in an old motel. Apparently a separate room set aside just for Matt's. Just one more stand out feature for a very stand-out sort of place!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Fantastic breakfast place.  Always worth the wait.  Found the place from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives show.  I'm a big fan of breakfast, but I also know what a great breakfast tastes like.  This is it.  Don't be discouraged by the wait time or the close quarters.  Belly up to the counter if you're claustrophobic.   \n\nEverything I've eaten off of the menu has been stellar.  Some reviewers said orange juice was small, but it's fresh-squeezed and delicious (unless you just brushed your teeth).  Hog and Chick, Griddle Cakes, Waffle and Bacon, all phenomenal.  \n\nService is always excellent here.  Sometimes there were three different people waiting on our party, but we never lacked for a thing.  Give it a shot!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'd have to say it was a decent breakfast... nothing more, nothing less.  I had a cheddar cheese and ham omelet with hashbrowns, sourdough toast and mediocre coffee.  The hashbrowns were on the greasy side, but that didn't bother me; it's just that nothing blew me away either.  The service was a bit slow considering we got there at about 6:50 a.m. and there were open tables; so I can only imagine how it would be at any other time of the day.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Believe the hype, the food is delicious! I recommend anything with bacon or the chorizo with eggs and jalepenos...YUM!  If you don't like the wait, have breakfast for lunch (its pretty easy to get in around one).
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	It's one of those mixed blessings.. do you eat/sample at the Farmer's Market or eat breakfast here first and then feel too full to impulse buy from the market later...\n\nBut if I'm driving 1/2 hr from EV to hit Phoenix's Farmer's Market, then it is totally worth the stop here.  This place is an awfully darn good breakfast joint that sources from locals... the last time I checked:\n\nBacon -- the Pork Shop in QC\nJams -- Cotton Country Jams\nCoffee -- C4 aka Cave Creek Coffee Company\nBreads -- MJ (drool)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	MBB is one of those places that I really like, but can't really explain why. Maybe it's the fresh jam, the perfectly cooked bacon, the cute old fashioned style of the place or  the fact that you tell yourself it just has to be great if everyone else is willing to wait in the desert for up to an hour-ish to have their hand at some..I dunno. \n\nIt is indeed tasty, and I've yet to try anything that disappoints, but the menu (in my humble o-pinion) doesn't really offer anything extraordinarily fantastic enough to warrant the wait. That said, if ever I drive by the place in the a.m. hours and happen to see that there's no line, I will consider it my lucky day and likely mosey on in.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Saw this place on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives on the Food Network and I knew I had to go if ever in the Phoenix area.\nAs luck would have it I was out there this weekend for a wedding and this place was on my must visit list. Even at 10:30am on a Friday there is a line out the door for this place. We happily waited the 30 minutes and it was well worth the wait. The husband had the pork chop and eggs served with hash browns and thick hand cut toast. I opted for the breakfast special of the day which was a hot link scramble with fresh jalapenos and cheddar served with a warm tortilla and hash browns. I will go on record as saying this is the best breakfast I have ever had. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the tortilla warm and fresh, the hash browns were crispy (not greasy) on the outside and perfect on the inside. We couldn't resist trying the pancake made from scratch as well. Fluffy and light served with warm maple syrup. YUM!  We didn't have room for all this food but we wanted to make sure we sampled all Matt's had to offer. WOW great food , excellent prices and warm friendly service. This is a must visit local breakfast joint in Phoenix.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Small cute place. Get there early or ull be waiting a long time
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Still good as ever.  They have Moved one block up so there isn't a ridiculous waiting time anymore.  I usually go by myself so always sit at the bar/counter area.  Staff is super friendly and my usual:  Waffles with bacon, OJ, and black coffee.\n\nI always end up going there after I land at the airport.  Love this place!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Amazing. Simply the BEST breakfast place in Phoenix. Always friendly staff, super fast (not the wait to get a table), the highest qualify food. It's refreshing to eat at a restaurant that clearly takes pride in the products they buy, and the flavor of the food they serve.\n\nEvery item we've tried has been beyond delicious. The only down side is the usual wait to get a table. They do a great job of being on their game, and serving quickly without making you feel like they are rushing you. This is a MUST try for any breakfast lover. Best advice: get there early, and try the griddle cakes!!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I got there at 1 on a Sunday and waited for about an hour to get seated. The place is really small so I'm sure there is always a wait. No bathroom. \n\nFood was great. Everything was really fresh. I think there were 5 things to chose from and the one thing I really wanted ran out as I ordered. Majorly bummed. \n\nI would love to come back but seriously am dreading the wait!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's is good and certainly worth doing at least once.  The food is solid to above average even if it is a little pricey for breakfast but not outrageous.  \n\nThe real draw is the location which is next to the downtown farmers market.  So on Saturday you can hit the market while waiting for your table, buy something to strengthen your locavore cred and then eat at Matt's which is a hip reclaimed location.  \n\nThen off to buy some new Steampunk junk..
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I have been told about Matt's countless times and always heard about what a tiny place it was, but until I actually went for the first time, I never got the irony in the name "Matt's Big Breakfast." \n\nI was doped up on anesthesia, so I really enjoyed sitting at the window bar so I could people watch, and so that the other patrons could not watch my weird facial expressions. \n\nFor a vegetarian, the menu did not have a huge offering, but it was a clear choice for me: egg and cheese omelet with cheddar and provolone, hash-browns, sourdough toast and coffee. \n\nUmmm... DELICIOUS!!!! Seriously, this breakfast was really awesome. I might have gained five pounds from the butter it was all cooked in, but really, who cares. \n\nThe blackberry jam they happened to be serving that day was absolutely phenomenal, and I hate jam, so you know it must have been good. \n\nI don't know if they have a bathroom but it did not appear so. As previously mentioned in probably every review and earlier in my review, this place is reallllly small. \n\nThe service was great. They served our drinks, took our order and served our food quicker than I expected, especially since the place was packed the entire time. \n\nThe only thing that kept this place from being 5 stars was the coffee. It just wasn't good. Call me a coffee snob if you must.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The first few times I went to Matt's was at the old location and I instantly fell in love.  Cozy, friendly staff and bomb a$$ food! I mean that bacon, come on!   Everything I ate was always delicious and I loved that everything was made fresh and bought local, it shows in the quality even if it is only breakfast.  \n\nUnfortunately I wasn't so impressed with the food at their new location.  Maybe I just went on an off day?! Brought a few friends with me too who have never been and got tired of me raving about the food.  Sad to say that none of them were impressed and a few said they'd probably never go back :(  \n\nPlease Matt, if you have changed anything since switching locations please stop! I loved you so very much before and now it may be a while before returning again....maybe
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	There are times when Phoenix tries my patience, event though I am here only a year.  Why, as someone else more accurately put it, are there only  two decent breakfast places?  Please, if someone knows of another, I'll be grateful for the kind referral!\n\nThe pluses:  the best home fries, real sour dough toast, very excellent marmalade\n\nThe average: decent, above average omelets and waffles, fresh butter\n\nThe minuses: the usual 30-45min wait, cramped, stuffy setting, waitresses are so busy, they bring the check right after the meal, no bathroom\n\nAll I can say is I miss real, well done home fries and crepes!  Where are you Chez Vachon?
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Fate led me to dine at Matt's Big Breakfast yesterday. We drove by this tiny restaurant while on our way to find somewhere to eat brunch. The sign indicated that they are closed on Mondays but we saw people eating inside so we sent a representative to inquire. I should note that the restaurant closes at 2:30pm and we arrived at 2:25. The waitresses were more than happy to serve us even though they were technically not supposed to be open. Score!\n\nI ordered the insider burger (not on the menu) and it was honestly one of the best burgers I have ever had! How is this possible, you ask? First off, the meat is cooked in butter. You heard me right. Butter. Second, the burger is topped with 2 eggs AND bacon. As if this weren't enough to convince you, it comes with a side of homemade chips and a pickle. Love it! I didn't even care that my face was covered in egg yolk.\n\nIf you're more in the mood for breakfast, Matt's has plenty of options. Their breakfast potatoes have the most intense rosemary flavoring, the bacon is thick and tasty and their homemade toast and jam is wonderful. Order anything on the menu and you won't be disappointed. This is a great restaurant with friendly service and awesome food.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	So....finally went.....and am graciously giving one more star. But that's about it.\n\nOf COURSE triple D keeps finding places in Arizona to broadcast shows from. Is this a big news flash or something? We should be the "Wide Load" state. Guy F happens to be a lard, so of course he's gonna B-line towards this shrinky-dinked, over-hyped and over-booked lil' nook that serves portions which could very well springboard the next season of "1000 Pound Dad".\n\nThe whole "Reality Food Show Swoops In And Makes Dining Hotspot Out Of Otherwise Run Of The Mill Establishment" is getting really, REALLY old, Phoenix! Get off your arses and find some places on your own instead of waiting for Food Network to whip you into a manufactured frenzy.\n\nI don't see the point of going, WAITING (and yes - it's true - they don't give wait times {get OVER yourselves}), and then being squished in seats and then paying for portions you can't possibly finish. How about more varied ingredients rather than a hunger-relief-in-Africa portion of potatoes on my plate?\n\nNOW I know why some Scottdalers adore and coddle this place:  It makes 'em feel adventurous. What's more edgy than coming to the semi-impoverished Roosevelt district, parking by a seedy motel (where "those" people live), gorging on local bacon and UFO size pancakes, and then safely returning home to the trials of spending the afternoon at Williams-Sonoma? Please.\n\nThe flavors are good, but not unique for breakfast. Pancakes were fluffy, but not better than my Pop's. It seems the hype is in the portions, the TV exposure, and the limited seating. People see a line and wanna go wait in it, for some reason. The food is so plain and the menu so basic that it behooves me to come to this conclusion: there's nothing new here, folks. It's breakfast. It's huge. And I couldn't care less.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I love Matt's, BUT! (read on)\n\nI love Matt's - the food is amazing! I love that Matt and his wife are so friendly and they always remember me whether I come into Matt's or The Roosevelt (granted, I AM pretty memorable).\n\nHowever...\n\nThe wait - it is out of control. Now I understand why Hawaiians hate mainlanders - because they have to wait at their favorite spots due to clueless tourists! \n\nHere is my solution, and Matt, if you read these reviews, seriously, consider what I have to say because I am in Mensa (not officially, but I would be if I took the test... I'm certain of it).\n\nSet aside a certain block of time for "LOCALS ONLY", for example, from 6:30 - 8:30 only locals are seated. How does one weed out locals from the lemmings in Tommy Bahama shirts and cameras standing outside? Easy. You must have a card that is punched each time you eat there, and once you have received 5 punches you are considered a local (granted, the first 5 times you go you will be treated like a tourist, but if it's your first time and you're a local, well hell, you're a tourist in my book). Once said card carrying local is verified as legit, he or she keeps the validated card and presents it from that time on.\n\nNow, I can already hear all the naysayers finding fault in this idea, including you Matt. But here's the truth - LOCALS keep this place humming. Tourists are one time tricks, although they do contribute to sales, it is miniscule in comparison to the long term revenue generated by Phoenicians. \n\nSo please Matt, do something that is not pc, but is good for the people that take care of you - take care of them back, get the locals in before Mr. & Mrs. Tommy Bahama. This is an amazing idea, and some restauranteur will read this and do it if you don't, so be the first, be a rebel - locals will love you for it, they will cheer your name in the streets and name their first born after you. \n\nLove, \n\nBrandon\n\n(dictated but not read)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	If you're at all a "Foodie" you can't come to Phoenix, or anywhere within 50 miles and not visit Matt's Big Breakfast.  The wait outside is just part of the ambiance and culture of this tiny little place.  I hope they don't very enlarge this place....it would so spoil it.\n\nFood....have anything.  Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness.  My personal fav's are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locally....changes frequently. \n\nThis was on Diner, Drive-ins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there.\n\nSide note...this was way cool.  On our last visit there were 4 of us, and if you've been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4.  So we're waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus, takes our orders.  When we're seated about 15 min. later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated.  Helped us get in and out and helped them move a table.  Much appreciated service.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My mom took me here this morning after I arrived on an early-morning flight, we had a craving for coffee and a new place. \nFirst impression: Small brick building by what looks like a roach motel and a parking lot totally full. Some really weird icky smell was in the air too..?\nInside is cramped with little orange tables, totally kitsch and cute. The staff were all very friendly and made sure our orders were taken as soon as we were ready, even to the point that different waitresses were asking to make sure we had coffee on the way.\nThe coffee's great and I was impressed with raw sugar on each table. \n\nThe menu is small [literally] and I ordered the cheese omelette [cheddar] with mushrooms and hash browns. The hash browns were ridiculously oily. They would have been tastier without so much grease. The omelette was mediocre and I could have made the same in my own kitchen.  The whole wheat toast was probably the best part of the meal, and the jam tasted homemade and flavourful. I am not used to really greasy food like I was served [nor did I expect it] and therefore could not get through half my breakfast before my stomach started aching. \n\nThe jist? Small cafe, great waitstaff, subpar diner food. Oh, and this might be good to know: there is no restroom in the place, so if you need to use one, you will have to go next door to that sketchy motel.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This is one of those hole in the wall restaurants you hear good stuff about and is actually true!\n\nWhen I first arrived I was a bit apprehensive having to write you name with pencil down on a piece of paper that the hostess only checked every so often. After about a 30 min wait (Saturday morning) we got a table. It is a very small place but cozy and bright as could be.\n\nFrom the coffee to the breakfast sandwich, everything was great. As long as you aren't counting calories I would recommend it to anyone.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I consider myself an expert on breakfast. I know this place is all the rave, but I think it stinks. Let me list the reasons. First, the place is tiny. Second, you can never get in. Third, the food is OK, and their soda sucks; they serve RC! Fourth, the place is always hot in the summer. Fifth, when you finally get a seat it is uncomfortable (They serve fat people food, but yet their seating is set up for a 5'1" 100 pound girl). Sixth, it is a small neighborhood place so you would think people would be nice, but they are pretty stand offish. If you have ever been to nasty truck stop (versus a good one), this is the same type of food and atmosphere. Unless you are a yuppie and looking to slum it and want to say you experienced it, I suggest skipping this place.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Yeah, Matt's definitely deserves 5-stars. \n\nDid I have to wait longer than normal for a Wednesday morning before 8 AM? Yep. But I knew ahead of time that Matt's has some hefty wait-times. (As long as I know ahead of time that I'll need to wait, I never have a problem with it.)\n\nThe service, once we were seated inside, was awesome. The waiter came over and saw that we were ready to order and didn't dally at all. He took our order and drinks at the same time. Within 10 minutes, our food was in front of us. I think that is impressive - for a place with such a long wait time, once you're inside, they get you eating as soon as possible.\n\nI had the salami scramble. I loved the huge strips of salami. The eggs were cooked perfectly - not too runny, but definitely not too cooked and dry. My friends had the chicken sausage with artichokes scramble (it was a special). They were both as happy as I was. \n\nMatt's is worth it. Go, have a great time with your friends, and eat a great breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Had great expectations after highly recommended by others. The breakfast was good, nothing extraordinary though. The service was a disappointment, server was very forgetful and put off by some simple requests. It doesn't look like they need my business though, considering the line to get in. I probably wont be back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The food and coffee were excellent. I got the breakfast sandwich, which was better than my husband's pork chop. The menu was a little ho hum, but I still would go back in a heart beat. The potatoes were very tasty. Get there early, we waited about 20 minutes or so.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ok, so here's the deal. The griddlecakes here are delicious. And I mean good. Everything else is not so good.... I found that out this morning. So we waited for awhile and were seated in the back of the little room, not the one with the kitchen. The roof was leaking right next to us from the rain last night and it kind of smelled weird. Also, the service was not so good.... we asked for cream and never got it.... asked again.... finally got it. And this coffee needs it badly... so bad. And I'm still mad they stopped serving cream and started serving some fat free garbage. So anyway, I went with the BF for breakfast and he was getting the griddlecakes and I didn't want to get the same thing as him so I ordered the salami scramble. That thing was inedible. It had so much salami that was so fatty... the only thing I could taste was fat. Not pleasant. And the salami's texture was really chewy and weird too.... the home fries that come with it are good, the toast is not so great... came with blueberry preserves which was also not great. HOWEVER, go get the griddlecakes. They are awesome. I just can't say a place is four stars when only one thing is five stars and everything else is like 2. So there ya go. Go get some of delicious grandma's griddlecakes of awesomeness. Skip everything else.\n\nUpdate: The BF and I went again today..... what a disappointment. His bacon was waaay too peppery.... like he didn't eat it, it was inedible. ugh. We waited over an hour and got seated at the counter.... pretty lame. Got the hotcakes...they were still good, but I just don't think I'll be back here anytime soon. Sorry guys.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The food's great. The pork products are amazing. The owner has a line on the best around. My gripes: the crowded conditions, the wait and, occasionally, the service, which seems to suffer because of the crowd. Two times now I've had to pull a Shirley McClaine in "Terms of Endearment" (think hospital scene and an ailing daughter needing pain medication) to get my coffee refilled even once. If Matt's has space, and that seems to occur only at opening, I'll slide in and enjoy. But I'm not going to get sunstroke for it, as great as the food is (and it is great).
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Disappointing.  I have been hearing about this restaurant for YEARS and was really disappointed.  While the quality of the food was exceptional, the dining experience was marginal.  Difficult to hear, too much traffic, too small of a location.  Clearly, this is an acquired taste by a loyal group of patrons.  Glad they use cage-free eggs!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The wait can be a bit extreme at time but if you bring a friend to talk to it helps the time pass.  However, I wouldn't recommend waiting out there in the heat if it's 100+ outside that's for sure.  As for the food, the pesto pork chops and rosemary potatoes will satisfy any man's appetite.  In general, the handful of times I have been there never disappointing but I also have never been blown out of the water either.  I will still keep going back though.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	You are in for a treat if you don't mind an hour+ wait!  Cute little place with good service. My favorite dish is the the Chop and Chick.  Definetly worth a try and if you're really lucky you might get to witness a drunken bum fight in their parking lot.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I wouldn't wait an hour in the heat, but the food is amazing, the pancakes and bacon especially, and who can fault hand-squeezed orange juice?  Come early, or in the middle of the week to avoid the crowd.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Always worth the wait. Their food is consistently delicious and the staff is fun and friendly. \n\nI highly recommend ordering the bacon- it is the best bacon I've ever had- thick and crispy. \n\nLove it!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I love going into this restaurant. A dear friend and I would go here back in the day. I hardly doubt yelpers had even yelped this house yet. It has a super special place in my heart.\n\nI ordered up the eggs and bakie. Comes with tasty hashbrowns. The sourdough toast is thick as is the bacon. The preserves were awesome. Everyone is very attentive and pretty happy.\n\nCongrats Matt on the upcoming move into the old verde house and the front room we have been enjoying breakfast in since 04 becomes Matts fast food takeout. I wish you well. And congrats on having your very own bathroom soon, lol.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'm a sucker for hash browns. And boy does this place do them right.  They are almost like a potato pancake, but even better.  Perfectly crispy, salty, greasy, but not overly greasy.  Everything else was just the cherry on top of the sundae.  Came here on Friday afternoon (around 1ish) and it was still packed.  We still had to wait about 25 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad.  The place definitely needs to bogart a few more buildings and expand.  But we sat at the counter and bar stools which made me love my hashbrowns even more.\n\nThe griddlecakes were alright.  Nothing to rave about.  The rueben was good, a little too much sauerkraut for my taste, but others loved it.  The three egg scramble looked fantastic, and by the evidence of the licked-clean plates of my friends, it was a winner.\n\nDefinitely worth a 30 minute wait in my book.  A 2 hour wait?  Eh, probably not.  Even if those hash browns are calling my name right now.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I've been coming here for a few years now and it is like coming home. I am greeted by name and the food is always great. The owners use local farm ingredients and I feel good supporting local people instead of a nameless, faceless chain restaurant.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Long wait but amazing food!!! The five spot sandwich, hash browns, and bacon was the best!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'll qualify this review up front: all I ever ask for in a breakfast is a pile of extra crispy hash browns and two to three eggs, over easy.  I put the eggs on top, dump some salt, pepper, and tabasco on there, and mix it all up.  If you learn nothing else from me, learn this: that is the way to start the day.\n\nHaving said that, damn does Matt's have some good hashbrowns and eggs.  But I give it extra credit for having delicious looking pancakes, which I've never eaten, and some really damn good honey lemonade.  I had pork chops and eggs there, and I've had the T-bone and eggs there, but the meats are really just a distraction from what I love so much.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I had high expectations after seeing them on Diner's Drive Ins and Drives, and they were exceeded!  We went at around 10:30am on a Wednesday and there was about a 30 minute wait.\n\nIt was myself, my wife, and our two kids (3 and 5).  We had a waffle, griddle cakes, and the 'Hog and Chick'.\n\nThe waffle was amazing, it went quick between the kids and my wife.  The griddle cakes were good as well, and didn't last much longer.\n\nI had the Hog and Chick with sausage patties, hash browns and wheat toast.  The sausage was great, most likely from the Pork Shop (as well as the bacon), the eggs were pefect, and the hash browns were very good as well.  Even the toast was excellent and came with local strawberry preserves.\n\nI can't wait to go back.  Once we got inside, the service was very good and quick.  We were in and out in just about an hour total, half of which was waiting outside.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My question is, if the portions were not so huge would people still be giving this greasy spoon 5 stars. I guess if you are very simple in your tastes you could give this place five stars. It is breakfast with nothing special about it except for the names on the menu. \n\nI figured it out, everybody is so goo-goo over it because its trendy! O wait maybe its because you wait outside for so long that you are even more hungover and so famished by the time you get in there that a goat turd would taste good. One more theory, the taste of the coffee made the food taste delicious. \n\nMatt is very popular in the central Phoenix area so word spread like wild fire and he has been incredibly successful by serving good quality typical greasy spoon food, and I do think it is as simple as that.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	These guys have it nailed, the breakfast is "of Champions". The fresh blueberry jam that comes with the killer fresh toast is so good I could eat it off the floor. (and possibly did cause I dropped some off my knife :). The only reason that I give them 4 instead of 5 stars is that WE GET IT you are small, you're hipster, you're non commercial...but for the love of Pete make the place a little bigger, so more than 3 people can eat inside at a time and we don't have to go on a wait EVERY time we come. But the quality is awesome.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	hmm...Well, I loved the breakfast at this adorable little joint.  Unfortunately, I am not a fan of waiting an hour and a half outside in the heat.  I also do wish they had a larger menu, but oh well.  thats what makes this place, right?  anyway, I will definitely come back again, but not if i am stuck waiting outside in the heat.  ...but i should probably get to the point.  I had the breakfast sandwhich (sorry I cant remeber its name :(  ) and my friend had just a regular belgian waffle.  both were delicious.  OH YEAH!!  and they offer fresh squeezed OJ.  that was one of my favorite parts.  When we were all said and done, we left with a $30 bill including tip.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Sooooo overrated.  I've been here three times now and this last time will be my last.  I don't mind a wait if the food and experience are worth it, but when you finally get seated at a teeny table with  not enough room for the plate, coffee cup and flatware and then the menu is limited to Denny's fare and just a hair above their quality....well, just go to Denny's.  I haven't been to Denny's in ten years; it will be longer than that before I go back to Matt's Big Breakfast.  Not a fan of greasy food.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I rarely agree with the culinary opinions of Guy Fieri, Human Cheese Fry, but I guess even a stopped clock is right twice a day.  \n\nFor about a year, I was at Matt's once a week when work would take me from North Phoenix to Tempe.  Service was nice, food was good, prices were silly, chairs were cramped, pretty much what you'd expect.  But after a while, I realized I was paying around $8 for eggs, bacon, toast and hash browns.  Sure, it was good, but it was a little much.\n\nStill, I stop by Matt's every once in a while to enjoy the food and atmosphere.  It's a great place to take your vacationing relatives, foodie friends, or other people who you wouldn't mind being crammed into a small space with.\n\nHOWEVER: If you stop by after around 7 AM on most weekdays, or at all on a weekend, be prepared to wait.  The weekend lines are ridiculous; you can hear people proudly proclaim how they woke up at 2:00 AM to drive down from Flagstaff to get the food.  Plan accordingly.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ok, first of all - if you're not up for a wait, don't go here.  Simple as that.  The place is small and it's popular - put those two facts together and there's a wait.  In the summer - yea, it's tought.  Now - that being said, I usually go to a place just down the street (don't know the name, but it's a 30 second walk to the south from Matt's) and have a bloody mary inside (or you can get coffee, juice, whatever) and do my wait there while reading the paper.  So, this works for me - no big deal.\n\nOnce seated the food is simply great.  If there's a better restaurant serving fresh, sometimes creative breakfast fare in Phoenix I'd love to know about it.  But, as a Phoenix native, I haven't found an equal yet.\n\nI usually get the "five spot".  Simple, delicious and reasonably priced.  I've had the specials from time to time and they've always been good to excellent.  The service is attentive and friendly.  And, as someone mentioned, the juice serving might be a bit on the small side - but it's always been enough for me and I'd prefer the excellent quality over 8 ounces of something average any day of the week.\n\nSo, take your favorite paper, prepare for a bit of a wait, enjoy the great weather (much of the year) and enjoy.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Greasy spoon with quality ingredients cooked to harden arteries. The service was less than stellar, but the atmosphere was cozy (read: tight) and not terribly unpleasant. The food was standard tasting - this place could do with a regular deep cleaning and perhaps some attempt to de-grease the food prep. The service could also use a bit of a boost... perhaps they should partake of their own coffee - the caffeine could help wake them up a bit.\n\nThere are some great little places like this dispersed around central Phoenix that give the downtown area some great character. This one is on the low end of the group. A few small changes and this place could easily improve to a 5 star  - but since it's so popular, there's hardly a reason to change anything I suppose. \n\nI'm thankful that I live near downtown Scottsdale where awesome breakfast choices are bountiful. Matt's is worth a visit, but only just.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I ordered 2 eggs over medium hashbrowns & the Griddle Cakes. My husband had the Classic Reuben. \n\nSERVICE - 2 stars - Waitresses were rude. And were transparently erked when we asked for Non Dairy Creamer.\nTASTE - 4 stars - Food was really good. But my eggs were over easy not over medium, the way I ordered them. \nVALUE - 1 star - they give you 2oz of syrup for an entire order of Griddle Cakes... then charge you $1.50 for every 2oz of extra syrup you order. My husbands Reuben had hardly any meat on it. \n\nOVERAll - 2.3 ... Taste was excellent but service and bang for my buck did not meet, even my most minimum of stanfards.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nWill I be going back?... probably not. \nWill I recommend to a friend... NO!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My Dad has been wanting to try this place since he saw it on the Food Network. Well, now that he's in town, he got his chance. \n\nIt's a great little place to get breakfast. And by little, I mean very little. Matt's is tiny. We went on Tuesday morning, at 10am, and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. The first thing that opened up was at the counter. If you go on Saturday or Sunday, good luck. \n\nHaving said that, everything else about Matt's is great. I had some great griddle cakes there. I didn't even have to order a side, those three pancakes filled me up for hours! My dad had the special, which was eggs, sausage, fontina cheese, and potatoes and toast. My mom had an egg and bacon and cheese Breakfast sandwich. No complaints across the board. \n\nThe staff does a great job in the small, crowded environment. Each server seamlessly tag teams you during your meal. One person took our order, another gave us our drinks, another our food, and another handled the bill. Somehow they're perfectly organized in what appears to be total chaos! \n\nI'd recommend checking Matt's Big Breakfast out sometime!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I love Matt's. I hate the wait. But if you have the patience, it's worth it. Really yummy hash browns, waffles, and I am never disappointed with their specials. Irenia is super nice and remembers her regulars which makes it feel less like a conveyer belt of customers.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I was underwhelmed with my experience at Matt's Big Breakfast, although I visited the place prompted by reviews from others.  The location is cute and the place delivers wholesome foods made with fresh, organic ingredients.  The breakfast fare here is nothing spectacular, although they do simple brunch foods well.  Don't expect anything fancy or fusion.  \n\nMy waffle was perfectly adequate, and while I thought the almost spaghetti-like hash browns were interesting/tasty, the rest of my table disagreed.\n\nStandard breakfast fare done simply, nothing to write home about.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Great, real and fresh breakfast in a super cute teeny tiny spot.  The space is so small that they don't even have a bathroom and could probably only serve 20-25 people at a time.  We waited about 15 minutes on a Thursday morning, but i would assume the wait could get scary on the weekends.\n\nThe food was totally spot on.  From the thick sliced perfectly baked bread they use for toast to the honey lemonade, all the small details take this spot to another level.  I ordered the special scramble which was ham, fresh jalapeno and cheese with a side of hash browns.  Tobin ordered the Hog and Chick (pork chop with eggs) and a side of bacon.  While the entire meal hit the spot, the hash browns were the highlight with a perfect balance of crispy top browned bits to the soft buttery layer underneath. The bacon was also legit, perfectly thick cut and cooked to perfect chewy goodness.\n\nThe staff was very friendly, quick and attentive and all seemed to thank us as we as we finished up and walked out.  \n\nThis place is a definite must see as it is everything restaurants in up-and-coming neighborhoods should be.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	It was cold for a Phoenix morning (upper 30s over-night) and I stood outside the hospital splashed in sunlight, surrounded by palm-trees and (oddly) shivering despite my wool army-drab button-down and $3 coffee. The doctor's visit went well and my spirits were high. Surgery was not an option. For now.\n\nA few minutes later, my host arrived in a green VW Rabbit. I love the new rabbits. She needed to get some work accomplished and I needed to address some email. A few (Phoenix) minutes later, we arrived at the coffee-shop. I ordered a mug of coffee and picked up a business card. Lux? That sounds familiar... Oh my goodness! LUX! I shot their first cover on top of the Smithfield at 5.30 on a Sunday morning in 2007 and the magazine was named after the coffee-shop in Phoenix where Mark and Cindy birthed the idea.\n\nThe world is tiny.\n\n---\n\n"My work is done. You wanna get breakfast?"\n\n"Do you even have to ask? What was that place you told me about before I left Philadelphia?"\n\n"Matt's. But there's another place I thought of that you might like as well."\n\n"Oh, yeah? What's that?"\n\n"The Welcome Diner."\n\n"Lemme find it on Yelp and I'll think about it."\n\n"Okay."\n\n"This is hard. I can't decide. Let's just go to Matt's. I'll do the Welcome in the Spring when I come back."\n\n---\n\nThe West is a unique place. The cities are different - spread out. The architecture is different, too. I can't describe it. It just feels like it belongs here in the desert. Form over function. Matt's fits in just this way. It's tiny inside and everything's painted white. A few photographs in white mats with white frames take up the rest of the wall space. The small bar occupies a quarter of the main dining area and four diner-orange tables decorated with desert plants take up the rest of the crowded and intimate space which is by now teeming with locals who're there to gather a late morning brunch.\n\nThere were two specials that morning and once our server mentioned the first, I couldn't remember anything else, but I told her that I needed some more time so that I could neatly arrange my table for a shot of the menu. When she came back I ordered the three-egg scramble with red peppers, spicy sausage (all their pork comes from Iowa!) and provolone cheese. A side of shredded hash-browns accompanied this beautiful breakfast feast.\n\nFor a joint that stays as busy as it does, the prices are fantastic. (I think everything's cheaper in Phoenix). Before tip, my tab was right around $12 and for the quality and quantity of food that I received in one of Phoenix's most popular spots, I had no complaints.\n\nWhen I make a return visit to the Valley of the Sun in April, I'll be sure to make myself an out-of-town-regular at this wonderful little place.\n\n...And maybe next time I'll run into Nate Ruess.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I have a unique appreciation for smaller, urban, phoenix based spots.  Matt's Big Breakfast was recommended from a few people in my building.  I went there a few days ago and the wait was atrocious.  When I got to my table I was given a menu.  The food seemed fairly common and nothing stuck out.  The waiter seemed too involved with tasks that I assume far surpassed customer satisfaction in importance.  At best, this was a drawn out version of an old, unmaintained, dirty Denny's.  I will not return.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Be prepared for a very very very long wait and don't come hungry. What? Don't come hungry when you're coming out to eat breakfast? Exactly! Wait time may be 2-3 hours so please do yourself a favor and snack or eat light before you come. So what tempted a Tempe girl to come out to Phoenix to eat at Matt's Big Breakfast...Triple D DUH! Haha...Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives with Guy! He's the man! Who doesn't love him? I'm sure many people are stalking his eating stops. So cool, they have his face stenciled on the wall. \n\nOkay, so you get here and it's so teeny tiny that there's just a little stool with a waiting list. Write your name down and feel free to take off for a bit. Walk around downtown...bring board games...don't plan on just waiting outside because #1. There may not be anywhere to sit and #2. Your bottom will be very sore from sitting so long. This restaurant is in an old lobby of an old motel. You know, the old motels with the little detached lobby the size of a one car garage. I would not recommend bringing a group here...they will not be able to fit you. If you're not up for the experience but would like to try the food, they do have carry-out as an option and it will probably only take 15 minutes or so. Once you finally get seated you can't help but wonder, how oh how do these people work in this tiny room all day? Man! It is t-i-n-y! Okay, so now that I have stressed how small this place is (tiny) lets move on. :-) I ordered what Guy ordered, The Chop and Chick. A pork chop with eggs. It comes with toast and your choice of hash browns or home fries. The chop was smaller, not life changing, but very tasty...it had great seasoning. Only $8 too. Home fries were a five out of five. Very good! No soda machine here...they sell RC Cola by the can though. $1.25 a can...My Dad had the griddle cakes and he said that they were the best pancakes he's ever had. So funny because we talked to a waitress and she said it's just a regular batter but my dad is a pancake connoisseur and he loved them! Overall, yummy food, great prices but the wait is just way too long to make this a regular spot. I would eat here again but would definitely take it to go...maybe even eat outside where everyone's been waiting for hours.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I love breakfast food. Usually there are great options for non-meat eaters. But this is really a meat-eater's breakfast paradise. We realized during the long (1  1/2 hour) wait that we would have limited offerings, but everyone leaving assured us it was worth the wait and it was too late to get breakfast someplace else. \n\nMatt's served the hottest, best tasting scrambled eggs, amazing coffee and some pretty good pancakes.  My companion ordered the tuna sandwich. Good, but not worth the wait. Four stars for the food, minus the wait and the choices.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Small seating area, long wait. Bathroom was in motel next door. But the food is excellent, definitely worth the wait. Good prices. Currently, my favorite breakfast experience in downtown Phoenix.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Went here after seeing it on DDD. The waffle and bacon were amazing! Got there right before the rush (Sat around 8am) so we didn't have to wait. They don't have tables big enough for 4 (it's a smallllll place) so we sat at the counter. Everyone's food was great. ONLY problem was for some reason, the waitress refused to give my husband water. I say "refused" because it turned into a joke but he asked her like 4x and still didn't get water.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Worth the wait! The food is big and yummy in this tiny little restaurant! The owner was there and was very nice!! The waffle was great and the bacon was awesome!! I will come back the next time I'm in phoenix!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ooh, I can help push Matt's to past 100 reviews! \n\nBefore, I only got stuff by takeout because the wait was just too much. This morning, decided to just suck it up. The fact that the downtown farmer's market is right across the street helps. I recommend signing the wait list before you're actually hungry and go check out all the local vendors.\n\nI previously had the hog and chick with "off-the-bone ham." Mmmm....the ham is always flavorful and just the right amount of tender. I love how the toast is actually hunks of sourdough or wheat rolls with jam that's not a little Smuckers packet. Back to what I ate this trip, I finally had their Belgian style waffle. It was bordering on perfect--crispy in all the right places and steaming and soft inside. I love how they serve the syrup warm. The bacon was thick but not too dense. And the freshly squeezed orange juice of course complemented it all. Hard to believe that they don't add any sugar to the juice. I like how the hash browns aren't greasy like what you'd get at IHOP or Denny's. \n\nThe staff are quite friendly and make sure you've been attended to. The atmosphere in the little red brick house is a jovial neighborhood diner feel. Our wait was not quite half an hour but that's after we returned from the farmer's market to check on our wait. Time it all before you're actually starving and you'll be good.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This is the best breakfast joint in the valley of the sun.   I have been here many times and the average wait time is about an hour.... but is totally worth it!\n\nFood:  The food here is great!  Everything is freshly made and full of favor!  My favorite is their pork chop with eggs... and you must get their rosemary home fries and wheat toast!   Also thick cut bacon as a side!  The bacon is what keeps bringing me back to this place.   They are thick cut and peppered... 3 slices for $2.95 might be a little pricy but they are really good!  \n\nTheir daily specials are also very good, most of the time is some type of egg/ sausage scramble.\n\nI also love their homemade bread and jam.  Matt's switches up their jam favors.\n\nService:  Their staff is great!  Very friendly and attentive.  But you must prepare to wait... the only time that I didn't have to wait was when I got there 10 mins before opening.   Otherwise prepare to wait at least 1 hour.   They new location is more than twice the size of the old location, but wait time is still very long, especially you have a large group.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Breakfast - the most important meal of the day and the best, especially if you get it at Matt's!\n\nMy biggest dilemma at Matt's is only solved by deciding I can take home what I don't eat and enjoy it later.   Plus, I have to say no whenever I can to their yummy organic chocolate milk which fills me up before my food even comes.   It is truly hard for me not to get their omelets which are extraordinary.  I get basic ham and cheese and the buttery goodness of the eggs along with the "real" ham just make any other omeletes I have had just average eggs.  Then there is the frantic moment when the server needs to know if I want home fries or hash.    Ack!  Both are the best although I have figured out that I can take the home fries home pop them in a pan the next day and my house smells like Matt's and the potatoes make everything I make to go with them taste even better.\n\nThey have scrambles on the special board that often tempt me away and the beauty is that they put in what is fresh at that moment.  Everything at Matt's is fresh and they only use the very best.  My other addiction is to their pancakes which just blow my mind.  No matter what we get I tend to get one on the side to share with my husband as while I don't want to get just pancakes I can't turn it away.\n\nThe most incredible thing I have ever had there is the Huevos Rancheros.  I even had my name put on a list to be notified when they have them and short of a 3 hour drive back into town I will get to Matt's when they call!\n\nMy husband is a true blue chop and chick fan.  He can rarely leave the pesto crusted pork chop to order other things, and then he proceeds to nibble every bit off the bone which he assures me is the whole point of the bone.  He also scores my jam as I am not a jam person and according to him and everyone else it is awesome.  I have bought it at the market from the makers as gifts.  The jam goes on the bread which is another treat altogether. Sliced thick and perfectly buttered it also is good the next day.\n\nYes the wait is evil but you just have to manage it.  There is no doubt we don't go as often as we would if it were not long.  It is hard to go on most weekends as it is a 3 hour chunk out the day (for us drive time, wait time, and yummy time), but on Saturday's you can put your name on the list visit the market and return to find yourself top of the list.  Don't fear missing your turn for if you mark down you are going to the market they will put you back at the top of the list when you return if they already called for you.  My husband also ventures there during the week as a single and says he is seated within 15 minutes any time.  Please note he is a cruel man and he is told to keep his trap shut about these solo visits as my food envy thunders in.\n\nIt is a no brainer 5 star adventure at Matt's.  If the food didn't melt my brain with sensory happiness the adorable picture of the owners' son on the wall certainly gets my heart.  Matt and Erenia keep up the great work (and the cute aprons :-))!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I was afraid this place would be overrated, because most breakfast places are. I usually think, how hard is it to cook up some eggs? and most places can't cook pancakes and waffles better than my mom. I was very wrong, this place was so, so, sooooo good. I had the salami egg scramble with hash browns, everything was cooked perfectly. The toast that came with fresh preserves and butter was amazing! My husband had the waffle with REAL maple syrup (a requirement in my mind) and sorry mom, but this one was actually better than yours. With the waffle came a side of the thickest, most flavorful bacon I've ever had. I would come back here for the bacon alone! This place is well worth the wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	DO NOT MISS Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix. Here's the deal, saddle up to the breakfast bar & get set for a terrific breakfast, served by FUN, attractive servers. Matt only seats about 35 customers, so be patient, you'll be rewarded. If you have some flexibility, stop in around 9:15 AM Monday thru Thursday, often times you can get seated with no waiting. A local favorite & well known throughout Phoenix...FUN !!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What can I say That Ayesha didn't already cover? I love breakfast..and I love butter. Breakfast + butter + more butter = Matt's. \n\nI had an omelette which was filled with delicious cheese and as Ayesha mentioned the mushrooms had been cooked up in butter before going into the mix which is how I do it at home. The eggs were fluffy and delicious. The toast was thick. THICK. \n\nYes the wait was long. The windows are huge so you can make those already eating uncomfortable by staring at them as they eat which is sort of fun right?\n\nThe shooting pain in my left arm makes it hard to type, but with the smile on my face I am forced to try to put out this one last review before my early death to butter clogged arteries. \n\nThey also got a boost when on the way out every single staff member shouted to us thank yous, and have a good days, and come back soons. Sweet folks. I will have to go back after the bypass surgery.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I grew up in AZ and did not know about this place until just recently from a friend's recommendation. This is the greatest hole in the wall breakfast I have ever had! Be prepared to wait or make sure to go grab a coffee so you are ready for the 45 minutes you have ahead of you. Also, you write your name on the list yourself outside (we were newbe's and a few skipped in front of us on the list because we were too timid to write ourselves at first until we knew it was the norm). Got the special scramble and the waffle and would recommend both again. Above all though, make sure you try the honey lemonade! It is made with local honey and has the pulp from the lemon in there to show you how real it is. Will be back soon, the service was great as well :)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Before flying out of Phoenix, we decided to fuel up by having breakfast here.  We were drawn to the location based on the number of reviews.   So, we decided to give it a try.  \n\nWe ate in their new location, apparently, the restaurant was down the block and about 1/2 the size it is now. \n\nThe staff/workers all welcomed us with friendly chat.  They all sported vans, skinny jeans, t-shirts and a zip up sweat shirts.  The industrial like environment made conversations bounce off walls which caused it to be loud and sometimes difficult to hear.  But, it was clean and service was FAST!\n\nI ordered the breakfast special.  Our waiter praised the deliciousness of their french toast and apple smoked sausage.  Wow, was he correct.  The french toast was incredible.  The sausage was good.  I normally do not eat pork products anymore, so my rating of "good"; I am sure does not do it justice.\n\nMy husband does not eat pork products, so when we asked about alternatives like chicken sausage, turkey bacon or Soy; they did not have any.  So, his breakfast choice immediately became limited.  He ordered the cheese omelet.  It was filled with mushrooms, and red peppers.  Potatoes and a side of bread accompanied his dish.\n\nThe coffee was not bad; but at the same time left us not thrilled about it either.  So, we strolled a few blocks down to buy some strong brewed Starbucks coffee.\n\nWe enjoyed our experience.  If we lived in Phoenix, I am sure we'd eat there again.  However, on our next visit; we'll probably choose another place with meat alternatives and more green chile.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Saw it on TV and had to check it out while in town. Had the waffle with bacon, all great. Wife had the salami scramble with sourdough toast. Some of the best toast I have ever had. Everything I saw looked great and the owners were both there, always a good sign. There was a wait and parking can be hard, but if you want a good breakfast in Phoenix this is the spot. Next time I am in Phoenix I will be going back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This was a case of high expectations falling short. After seeing it on a Food Network show and reading about it in numerous sources, I had high hopes for Matt's Big Breakfast. After waiting for 45 minutes, we made it inside the tiny restaurant.  \n\nEverything was ok, but nothing spectacular. I do appreciate their no microwave, no freezer rule, but I feel it didn't live up to the hype I had read/heard about. \n\nMaybe I'm just spoiled by good Bay Area coffee options, but the coffee here was BAD. The salami scramble was pretty average and the Belgian waffle for which a lot of people rave about, was fine, but again, didn't stand out as amazing. The thick cut bacon was awesome and a nice accompaniment to the waffle. \n\nHowever, waiting for 45 minutes and feeling rushed to get out the door, just isn't worth it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	They have a new location just up the street from the old one and this one has BATHROOMS - YEAH!!\nFood here is AS GOOD AS IT GETS, you can't find better food in this town AT ANY PRICE.  We are huge fans, love that BIG BUTTER BURGER and the GRIDDLE CAKES.  We drive 100 miles round trip to get this food and it's WORTH it.\nCongrats, Erenia and Matt - LOVE the new place!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Food was pretty good, although watch what you order "à la carte". It will add up FAST!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Awesome! \n\nOn Saturday, get there as early as possible, put your name down on the list and walk over to the farmer's market for a quick look around and you'll be back in time to get your table... Food's great, service is quick and the prices are reasonable... Love this place!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I had breakfast here yesterday morning - early on a weekday with one of my best friends, and had no waiting time.  It was a really nice meal and the staff was really pleasant.  The decor is a little too bright for this early morning wanderer.  I'm not a morning person - I need time to wake up & charge up for the day.  I don't suggest this place for any more than 2.  I suggest avoiding the crowds and going early so that the experience isn't tainted.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I don't think I have anything to share that hasn't already been posted in previous reviews.\n\nThe food here is stellar - quality ingredients, great flavor, and nothing cookie-cutter. The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. Service is friendly, quick, and everything one should expect.\n\nI absolutely love visiting this place and encourage you to do so, as well, if you haven't already. I am one of the lucky ones who has never had to wait more than 60 seconds for a table - I'm not sure how that's worked out, but it has, and I'm grateful. That said, I would gladly wait an hour to enjoy some great breakfast fare at Matt's. I'm looking forward to trying lunch one day, too!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Another downtown joint I hadn't bothered reviewing because it's such a part of my regular routine.\n\nI love hash browns and Matt's is a hash brown lover's paradise. I don't know exactly how they cook their eggs; I just hope that whatever they do, they keep doing it. It's tasty. \n\nI have friends from Tucson who crash at my place on an occasional weekend, and every Sunday morning before they head back to the Old Pueblo, they insist on my taking them here. They're as addicted as I am. \n\nLong lines on Sunday mornings so expect a wait and bring good conversation topics with you.\n\nNOTE: MrK took some great shots of the place that you can see above. His last interior shot does indeed have Matt in the background, and the very cute Gretel toward the right (she also waitresses at the Roosevelt).
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Believe it or not, I finally had my first Matt's experience this morning... I'd been hearing about Matt's Big Breakfast for ages, but never really wanted to make the drive to wait forever just for a greasy breakfast!\n\nHowever, we were talked into Matt's by some friends of ours that were also Matt's virgins... we met there around 10am, only to find that there were about 2 full pages worth of names ahead of us, and that they would not quote a wait... Matt's was smaller than I imagined, so I knew it would take awhile.  We debated going elsewhere and even went over to The Turf for coffee.  (If the service there were better there, we probably would've just stayed there, but we figured if we were going to wait, we'd just wait for Matt's).  My pregnant friend went into Matt's at one point to use the bathroom and they told her she had to go to the hotel nextdoor and 'ask for Mike.'  That was a bit shady...\n\nAbout an hour and a half later, our party of four was seated... and needless to say, we were all starving by then!  We started with some fresh squeezed OJ and coffee.  (The OJ glasses were tiny, but each sip tasted like heaven... and I was pleased to see that they use coffee fresh from Cave Creek Coffee Co.)\n\nWhen it was time to order, I was extremely disappointed that after that long wait, they were out of whole wheat toast.  I ended up getting an egg white omelette (yes, they do egg whites), hashbrowns, sour dough toast + preserves.  I could eat only about half of it... but what I did eat was good, greasy, and filled me up for most of the day.\n\nI don't really see myself rushing back to Matt's again anytime soon - unless it's on a weekday when the wait isn't so bad.  But I will say I'm happy that I finally made it to Matt's - and oh, what an experience it was!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Dunno if you can really call it a big breakfast, but it's usually a good breakfast.\nSeems like it's a scratch cooked kitchen because the food seems so fresh and tasty.\n\nWe liked the salami scramble with the fresh baked wheat toast,, it works well.\n\nSweet as sugar, attractive waitresses who are appreciative of their customers and seem to be right there for ya. They always remember you.\n\nBeware that you are charged for all drink re-fills except coffee, and they may not mention it to you,, and suddenly your bill doubles.\n\nYeah,,, you have a wait, even for the 5 seat counter,, and sometimes they'll seat an employees family member way ahead of you,, and sometimes forget to check the sign-in list and customers are left stranded outside and ignored,, that really sucks.\n\nIf ya feel un-loved outside sitting on the on deck bench, perhaps peek inside and remind them someones waiting.\n\nBring quarters for the parking meters. A buck fifty an hour.\n\nCramped and uncomfortable seating throughout. No place for a fat man,, non-fat only.\n\nOpens at 6:30 AM and they usually call it a day roughly around 2:30 PM.\nClosed Mondays last we rolled through.\n\nI like almost everything on the menu, though it seems when a good food place gets national media attention, their quality thus backs into hell. \n\nWe'll see with Matts.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Great classic breakfasts, nothing fancy but very fresh and very good. I'm coming back!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Bacon O' Bacon!!! This place was one of those random "let's see what's good in this area" excursions. WOW. I was excited by the reviews and the fact that it was featured on DDD (secret foodie mission of mine is to try EVERYTHING on DDD). Well, it was worth the wait and had the best bacon I have ever tried! They were quick and attentive once inside. HOWEVER, I did wait for over an HOUR on a half broken milk crate I turned up-side down, outside in the JULY 100+ degree weather. They had one bench that seated four with some shade and the rest were out in the open. They do have a crowd and I understand a wait for good food but, it was uncomfortable. They also have an honor system scratch pad under a paper weight, that is barely monitored and I saw a few people try to sneak their names on! Thankfully, people who are hungry are ruthless and they didn't get very far! A hostess would help IMMENSELY or a police officer in case a fight breaks out ;)... \n\nOVER ALL- once I was inside, it was a good experience, fresh food, cozy atmosphere and great service!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I miss Matt's!  I haven't been able to find decent, let alone great breakfast in LA. \n\nWhat I like:\n- The coffee.  Seriously people. What are you bitching about the coffee for?  I'm guessing most of you are Starbuck's frequenters that think over-roasted burnt beans = delicious coffee? That a macchiato is really a sugary drink with lots of milk?  That drinking a coffee concoction containing 1000+ calories daily is good for you?  That's what I thought.\n- The daily specials.  The bacon, spinach and cheese omelet they do sometimes is amazing.  If you are *lucky* enough to walk in on the rare occasion they are making French toast, well then you had better order it while you can.  Best freakin' French toast I've ever eaten!\n- The ingredients.  Fresh, local and organic.\n- The staff.  They are awesome.  Enough said.\n- The size.  I like the fact that it is small and quaint and that you can peer at your neighboring table's order.  And even say hello...try making a new friend instead of whining.  \n- The prices.  Perfect.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- That it is in Phoenix and not LA.\n\nTips:\n- Don't bring your kids. \n- Order your hash browns well done.  They are PERFECT that way.\n- If you aren't a fan of waiting a little bit, go to Denny's.  Or go early!\n- Don't go to a diner if you only eat health food.  It's not called Matt's Granola & Fruit Bar.....
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Want a simple breakfast without doodads and sprinkles? Hate when people come clapping by your table to sing Happy Birthday to little Timmy in the booth behind you when all you want is some f-ing breakfast and coffee? Matt's is the place for you. \n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Amy D for lunch here a while back. I must say I was seriously surprised how simple everything was. I don't know what I was expecting, but this is a pretty straightforward breakfast joint. For my breakfast, I had bacon, eggs, hash browns and 1 pancake that was large enough for two. I washed it all down with their honey sweetened lemonade, which I thoroughly enjoyed! \n\nSo why three stars? First of all, a three star rating is NOT a bad rating. Second, it's breakfast. There really is no way to mess up a simple breakfast. I definitely will go back to try their burgers and maybe I'll boost my rating. \n\nMatt's is A-OK in my book and I look forward to going back!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I visited a friend in Phoenix. She knew I was a breakfast buff so she took me to Matt's Big Breakfast since it was so well known around the city and the country. I enjoyed my meal but "big breakfast" was a bit misleading.\n\nFor starters, I thought the breakfast menu was particularly small and the options on the menu were strange. There was a breakfast sandwich, cheese omelet, pork chop and eggs, pancakes, salami scramble, waffle, oatmeal and frosted flakes. Yes, you could order frosted flakes for $4.50. Why? I don't know. Nothing really appealed to me on the menu which was strange.\n\nI chose eggs over easy, bacon and hashbrows with toast. The bacon was phenomenal. This may have been the best bacon I've ever had. The hash browns were thinly shredded and very crispy but not burned in the slightest. The toast was thick and chewy with homemade jam. Everything I ate was excellent.\n\nThe service was atrocious. I ordered a coffee. I got one cup which was luke warm. I asked for a refill but that refill never came. I asked for water and that didn't arrive until the end of the meal. No one checked on us after we got our food. \n\nI heard they moved to a new place which is nice, industrial and modern inside (think Chipotle) but it's small. The lay out is also stupid and there is a lot of wasted space. \n\nEven at 9am there was a 1/2 hour wait to eat. I don't know if it's worth it. The food is excellent and well prepared but the rest is a bit of a mess. The menu may be small but it's all done well. I don't think I'd wait very long to eat here again. I've had better breakfast in Phoenix and I'd go there instead.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	yep, good ol' simple home cooking, and by 'home cooking' i mean back when no one cared that there was about three cups of butter in per serving.\n\nif you've never gone, don't be scared off by all the butter references, it's not that bad. the place is teeny tiny, and our table of two had to wait about 10 minutes for a place, parties of more than four, you'll probably have to get split up. \n\nthe omelettes are wonderful, and the rosemary home fries are too good. the bacon is so good.. i can't even describe it. let me stress i am NOT a pork fan, and rarely eat it. i never eat bacon from a restaurant since i'm so picky about it. everyone raved about it here, so i dived in and thought, 'what have i been missing my whole life?' ha ha, yeah, i has an awakening of pork love right in the middle of the joint! seriously, it's unbelievable.\nit's worth the trek no matter where you're coming from, especially on a sat morning. afterward we checked out a small famer's market that was going on right up the street, and then popped in Circles records and tapes, also within walking distance.\n\n***Update 3/8\nI just went over the weekend and we waited more than 45 minutes. i was ok with it, but i was with someone who does not really place value on waiting a little longer for great food, which kind of put a damper on things. def do not bring someone here who is not willing to wait for a good thing.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I had their belgian waffle, which came with bacon and advertised real cream butter and real maple syrup. Also got orange juice and my girlfriend got a salami-egg scramble thing.\n\nThe lady's salami-egg scramble was great (and a new taste!) but my waffle was THE BEST WAFFLE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I sipped my tiny $2.50 (I think) orange juice and FELL OFF MY CHAIR, AMAZED BY THE DELICIOUSLY SWEET FRESH SQUEEZED OJ.\n\nAfter being revived by my frantic girlfriend, I quickly JUMPED UP AND HUGGED EVERY EMPLOYEE IN THE BUILDING.\n\nTrue story.\n\nWe went at 1:30 PM on a Sunday and sat right down-- your mileage may vary as this place is apparently legendary and I hear can attract quite a crowd when busy. There's like 10 small tables in the whole place plus a bar, and virtually no parking, and no shade, so don't expect to be catered to (outside of delicious food.)\n\nAlso, Matt has inspired a new invention: fresh squeezed orange juice shots. Seriously, I'd buy a few if they existed.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Went to matt's the other day to see what the rave is about and just as I expected nothing but self perpetuated hype with the help of the food network nothing more. The service was ok the coffee nothing special and my hog and chick was very unremarkable at best. It was not that the food was bad, however, if you can't be seated right away it's not worth the wait. This is not a special place. No gem to find her just pricey breakfast food and there are other choices that you can do better with. I saw a guy paying for his breakfast using three different credit cards....I mean what did he eat? And how much did it cost!!!!?? Anyway, if you are into over hyped breakfast joints and food that is mediocre at best then you may like matt's. Nothing against them but you guys are not all that when it comes to what you serve and your 15 minutes of fame has long been expired. Making people wait to eat here is nothing more then for show..trust me this is my review and I was seated right away just imagine if I had to wait in line what the review would say. Save your money and look elsewhere for the start of your day. I give matt's 5 stars for boring me with their breakfast and coffee and I give them another 5 stars for being able to convince people to pay over five dollars for a lacluster breakfast which amounts to culinary rape of one's taste buds. Do yourself a favor when you pass by this \nplace and your hungry just drive past and go to any other nearby spot that won't   Molest your good senses.\n\nTo make it you have to rely on your food and staff........not guy fieti and the food network!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Contrary to the reviwers below...I love Matt's. Yeah the wait is long...the place is small...once I went in the summer and I was sweating in my coffee...\n\nBUT....\n\nThis is Phoenix people. When the breakfast choices are a tasty meal at Circle K (heated under heat lamps) or Denny's and IHOP, you can't beat Matt's. \n\nI love breakfast. I eat breakfast everywhere I travel on business. I have never had a better breakfast than at Matt's. Fresh ingredients, great food, excellent bread and jam...kick $ss hashbrowns.\n\nI wish the place was bigger (and cooler) and the wait not so long. But as a special breakfast treat...you can't beat it.  Just bring your own fan.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Overrated, overrated, overrated.\n\nThe food was OK, the service sucked, they don't have ranch dressing, and they don't  have any restrooms on site... which is unacceptable in my opinion.\n\nAfter waiting over an hour and listening to all the people raving about how good the food was outside, I had high hopes. My over easy eggs were soupy, more like under easy, nasty, and the guy next to me complained hes eggs were soupy as well. Something as simple as eggs should be cooked to perfection if this place was so good. The bacon and ham were pretty good, but nothing extra ordinary. The hash browns were soaked in butter and cooked with some short of pepper mix that tasted like crap. The pancakes were just pancakes with maple syrup, tasted exactly like pancakes from crackle barrel, whatever. The only thing at this place I can honestly say was the best I've ever had was the whole wheat toast. \n\nThe food was ok. If their wasn't a wait it would be worth eating at, but other then that, places like Chompies and The Breakfast Club are far superior.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Midwestern hipster breakfast of champions - that's how I would describe it in 5 words.  \n\nGood down-home breakfast, but not for weight watchers.   Bright orange formica counters and rooster orange juice glasses.  Love that the place is smaller than a shoebox.  It means you have wait ahead of you, but it keeps the breakfast experience a friendly intimate one. \n\nThe hog and chick is what I usually order. But most recently I've been ordering the sopressata salami scramble with provolone and the five spot breakfast sandwich.  The burger buns are a lackluster choice, but the grilled onions and thick peppercorn bacon slices more than make up for it.  The hash browns can be a bit greasy, but hey, that's what happens when you cook with butter.  \n\nCan be a wait on weekend, but worth it in central Phoenix, especially when the Good Egg and other places get old.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The food tastes amazing. I don't want to know how much butter they used to make my waffle, but I sure made it disappear. The staff is intelligent, friendly and efficient. There is sometimes a wait to eat here, but they have a waiting list and try to get new customers in quickly. I have eaten here twice this school semester (it's very close to the ASU downtown Phoenix campus) and I keep talking new classmates into going back with me. The ingredients are fresh and very high quality. No wonder they were featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive- ins and Dives. Yum! Try the omelet, it's my favorite.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Outstanding food.  Get over the wait people.  That's what happens in a desperate-for-culture town like Phoenix gets a few good places to eat.  You think they complain about this in cities that have a soul?   The waffle-outstanding.  Hashbrowns- best ever.  Bacon-great.   Its local, its fresh and its unique.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I know this isn't going to sit well with a lot of Yelpers, but I was markedly underwhelmed by Matt's.  I had high expectations considering the avid reviews (and the feature on the Food Network), but frankly, I was disappointed.\n\nI was expecting quite the wait to be seated considering the popularity of the place (and the line when I got there), but since I was dining alone, I was seated immediately.  Unfortunately, my seat was at a bar along a window that faced the hot Arizona sun.  I had to wear sunglasses while dining.\n\nI started with a cup of coffee.  It was fresh, but not particularly flavorful.  Anyway, that's not really where I'm hung up on this place.  What do you expect for a buck thirty-five?  No, my issue was with my food.\n\nHere's what I ordered: a Salami Scramble (basically scrambled eggs with salami) and a side of bacon.  The Salami Scramble was served with hash browns and toast.  The biggest disappointment of the meal was easily the Salami Scramble.  Having read good things about the entree, and upon recommendation of my server, I was excited to try the scramble.  Unfortunately, the scramble failed to live up to the hype. While the eggs were cooked perfectly (not too rubbery and not too runny), the overall flavor was off-putting.  The salami tasted okay, but in conjunction with the eggs, and the overpowering use of herbs, the final product was less than delicious.  Even after slathering the whole thing in catsup and hot sauce, the herbal and earthy overtones were overpowering.  I had the same problem with the hash browns: they were entirely overpowered with herbs.  I found myself actively trying to pick out the rosemary permeating the potatoes.\n\nAs far as the bacon goes, it was undercooked.  I like my bacon relatively crispy, perhaps more than others, but still, this was very chew.  The toast was fine.\n\nBecause of how much positive buzz this place has I may try it again - perhaps I was the victim of a rare poorly prepared meal here.  As it stands now, though, I'm less than enthused.\n\nLay off the herbs - they're best used sparingly.  They're potatoes, not a salad.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ok. I started coming here when Matt could only get the local downtown area news channel to cover his place. It was only open for about 2 weeks and you could walk in at the height of the lunch hour and grab a table or spot at the bar. That was then and the food "F" rocked! Ok flashed forward to present day! Service is still pretty good, the wait can be a bit long, the food now is just ok. It has lost it's charm a little. Menu is sit short. If you are in the area and can afford to kill 30 minutes for a spot then check it out.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Another breakfast in the books, thanks in part to yelp and the devoted food review culture. Upon arrivng at Matt's Big Breakfast, the line is insanely intimidating. If we weren't so far out of Scottsdale, I'm not sure my girlfriend and I would have withstood the wait. Boy were we happy with our decision to stay. The wait lasted about 45 minutes and we were in and out of the restaurant in about a half hour. I ordered the Five Spot sandwich and my beautiful girlfriend ordered the pork chop meal. We both had water with our meals and the total cost was $19.06. The wait staff is fairly attentive, nice, and very efficient. Unfortunately, we buffered the wait with coffee drinks from Royal at the Market coffee, located just down the street, and they told us at Matt's that outside drinks are not allowed which kinda sucked being that we just waited for 45 minutes in the hot sun. At this point, our expectations were very high and we were a little irritated by the wait, therefore the food had to deliver BIG...and it pretty much did. My sandwich was on a great brioche bun that was loaded with cheese, sunny side up egg, and two great slices of bacon. I also ordered a side of homefries which were perfectly seasoned with herbs and grilled onions. We both agreed the homefries rocked. My grilfriends pork chop was fried and came with this interesting light basil pesto shmear that was perfect. Her eggs were scrambled and the hash brown potatoes were more like a potatoe pancake and she liked it. Her dish also came with local sourdough toast and a great mixed berry jam. Nothing in this meal was cooked bad or served cold. We will probably return again as long as the temperature outside permits. One last FYI: Beware showing up in large groups.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'm sure it's excellent -- but after waiting on line for 30 minutes on a Saturday morning, we sat down and realized that their menu is pretty small, and almost all dishes contain some sort of pork. That narrowed our choice to pretty much pancakes (just say "killing me softly with your buttah.."), so we bolted -- to Palatte. \n\nI'm sure it's great if you like good ol' home cookin' diner food, but for this New York food snob, the choices are too few to wield my wallet.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What I Ate\n- waffle\n- bacon\n- 2 scrambled eggs\n- hashbrowns\n- glass of milk\n\nWould I Go Again?\nYes--I had a fantastic breakfast at Matt's.  I asked the waitress what are the most popular items on the menu, and one of the items she listed was the waffle.  The waffle was so good!  The batter was great, it was cooked perfectly, and the sweet cream butter and maple syrup completed the waffle's deliciousness.  The hashbrowns are my all-time favorite hashbrowns!  No competition.  The eggs were good (hard to go wrong with scrambled eggs), and the thick bacon was delicious.  Big thanks to Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives for helping me find this little gem in Phoenix!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	REAL food (not the processed crap you find at Denny's).  Super friendly and fast service.  Family owned and operated.  Local ingredients  Great portions.  What more can you ask for?  Oh, maybe a few more tables to shorten the wait.  But that's all part of the charm!  This is my pick for the best breakfast in Phoenix!\n\nSOOOOO delicious!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's new location is bigger, but they have preserved the ambiance that makes Matt's a breakfast destination.  It doesn't matter how big they make the diner; there will always be a line to get in there!  The simple secret is the fresh, real ingredients they use, locally-sourced whenever possible.  When you're a regular, they know your name and your order.  Big plus, in my book, is the new digs have a bike rack.  LOVE Matt's Big Breakfast!  It truly is as good as it gets.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Go Early or be prepared to wait!  Smallest restaurant ever.  SUPER good food!  I've tried almost everything on the menu.  I've enjoyed it all.  They also have fresh squeezed juice and rosemary potatoes and an interesting bread when they don't have sourdough.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'm not sure why everyone loves this place.  Maybe it's the gigantic portions of meat they serve.  I was not impressed by the veggie section of the menu...oh wait, there's not one...and no, I don't like oatmeal or f-ing grapefruit for breakfast.  ick.  I've waited in line once--that'll be enough for me, Matt.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place was featured in Food Network and since I was in town, I thought I'll give it a try.  I got there around 12pm (rush hour) and waited 45 minutes for a table.  The staff was very friendly and helpful but super busy.  \n\nCoffee was your typical coffee, nothing special there.  The salami scramble was to die for, the flavor was amazing!  The waffles were awesome, so fluffy and soft.  The bacon was thick but it was too burnt for my preference.  The fresh jam on the thick white toast was delicious!  \n\nOverall, the food was excellent and it was worth the 45 minutes wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	First off, we went with a group of six on a Tuesday morning at 10:30am and STILL had to wait about 45 minutes for two tables of 3.  BUT, the food was worth the wait as I had the delicious special with jalapeno and sausage scrambled, with hash browns and a fresh tortilla.  Awesome!  Great coffee too!  In fairness the line moves pretty fast, but this is a small place so if you're considering coming with a big group, be forewarned that you'll wait longer for a table together.\n\nWe also learned while we were eating that Matt's was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network.  So that may be the reason for the business too...fewer locals and more looky-loos.\n\nRegardless, I'd go back in a flash and highly recommend Matt's!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	EVERYONE hyped this place up waaaaay too much. I waited with 2 friends for 1.5 hours. I got a Cheese/Sausage omelet with grilled onions... it came with a piece of toast, 2 eggs (I think), and hash browns.\n\nPeople seem to talk about the hash browns... I don't see whats so special. Shredded potato that's burnt on the top and bottom, while hella soggy in the middle... is not my idea of damn good hash browns.\n\nIn my honest opinion, if you like A LOT of butter on everything, as well as waiting in line for a hour and a half, for a chance to sit down in a crazy small restaurant... then this is the breakfast stop for you.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	if u want awsome pancakes... then come here.. but,get ready to wait for a table,and wait outside in the heat for 40mins!!! but,worth all the wait!!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place is your typical American diner. Great hash browns, their jalepeno scramble is super good. Fresh squeezed OJ and their bread with their home made fresh blueberry jam was delicious! I will bring my boyfriend here before I leave AZ.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I haven't been here in a while.  Stopped in Monday AM and didn't have to wait for a table which is rare.  I had their special which was scrambled eggs with apple sausage and spinach.  Served with hash browns and toast it was a great way to start the day.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This is a small place with a big name. Luckly we went after the lunch rush about 1:15 and had to wait only 15 min. This is a small place and we had 4 people, so they had to put two tables together for us. We ordered the griddle cakes, the hog and chick, salami scramble and the chop and chick. The wait time on the food was average and it came out hot and straight from the kitchen (which was not far away). The griddle cakes were very good, light and fluffy. The warm maple syrup and real butter were good touches. The salami scramble and the hog and chick were good , but nothing special. The chop and chick was highly recommended to me so I was excited to try it. The flavor was good , but they over cooked it a bit. It was on the dry side and did not wow me. I did like the hash browns. As a rule I have not found any place that does good hash browns.This place does. Crunchy on the outside without being dry on the inside. The service was good and the overall experience fine.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's Big Breakfast!  Best breakfast downtown!  Guy Fieri's been here!!!!!\n\nHold on a minute.... once you get over the hype, unfortunately, you find that Matt's is just average.  We went recently and contended with the customary long wait for our table.  Once seated in the cramped, homey space, we were ready to be dazzled.  Problem is, my griddlecakes were just average.  In fact, the pancakes I make at home (America's Test Kitchen recipe) are probably better.  My daughter's waffle was fine, but again, nothing extraordinary.  Our waitress seemed to always be forgetting something - water, oj, side dish, etc.  For the hassle, Matt's is not worth it.  I'd rather have breakfast at Province in the new Westin down the street.\n\nOnce you get over the hype, you'll get over Matt's.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Honestly, I wait in line for the bacon. \nMatt's bacon is not for everyone, that's for sure. Vegetarians, look away! 'cause this stuff is fatty, medium-rare, meat candy! The pepper sounded off-putting to me until I tasted it, and oh, how I enjoy it.\nBeen there many times and whenever my Foodie brother is in town, he takes me there so he can get 2 or 3 orders of bacon.\nGreat on the side of their Griddlecakes, which taste like a combination of a corn muffin and a pancake. De-lish.\nWorth the wait.\nOh, and remember: this is a Divey Diner in an undesirable section of Downtown Phoenix--so SNOBS BEWARE!\nThe rest of us will continue to enjoy the homemade goodness.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	So I have this thing about long waits at breakfast places.  Every town in America seems to have at least one annoyingly popular place with a line  around the corner and overrated pancakes, omelets, etc.  Having visited Matt's on two previous occasions I found it to be great, but because it violated my "line theory" I've resisted embracing it.  Until now.  After meeting a friend at Matt's for breakfast this morning (and waiting about 30 minutes) I can honestly say that this place is the real deal.  The food isn't gourmet or even creative, it isn't supposed to be.  Rather it's classic breakfast done to perfection.  Exceptional pork, eggs, potatoes, breads, everything.  Although it pains me to say it, this is a breakfast place worth waiting in line for.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place was on the DD&D places my family wanted to go while in town, I joined them since I'd heard plenty about it but never gone.\n\nThe place is small, so yes there is going to be a wait.  You chose to eat there knowing this so complaining about the wait is pretty ridiculous.  That said, I'm not sure if I'd attempt coming here on a weekend, but during the workweek it was fine, the wait was maybe 20-30 minutes.\n\nThe food was great, the coffee was strong.  My only complaint is with more than one person checking on our table we asked for water from them 2-3 times and I don't think they ever came back with it.  Wasn't that big of a deal but seemed like it wasn't that hard since they were checking on us about every 2 minutes (got the feeling of being rushed through our meal, but maybe that is their way of keeping the flow of folks coming in and out).
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I have seen the lines here on the weekends and avoid the place but I drive by during the week sometimes and notice nobody standing around so I sneak in for some food.  The specials I have tried were all very good. I love the buttery hash browns. Mmmm.. Tried a waffle and it was great also. This is one of the best breakfast resturants I have tried.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This is not a place for the calorie conscious, so dieters need to swear off this place like the plague. Even the salads here are smothered in bacon, eggs, cheese and dressing. But if you feel like punishing your arteries in the most delicious fashion, I highly recommend Matt's Big Breakfast. I've heard from just about everyone I know that this place is the bee's knees, the elephant's eyebrows, the eel's hips...and the buzz wasn't wrong. \n\nThis place has some amazing hangover food, so after a night of indulging we arrived at this little diner around noon thirty and had to wait about twenty minutes to be seated. The temperature was well over 100 degrees by that point, which is not good on the dehydrated and hung over, but they were kind enough to provide a giant tub of ice water so that waiting diners didn't drop like flies before they could be served. Two stacks of complimentary foodie magazines were also present for perusal, but my brain didn't feel like thinking yet. However, by the time we were done with our dining experience at one twenty, there were empty booths all over the place, so if you're impatient, go during the last hour they're open.\n\nOnce inside, we sat at the bar, right in the path of the air conditioning vent, with a clear view of the kitchen going ons. Seeing how I drank my share of water outside I ordered an RC Cola (I didn't even know that brand still existed!) that came in a can. While waiting to order, I did some pretty extreme rubbernecking, judging the deliciousness of every dish that came out of the kitchen or was being munched on by others. The menu was modest in size but boasted that they used the freshest organic ingredients whenever possible, and after watching everyone else I was pretty excited when the time came to order. \n\nI decided to go with my traditional breakfast fare, so I could accurately compare it to other brunch joints: eggs over medium, bacon, hashbrowns and sour dough toast. The Hog and Chick!\n\nAnd. It. Was. Heaven.\n\nIt's clear that everything they offered was as fresh as it could possibly be. The toast tasted freshly baked, doughy yet crisp, and was delicious dipped in my eggs. Thick cut peppered bacon melted in my mouth. The hashbrowns had to have been made on the premises, because they looked exactly like the ones I make in my own home, greyer than the freezer variety and a bit gelatinous. There was even a tiny tub of fresh apricot puree that tasted like there wasn't a lick of processed sugar added. \n\nAnd everything was drowned to a lovely crisp in butter.\n\nI only wish it were in Tempe instead of Phoenix, because I'd love to try the other menu offerings. It's cheap, delicious, friendly, and some of the best damn hang over food I have ever had.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Food is delicious! I have been several times and you should expect a wait. They have several 2 person tables so if you have 4 or more people that wait just got worse. There food is natural and its so good...Its not too expensive either. The place is very small and parking is a problem.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Love, love, love this place.\n\nGot there at 7:15 on a Sunday, waited only five minutes and got right in. Today they had a great steak & eggs special, it was out of this world. I brought a friend who had never been there, and she loved her food as well. One thing I recommend is to order a pancake on the side (in case no one in your party orders a full order). The pancakes are unreal, they are SO good, and if you've never tried them, do yourselves a favor, and try them.\n\nAs usual, service was on point, and even though the place is packed and super busy, everything was taken care of. When I read negative reviews of the place, all I ever see is complaints because there is a wait, etc.\n\nIt is important to note, this is NOT an IHOP, or Goodegg. You WILL wait to get in, and it is worth every minute of the wait. If you're not able to do that, then perhaps you should go elsewhere. Also, if you have more than a party of four, please consider either breaking into smaller groups, or go somewhere else. \n\nThe food at Matt's Big Breakfast is thoughtfully planned, prepared, and executed. If you haven't been yet, enjoy it!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I wouldnt recommend this place for vegetarians, as they have zilch, excpet for pancakes, toast, omlette and stuff, for which I can go to ihop next door to me. The omelettes for vegetarians doesnt make the cut for me as on top of not having too many options for vegetarians, they charge much for every single topping on it. \nThe place isnt as big as the name suggests ;) but I love places like that which remind of an old house converted into an eatery. dont get me wrong, but the place is too small, but is super popular in circles, so expect a long wait time, we waited for 30 mins for 2 PM on a Tuesday. \nBut the price suits well for the Big in the name, the servings arent as big though as the name suggests. I like the build of the place, but I am not going here again.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ok, so first for the bad: \nSo the first time I went there was when some friends invited me.\nThey were already at the restaurant, I was still in bed at home in Avondale. I showered, dressed and drove over there...they were still waiting for a table. In fact once I got there we waited another 30 minutes for a table. that means my friends were waiting over an hour and a half for a table.\nMy other complaint is that my potatoes are always too burnt, even when I tell them not to burn them.\nThey are closed on Monday (you would have thought I would remember this the first two Monday;s I came to eat here)\nSo now for the good:\nEverything else! I love the food!\nThe Chop & Chick and griddle cakes are my fave for breakfast and for lunch I love...well just about everything!\nCan't wait till I move back so I can go again!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My wife and I were in the neighborhood as we had taken our daughter to check out PHX zoo. We heard about this place from diners, drive in and dives and had to check it out. \nwe were starving and had a wait for a full two hours prior to being seated! :( This place is a hole in the wall!! However, the breakfast was worth the wait! My wife had the bacon and waffle and enjoyed it so much that she ordered another order of the waffle. I had the special which was to die for, scrambled eggs with turkey sausage, peppers and cheese. \nwill definitely come back if we are nearby!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	YUMMY breakfast spot! Matt and his wife are super nice and the food is excellent. Tried the porkchop breakfast and it was soo good. Even Guy Fierri from foodnetwork thinks its the best breakfast he's ever had! \n\nThe restaurant is really tiny but didn't wanna take away a star for that cuz its definitely worth the wait. The homefries are reallly good too and you get that on the side with almost every dish anyway. =)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Being a huge fan of breakfast (who isn't?) I got really excited when I found this place using my handy dandy Yelp app on my iPhone. You see, me and 3 of my friends were in Phoenix to see the Dodgers play the Diamondbacks in a big league game at Chase Field. The bad news is the dodgers lost, but the good news is we had breakfast the next day at Matts. \n\nReading the reviews on Yelp got me way excited to eat there. People were raving about this place as if it was a small piece of heaven on earth. \n\nWe walked there from our hotel and Were quickly seated. Our first thought was, 'tiny'. But we liked that about the place. Very cozy and welcoming. Old school almost. \n\nI ordered the pancakes with a side of egg and bacon. I always have to try the pancakes first whenever I go to a new breakfast joint. It's my measuring stick. If the pancakes suck, most likely everything else will also. \n\nAfter waiting about 10 minutes the kind and very friendly waitress began to bring our food out. One at a time. Over a few minutes. She explained to us that they only had one grill so they would bring out the food as soon as it was done cooking. Again, 'tiny'. \n\nLet me tell you the wait was worth it. The pancakes were amazing. Soft, fluffy, stick to the roof of your mouth goodness. The best pancakes I have ever had. Not to mention the maple syrup was amazing. Top notch bacon and the eggs cooked like my mom made them. I was in breakfast nirvana. My only regret was leaving bits of pancake on my plate. After eating different, but equally amazing, items from my friends plate I was full. I felt like I had let my pancakes down. \n\nAs we left the restaurant we did the touristy thing to do and took a picture next to Guy Fieri's image on the wall. And had no shame about it. \n\nIf your in Phoenix you have to go to Matts Big Breakfast. There's nothing really 'tiny' about the flavor of the food there. \n\nOh and the people who were raving about Matts as of it were a small piece of heaven are all wrong. It's more like a bog chunk of heaven if you ask me.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	*burp*\nYou know you have to put the guilt aside when it's lunch with your girlfriends.  More so when Dottsy suggested Matt's.  \nIt was my first time, I remember it like it was yesterday.  Or, a half hour ago.\nSign-in at the door to wait to be seated.  Gorgeous day out, so no big deal.  I took a seat on the bench outside and waited for Dottsy.  Then a lady sat at the other end of the bench and my side flipped up.  \nI had heard it was small...but not *this* small!  It was really cute and the staff was super-friendly.  I had to pee, though.  Apparently, the bathroom was off the kitchen.  OK.  I hope to myself as I make my way past the grills that I am not posing a health hazard to Matt's.  I mean, I was wearing a baseball cap, but no net!  Bathroom was tiny with no mirror.  That was ok for me, because, as I stated, it was baseball cap day.  The bathroom and its location are the only reason I took a star off.\nI got the cheddar and mushroom omelet.  Came with a side of hash browns and toast.  With a little cup of jelly.  At first, I didn't know it was jelly...until Dottsy saw a man put his little cup-o-stuff on his toast. \nOmelet was huge, as was the hash brown.  The omelet was stuffed.  STUFFED with cheese and mushrooms.  I could see the butter on the plate.  Oh, man, this was gonna ROCK!  The hash brown was made from spaghetti-cut potatoes. Mmmmmmmmmmmyummy!\nI ate it all.  Everything.  I mean, I waited a half hour to be seated.  And my 20-year High School reunion isn't until July.  So, that's ok that I cleaned off my plate.  Right?  RIGHT????\nOh, and I ran into Dallas there.  Always a plus!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Love this spot - it's pretty close to the convention center so Natalie and I went here to check it out. The bacon is awesome here!\n\nTheir philosophy is great too - local, organic, etc. etc.  The place is tiny and quaint too and as always it's great to support a local independent business.  \n\nBest breakfast in Phoenix that i've had and definitely one of my fave spots - went there the next day too - got the special and it was delish - check my photos to see what we got!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This was a YELP guided breakfast stop on our Spring Training week food tour. I trust YELPers to guide me to the best places and they always come through. They were right on about the wait. Mid week around 9am and there was about a 30 minute wait with lots of people waiting outside the tiny little restaurant. Luckily we were just a 2 waiting for a seat, as opposed to the party of 9 who would have to be broken up or wait for hours to be seated.... (HINT HINT, not a place for groups. 2 is ideal. 3-4 is max unless you do not care about sitting together.)\n\nHaving been on day four of greasy high caloric breakfasts, I opted for the steel cut oatmeal with the raisins and brown sugar and an OJ. SG got standard egg plate with eggs, toast, ham and rosemary potatoes. SG was very happy when his plate arrived. The large piece of ham and the delicious rosemary potatoes set this place aside in his mind. My oatmeal was very good, but my humungous raisins put it over the top. The service was great and Matt himself was even there helping out. \n\nSG said this is how a breakfast place should be done and this is the model he would use for his own breakfast place (that will most likely never happen). The menu is limited, but offers the usuals. There is special attention paid to those things like the potatoes and the raisins that makes this place special. \n\nCheck it out. Expect a wait, bring a news paper.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	meh. i've experienced better.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Friendly service, great atmosphere, excellent coffee (they have their own house blend of a local coffeemaker) and phenomenal food!!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Drive all the way from Buckeye to Matt's at least once every other week. It's so worth the drive...and the wait Beware...you will have at least a 15 min. wait. But it is soooo worth it! Best Waffles I have EVER had. Bacon is as it should be, thick, crispy and MEATY! I haven't even started on the homefries...YUM! They use all fresh ingredients bought locally, even the coffe is bought from a local place, Cave Creek Coffee. They have me hooked...\n\nDo yourself a favor, come down here, order ANYTHING and enjoy! You will NOT be disappointed.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Go to Matt's...wait in line if you have to...fight for parking...just go.  I don't like going too early, as the American fried potatoes haven't had the opportunity to soak in enough rosemary and get that nice crisp crust from the grill yet.\n\nHands down, the best breakfast I've had in the Valley.  Bacon arrives fresh each day...I think everything does.  Coffee is terrific and then there's this woman...(Matt's wife), who just simply lights up the place.  \n\nI go to restaurants a lot...more than most...more than I probably should.  I will go once on a recommendation from someone.  I will go back again, if the place measures up.  If I go back more frequently, it's because of the people.  And Matt's is about the people.\n\nI've met great people there and although I maybe get there 5-6 times a year, they remember me.  That's cool...and very important.\n\nSimply put, I have not found a meal there I haven't liked, but most often, the Special of the Day is just out of the world delicious.  Also, just trust me here...get the American fried potatoes...again...trust me.  Delicious.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Hands down, best pancakes I have ever had. I would wait three hours for those babies! Went on a Sunday, waited almost 2 hours and boy was it worth it. I would suggest going on a weekday early morning to avoid the wait but I promise you will be glad you waited! You can also do take out. Oh, and get the orange juice!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	A great local place for a filling breakfast!  Just get ready to wait for a table...the space is small but they do a good job of getting people in and out quickly!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	More like matt's small breakfast!\n\nThe big name and high prices were certainly not reflected in the portion sizes. That being said, the portions were more than enough for me and I left with a full tummy. Some of the ingredients were organic and local (yay!!), but the actual food was nothing special. In fact, the raspberry preserves were the most impressive thing I ate at matt's. I feel like I could have cooked everything there (and probably more to my liking) with the ingredients in my refrigerator and saved a chunk of change.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Came here on a Thursday morning with the boyfriend to eat and was greeted by a girl who looked like she just got to work after a night out At the club. I couldn't decide what to eat from their huge menu of 7items. The night club waitress informed us that the eggs benidict was the special today. So we ordered one each. Low and behold the plate was 11dollars each. I wouldn't have minded paying that if the food was good but it wasn't. Small portions and incredibly salty. Just terrible! I couldn't even eat my food. I wouldn't even go back if someone paid me. Maybe the people there should pay more attention to the food instead of trying so had to be hipsters.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Seriously, what the fuck are you people waiting in those long ass lines for?  Did I miss something?  Are they giving handies in the restroom... wait... do they even have a restroom?\n\nIt's so small, it's impossible to not have people in your personal bubble and who wants strangers breathing on them when they're trying to eat?  The servers are these bitchy girls that argue with each other and one looked so dirty I wanted to squirt her with my hand sanitizer each time she passed by me.  \n\nThe food - it's a normal breakfast.  Nothing about the meal made me think I was having something special.  Yes, the bacon was good but really, have you ever had bad bacon?  They don't have fountain drinks, just canned RC so I stuck to coffee.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Come here for lunch (but not too late because they close at 2pm). Then, get the Butter Burger. Even the memory of this burger makes me giddy with excitement. It's freakin' huge too. A hand formed patty, and fresh & fluffy bun. Wow, this burger will knock your socks off. Amazing quality and flavor. One of the best burgers in the entire Valley.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This was our first visit to this restaurant. First, let me say that this restaurant has awesome fresh squeezed orange juice, excellent coffee, and great service. The food was generally good. Ham was tough in spots, and my meal was definitely in need of salt and pepper.The port in my breakfast special had no taste at all. Hashbrowns were somewhat burnt. I could live with this though. However, I had to mark this restaurant down due to the lack of comfort of the "urban" stainless steel stools that are provided to customers at the counters. Here I think style was a major concern over comfort, and I urge the owners in this eatery to sit on their own stools for an hour to experience the whole dining experience. While eating there, I spent most of the time trying not to slide off of these quite small, hard and slippery shiny stainless steel wonders, and since no rail to rest your feet on is provided, staying on them depends on you using the small rails along the bottom of the stool to try and stay on them. By the end of the meal, we couldn't wait to get out of there, just so we could stand up and stretch out our backs from the lack of support, hardness, and strain of trying to stay on these little torture devices. If the idea is to make it uncomfortable enough to keep the turnover quick at the counters, then they are perfectly suited for the task. However, we will strongly reconsider whether to return, and if we do, will never sit at the counter again. Good food is available all over the valley, and being comfortable while eating is also available all over the valley. \n\nAs a suggestion to attract and keep customers, I want to make a couple of suggestions:\n\nFix the stool situation. They are a big drawback.\n\nDuring the breakfast wait, instead of that watery whatever it is that you offer to all the people waiting outside (water? lemonade?), serve coffee. When the guy brought that out, many of us said "Coffee, awesome!", and then realized it was something far less appealing. By bringing out coffee and mugs (OK to use a variety from Goodwill or whatever), you will have an automatic coffee sale and people will enjoy hanging out while waiting. You can stage it from inside to control losses and offer it to those on the waiting list if you want, but it would endear a customer such as myself to the restaurant. \n\nWhen you put down the check, explain how it works. "We can take care of this for you or you can pay at the counter" would be helpful. We weren't sure what to do and had to ask.\n\nAs it is, we may or may not return to this restaurant. Might give it one more try.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This review is NOT for the food, it is for the wait.  Seriously.... 2 hours PLUS.  \nWe sat in the hot Arizona sun with my hungry child in a questionable part of town and the only thing I received was a sun burn and major irritation from the wait.\nAfter waiting 2 hours, that was it for us.  \n*************************My philosophy is anything tastes pretty damn amazing when you are famished and dehydrated. ********************
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ive been going to Matt's for a couple years now and I have always loved the place. I go for the food because it's the best breakfast in phoenix, but even more for the awesome staff. The owner, who everyone calls Mama- which I think is so adorable- is one of the most welcoming and hospitable people i have ever seen in the restaurant business. Everyone seems like they love working there and they have so much fun together. \nI went this past sunday (11/18) and had a great experience with my husband. He had the steak and it was AMAZING and I had their scramble special which is always a winner. homefries with onions and fresh rosemary are so stinking good. My waitress was a super sweet red head and was so attentive. She checked on us just the right amount of times and went above and beyond to make our experience pleasant. I dont know what these people are complaining about, I've always had great service when we go on the weekends- maybe we will check it out on a weekday and see if its different. \nI was so impressed by all their local use of product and I think its awesome that they get the best ingredients they can. I didn't know how many local business they work with until I asked our waitress and she told us all the different places we were asking about. \n\nWill continue to go to Matts every weekend. Keep up the great work everyone!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	So this place may be a bit overrated. I arrived around 9 on a Tuesday morning, and I only waited about 5 minutes. I was happy not to wait long, but shocked at the ridiculously small space. Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives really makes it look much bigger.\n\nI don't know if it's my roots in southern breakfast or the mediocre flavoring that caused me to leave this place without much of a lasting impression. The staff was extremely nice, and I loved the fresh squeezed orange juice. Just not worth me getting up extra to include the place in my stops before work in Tempe, AZ.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Visiting Phoenix and I wanted to revisit Matt's.  I was here two years ago and I had heard that they moved, 4 months ago, to a new larger space.   \n\nThe new space is nice, but I somehow miss the tiny old one.  The little place was unique and atmospheric where the new place is cool, but somehow generic-cool.  \n\nStaff was nice enough, but it put me off a bit when they wanted $1.50 for more maple syrup.   I said OK because the pancakes were SUPER DRY.   Not good at all.   And the maple syrup is totally sub par.  Tastes like Aunt Jemima.  It's stored in big plastic jugs in the dining room.   \n\nFriend's omelette was overcooked and greasy.   Potatoes were just average.   Thick cut marble rye toast was good, but then he loves anything rye.\n\nCome on Matt, you can do better.   Spend more time training your kitchen staff.  And does your wife always wear UGGs, no matter the weather?
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The Hash browns are an amazing butter-delivery system. The bacon was thick and wonderful, and everything was spot-on delicious. It was worth the 40 minute wait, but I wish they would have more outdoor seating for when you're waiting.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	1. Awesome location.\n2. Fantastic Food.\n3. Great environment.\n\nOnly reason to not give it 5 stars is because the wait time is so long but this place is a must go.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	YUMMMMY!  What more can I say, great service and exceptional food!  Everything is fresh and cooked to perfection.  We only waited a little while to be seated, but good things are worth the wait.  We will be back for sure.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Breakfast math.  quality real ingredients + cooked  well = Great food\n\nMy wife and I stopped by to find that we were too late, the place closed 20 mins earlier.  Nuts!  \nAs we were walking away discussing how we were going to come back another day, the door behind us opened and we were invited in!!! yahoo!!! What a treat.  That never happens!!!  Thanks Matt's you rock!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We ate here last weekend and it was nice.  The wait was long but if you've never eaten there it's worth waiting for.  Once you get in there you'll see it's a fun place to be; a combination of hip/50's dinner with real all American food (especially breakfast).  I had the salami and eggs breakfast which was ok.  I thought the salami was way too salty.  The hash browns on the other hand are amazing.  They were made from real potatoes, cooked just right with plenty of grease and I loved every bite!  I also had a cup of coffee that was average at best.  My wife, on the other hand, had a glass of lemonade that was made from scratch and was sweetened with honey which we both thought was awesome.  If you're going to come here bring a small snack you can munch on outside because the wait could be up to an hour and a half.  Best thing is to call before you come and ask how long the wait is.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Wow, this is absolutely the most average place i've ever eaten breakfast.  Not much different than national chains.  Way overrated.  Do not go out of your way to eat here, you'll do just as well at a large chain.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	For so long I have been encouraged to explore the breakfast happenings at this local spot in Phoenix.  I believe I am going to be one of the few who was not wowed by what Matt had to offer.\n\nMatt's gets a big gold star for its earth friendly and locavore kitchen.  The menu features "cage free eggs from humanely raised chickens", grain fed pork and natural beef, as well as local organic produce.\n\nYou will only find a breakfast and lunch menu here, and the items are unpretentious and down-home - virtually anything I could easily whip up in my own kitchen such as BLT's, tuna salad sandwhich, tossed cobb, and burgers.\n\nAs the name infers, breakfast is big here.  And greasy and indulgent.  The "five spot" breakfast sandwhich appears to be the most popular item here and comes on a roll with two eggs, two slices of bacon, American cheese, and grilled onions.  (Personally, I feel American is the worst cheese in America, and I wish that government regulators would ban it from kitchen tables.) And when you add greasy grilled onions to an already greasy sandwhich with very un-American cheese, you get some bad bed-fellows.  So, unfortuantely, this breakfast for me was under-appreciated and finished by my breakfast date who had the same thing.\n\nOther breakfast items included omelets, salami scrambles, griddlecakes, and waffles.  Notable drink items were fresh squeezed orange juice, honey lemonade, or organic chocolate milk.\n\nVene Vidi Vici.  But I likely won't return.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Well going against the grain for sure but, this is one really over-rated joint. Not even worth the wait. I came here like at least 8 others that were waiting out front because we saw Matt's on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on TV so it was one of those "Hey that my town, We gotta go!"\nI ordered one of the plates I saw on the show, the Chop and Chick, a large succulent boneless pork chop, 3 perfectly cooked eggs, nice crispy brown hash browns, thick hand sliced toast, \nWhats not to like right,?\nWell waiting on the sidewalk out front at Matt's for 1.5hrs to finally get into Breakfast Nirvana, order up and here you go \n1 thin 25% bone pork chop over cooked and dry. Ever compare a Big Mac in an ad to the one you get in a box and you'll see my point here.\n3 eggs still slimy and runny, medium eggs means medium\n1 huge helping of hash browns that I could have cooked the next 6 orders of eggs with the grease they wallowed in.\nSourdough Toast, 4 stars perfect, excellent.\nSo not all bad, just way over rated, and the following day a really great breakfast at a real local spot Big Daddy's up on Cave Creek Rd and Peoria, excellent in every way and we had never been there for breakfast before but we will be back, Matt's not a chance.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I was specifically looking for a good breakfast place in Phoenix. The concierge suggested Matt's Big Breakfast. I looked at some yelp reviews and figured I'd give it a try. I took the light rail over from my hotel and got off too soon and ended up doing a bit of walking in 100 degree weather. The place was small, had air conditioning, and I was hoping I wouldn't have to wait, even though the reviews said otherwise. I was by myself and able to sit at the counter right away! I ordered the belgian waffle, which had sweet cream butter, sprinkled with powdered sugar and maple syrup on the side. It was served with a side of thick cut bacon, which I have never tasted like this before - it was peppered and tasted really good! I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs. Let me tell you, the food was good - I ate my entire breakfast! The staff was very friendly too. As I was paying and getting ready to leave, I noticed a stamp of Guy Fieri's face on the wall! This place had been featured on the Food Network and I had no idea - usually I look up where he goes or places featured on Man vs. Food. I'd say stop in and check it out if you're in the area!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Loved everything about this place, decor, service, food, all get 5 stars. Simple, high quality ingredients cooked perfectly always make for a great experience in my book. Had the Nieman ranch beef burger and it was out of control. Gotta go back to try the namesake Breakfast!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	After hearing rave reviews, we finally went to try for first time.  Between the long wait time just to be seated, poor service, the constant waiting and having to ask for refills.  We even went to the front and asked for our check rather than continuing to wait for it.  The food was good no doubt about it, but with as much hypster hype as there has been about Matt's Big Breakfast, we expected better.  Probably wont be back....
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	You seriously cannot go wrong if you've wound up at this place.  Everything on the menu is simply fantastic.  When I finally ventured to have lunch here I got blown away by the grilled chicken sandwich.  Its really small though so you usually have to wait.  And its so small you usually have to wait outside.  Because its so small.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I don't get the rave reviews or how anybody can claim that this is the "be all, end all" for breakfast.  \n\nPros-\nA friendly server\nDecent bacon, though heavy on the pepper\n\nCons-\nOverpriced for what you get-$7.50 for pancakes a la carte and my personal favorite $1.25 extra charge for more syrup!  With a side of bacon and a coffee that meal alone was $12 before tax & gratuity.\n1 slice of toast with a 2 egg breakfast...who does that?\n6oz Orange Juice....$2.50!\nThree in your party, oh I'm sorry you will have to squeeze into the corner with an extra chair because we won't seat you at a table for four is how the visit started!\n\nI understand why everyone claims that it is always so busy, there might be 20 seats in the entire place!  Not going to be back any time soon with all of the other options downtown for breakfast these days.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place has great food, great service, great atmosphere...but a crappy wait. \n\nI love eating at Matt's, but I don't go as frequently as I would like because of the wait. I think the food is better than most, they use fresh ingredients from the farmers market down the way, which always improves food quality.\n\nSome people don't like the size of the restaurant, but I love it! It wouldn't be as fun and intimate if it were bigger. I have had Matt's a few times, but today I went at 6:40 (10 minutes after they open) and it was incredible. There was no line and no people, making the feel of a "small breakfast joint" feel real. It was calm, quiet, wonderful and reminded me to write a review! So, if you're an early bird and can get there around opening time, I highly recommend it! Otherwise, it's good, but prepared to wait while sipping on some yummy grapefruit water.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Awesome toast. Awesome waffles. Awesome coffee. The bacon wasn't crispy, but everything else was so awesome it didn't matter. New, bigger location. Highly recommend!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	So I'm heading out to California and I decide to "load up" before I hit the road. I've been wanting to try Matt's ever since I moved here last year. So, I get up early to try to get a head start on traffic and lo and behold, traffic. I finally get there after a few wrong turns (Thanks stupid GPS, you're going back from whence you came). I sidle up to the bar and now the decicsion begins. Eggs? Omelette? Cakes? Cakes it is and a side of bacon. While I wait with my cup of coffee, which wasn't half bad, I take in the smallness of this place. Glad I got there early. The GriddleCakes arrive with the bacon. The sweet cream they use makes other places cakes seem like toast. Rich and fluffy with the melting butter on top and real maple syrup, Wooo! The bacon was nice. Cooked to where it wasn't too crispy or too rubbery. And with pepper. Now I just hope I don't fall asleep during my drive. Oh, and what's with the metered parking. I put my .60 in the meter which should have given me an hour and I go out to my car 45 minute later and the meter says expired. What?
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	YUMMMMMM!!  Had the days special scramble: sausage w peppers w hashbrowns; just perfect w a crispy crust & perfect inside not mushy. BF had Chick n Chop. I'm not a fan of pork chops but thaws were flavorful, tender and just super yum!  My only gripe is that I ordered fresh, i got a bout 6oz,  for $2.75 yikes!!!\nCaution it can get crowded and its a pretty small location. But I think it was good, luckily we only waited 15 min but locals say sometimes it can be pretty long
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I like Matt's.  I understand some of the criticisms but I also understand the raves.\n\nPros: \n-The food IS good. Some of the items are breakfast basics, sure, but the pancakes are anything but ordinary.  They're almost perfect.   The home fries are great - rosemary goodness. There's also a great menu selection - a nice mix of breakfast standards with unique and special twists.\n-The atmosphere.  Yeah it's small, but it's part of the charm.\n\nCon:\n-It's expensive.  There's no way around it.\n- It IS small.  You will have to wait, sometimes for a long time.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	As the 5 stars show "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" Ok, it is only breakfast but  great, consistent fair. Tiny little place so you will have to wait but they keep the folks rolling in and out. Been there twice and have sat at the counter both times. The Hog & Chick with bacon, thick bacon...awesome!  Eggs the way you want. Get the hash browns as they are better than you can make at home, but if you like your potatoes chunky then get the home fries but a warning for people who aren't into rosemary, home fries have rosemary on them. Fresh sliced toast and homemade jam, I think it was plum. My wife had the omelet and loved it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	So I'm watching Diners, Drive-in's and Dive's on the Food Network and they do a feature on this place.  Go on and on about the waffles.  So the next morning, we head over.  Walk up to the building and people everywhere just standing around.  So I walk in side and was stopped by a server and told to step outside.  She handed me a clipboard and walked back in.  Apparently, I was suppose to put my own name down on the list to be seated, so I did.  We waited almost and hour.  We were finally called to head in.  Walk in and can't believe how tiny this place is...they sit the three of us down at a table made for one so we're all fighting over elbow space.  Look over the menu and decide to order a waffle, eggs and OJ.  Server tells me the waffle iron is broken.  That was the only reason I came here because of the so called world famous waffles.  So I settle for pancakes, eggs and OJ.  They bring out my teaspoon of OJ.  Seriously I have never had such a small glass of OJ.  The food finally arrives, and to tell you the truth, it was good but not worth the hour of my life I spent standing outside waiting.  I'll stick to IHOP.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I definitely would have to give Matts a 4 stars max, could not give it a 5 stars because I do believe they are of a five star quality but lack any originality as say a Liberty Market. \n\nHave heard a ton about Matts and I do have to say that they have quality food, Went there and had waffles with bacon and a side order of potatoes. They do make basic food very well and that is a good but it is basic food. Nothing imaginative or out of the ordinary, so nothing to really to say WOW that is something new. Again though they do basic food very well which is harder said then done, and that is why I would recommend it, I would not go out of my way though just because of the location and the size of the place, but I only judge by food. If you can get in the food is very good even great.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Yes, the menu looks small and simple, but this place is really good!  I went for breakfast. We both had eggs.  My eggs were eggs. But, the eggs with salami were really yummy and salty. The hash browns and home fires were awesome! Some of the best I'd ever had.  The toast was delicious and came with (I think homemade) blackberry preserves. So good!  And my coffee and water glass was never empty.  \n\nWe went on a weekday at 7:30 and there was no wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Went in today for lunch, and ordered the AM special. The special was originally a 3 egg scramble with provolone cheese, ham, and fresh locally grown organic spinach. I subbed out the ham for their amazing bacon, and this was definitely a treat! I got this with white toast and their delicious home fries (they're the best I have ever had). \n\nIt's too bad Matt's doesn't open more locations around the valley. I really wish they had one closer to Scottsdale/ Tempe. I would be there 4 times a week!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Breakfast was good. Staff was great. Wait was long, if your really hungry bring a snack.. we ran errands while waiting. I would go again with people who haven't been, but mostly for the novelty of experiencing breakfast that you have to wait an hour for..
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I've decided to make this one short and sweet...\n\nThe Menu - Too Small.\nThe Food - Good, but nothing special.\nThe Service - Stellar.\nThe Aesthetics - Cute, 5&Diner-ish, CRAMPED!\nThe Wait - Too long & clearly not worth it.\n\nJust because Guy Fieri ate here...Puh-leeze. 2 Stars because I genuinely appreciate a warm and attentive wait staff.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I really enjoyed this place when I went a few weeks ago.  I hear that there is usually a long wait to get in, when I went I was lucky enough to only wait about 5 minutes before there was a table ready for us, but then again I went at 11 am on a Tuesday so I think that helped a bit.  \n\nI went on the advice of a family member.  What I wish had been mentioned was the process of how you put your name in for a table.  There is a notebook outside the front door where you write your name and the number of people in your party on.  \n\nThe coffee i had was AMAZING, and it set high expectations for the meal which were definitely met.  I had a special for that day (egg scramble with artichoke chicken sausage and gruyere cheese I believe) with sourdough toast and a side of the homefries.  I would eat this meal again in a heartbeat.  Everything was incredibly fresh down to the homemade strawberry jam.  \n\nThis is a place I definitely want to go back to.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Perfect if you are craving a home-style breakfast.  I had a wonderful mushroom scramble, sausage, and the walnut raisin toast.  The portions were big and the food was very good - quality ingredients.  My only gripe is the orange juice.  It was $2.50 for a shot glass size cup of orange juice and it was half pulp.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I've lived downtown for 5 years now and never heard of this place until I saw it on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives'...\n\nJust kidding. I'm a semi-regular. I say "semi" because I go in series. I'll go four or five times in a two week period and then have to lay off and hit the gym to work off the 20 pounds I gained. But I keep going back.\n\nMatt uses a lot of butter when he cooks, which makes everything taste better. The fresh made pancakes and waffles are awesome with real maple syrup. The pork chop and eggs is a delightfully dangerous breakfast, marinated in a homemade pesto sauce (the porkchop, that is - who marinates eggs?). The thick cut bacon strips are great for breakfast and even better in the BLT (which I sometimes order with a fried egg on it for breakfast, a BELT).\n\nIt looks as though most people are saying this is a '$' place but I would give it '$$'. I have yet to leave there with a bill under $10.\n\nSome complain about the wait but I have and answer for that - don't go if you're in a hurry. If you go on a weekend, bring an iPod or something to read while you're waiting.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	There were a couple of reviews for Matt's Big Breakfast that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  Two people made the comment that "Denny's makes a better breakfast".  That is patently ridiculous.  The only time someone cracks open an egg at Denny's is if you order them sunny side up.  Otherwise, they pour pre-scrambled eggs (as does IHOP) from a bottle.  The other comments I've read are "there's nothing here that can't be made at home."  Completely true, but that could be said of a lot of restaurants.  The whole point is going OUT to eat when you don't want to make food at home.  Frankly, some of the lesser starred reviews would be much different if not for the long waits.  Anyway, I digress...\n\nLike many, I first became aware of MBB after it was featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (DDD, Triple D, 3D, etc.)  It looked good, but nothing terribly special.  Certainly not like some of the places I've seen on DDD, which leave me checking travel websites for flights.  But, I thought, "If I'm in Phoenix, I'll give this a try."  \n\nSo, I'm in Phoenix and craving breakfast.  I make my way down to Matt's and while there are 6-7 people milling about outside, it's not too bad.  After waiting maybe 30 minutes (downright speedy compared to the wait endured by some other reviewers), my name is called and I enter the tiny eatery.  The menu is pretty sparse, but there are some specials so I opted for one of the items on the chalkboard: egg, spinach, mushroom, smoked gouda scramble with hash browns and toast.  While I wait for my meal, I enjoy some of the very tasty coffee.  My plate arrives, and it is a large serving of food, contradicting the reports of skimpy servings.  As a lover of hash browns, I had to try them first.  Crispy and super buttery, just as I recalled when watching DDD.  The scramble was excellent and you could tell how fresh the ingredients are.  I decided to save my toast and housemade jam as my "dessert", so to speak.  I think my only issue was with the hash browns.  They started off so well, but it was a large portion and at the halfway point the richness of the butter started taking its toll.  I soldiered on and finished my plate, but I seriously thought I'd have a heart attack.  Sadly, did not have room for my toast and jam.\n\nIf I ever find myself in Phoenix again, I would come back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Probably the best breakfast I've had. Long wait, over an hour on a sunday but all was amazing. Saw it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and it still impressed.\n\nGot the prime flank steak with over easy eggs, sourdough, hashbrowns, and coffee.\n\nFlank steak was fat, juicy, and had a great pink to it. Kind of tough crust but definately impressive for a breakfast place. Eggs were good and cooked good too. Homeade blueberry preserves were amazing and I put them on everything. Bread was nice but the best was the hashbrowns. Best hashbrowns I have had to date. Crispy outside but so soft and buttery inside. Flawless texture and flavor. You MUST try these, you won't regret it. Waiter said to try cheddar cheese on them the next time and I will definately be back and can't wait to try it. \n\nDefinately best breakfast and you have to go here if your in the area.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	"What is this? A restaurant for ants? I don't want to hear any excuses! The building has to be at least... Three times bigger than this!"\n\nOn a more serious note, this is a teeny, tiny restaurant - so small that the first action of order is to write your name on a notepad that is waiting on a small table outside the entrance. Then expect to wait outside until there is space inside, because there is simply no space to stand and wait inside. But when you do manage to stick a foot in the door, Matt's Big Breakfast invites you in to a cheery, diner-esque environment but with fresh flowers on the table and nicer than average cutlery to boot. Like the establishment, the menu is small. We ordered the Salami Scramble and the Chop & Chick.\n\nSALAMI SCRAMBLE\nThough I can always appreciate a bacon and eggs type breakfast, the peppery punch of the salami scramble was a nice change from the classic. Of course breakfast isn't breakfast without some made-from-scratch hash browns that were crispy but not too oily. I generally like my browns a little less fried, but I still enjoyed these taters nonetheless.\n\nCHOP & CHICK\nThe pork chop was expertly seasoned which was right up my alley, because huge hunks of just meat just doesn't hit the spot. Huge hunks of meat with lots o' spices though? Oh yes.\n\nAll in all, a nice experience at this charming little restaurant. I would definitely visit when I want some good ol' meat and potatoes for breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I love Matts and feel everything about this place is IMPECCABLE. But unfortunately the small capacity seating and over an hour waiting in line ALWAYS turns me away.  Id be around more often if I wasn't wasting my weekends sitting on a hot bench.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Thumbs Up!\n\nI vouch Matt's Hog & Chick is worth the long wait!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	100% bomb! Everything they make oozes amazing, homemade, quality goodness. The pancakes are heaven, the hog and chick is fab, and the rosemary breakfast potatoes are perfect. I have been a handful of times, and it's always worth the wait.\n\nNote: This place is ridiculously small (but charming), so don't go with a bunch of friends and expect to sit together...or be seated anytime soon. Carry out is a good option, but only for those who have had the sit in experience first ;)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Wow great breakfast spot. My friends recommended going after seeing it on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on the food network and we were not disappointed. Being the norcal gal I am I called and asked if the line was hella long... the gal on the phone mentioned that around 12:30-1pm the line calms down. We got there and were seated immediately. Bonus points for having ice cold water outside too. This place was perfect for recovering after the previous nights drink fest. I had the Five Spot with hash browns and it was amazing. My entire group agreed I picked the best thing off the menu. When I'm back in Phoenix I will be back for the Five Spot again..
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Every Phoenix visit, I make it a point to come to Matt's. BUT... once a year is just not enough. And though my time in Phoenix is always limited, that hour and a half wait for a table is worth the wait every single time.\n\nIf you're here for breakfast, order the special. You will never be disappointed. It's usually some sort of scramble, with fresh local ingredients. The potatoes with rosemary always hits the spot. Do yourself a favor and get the LARGE freshly squeezed orange juice. The small is a tiny little thing, and if you're gonna spend the money, spend the extra buck and get more.\n\nMy favorite lunch item is the Rueben. BEST RUEBEN EVER. And I've had my share of reubens. This sandwich is magic in your mouth. The last time I had one, I decided that I also wanted breakfast, so I had them add an over-easy egg in the sandwich. That was heaven in my mouth---- I still dream of that particular sandwich.\n\nA majority of the items on the menu are made with local ingredients (jam, bread, and coffee included). The service is ALWAYS fast and friendly. And as tiny as the place is, they turn tables quickly and keep everything immaculately clean.\n\nI love Matts. Best breakfast in the entire state of Arizona. Oh yeah. I just said that. And I meant it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What a cute place.  Believe me, the place is small but the breakfast is big.   \n\nIt is a tiny dwelling and I can't imagine the wait time during their peak business hour but talk about helping the little guy out and everyone there was pleasant and most importantly the food was great.  I want to try everything there when I return.\n\nBTW, they had the best tasting hash browns I've ever had.... Thinly sliced and well done.....Just the way I ordered it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	was in town for a convention and was so surprised how good the food in phoenix was!\n\nComing from the LA area, you become kind of a food snob, but Matt's Big Breakfast beats all.  \n\nThe BEST Belgium waffle I have ever had.\nWait was a little long on the Saturday morning for a table for 3, but it was well worth the wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	It's always a gamble when I stop in at Matt's because the line is unpredictable.  However, the fact that there IS a line should tell you that this place is pretty stellar.  Because I'm a creature of habit, I don't normally order anything besides the special or the hog and chick.  You really can't go wrong with either.  Every dish is made with high quality ingredients.  I always rave to my friends about how the spinach in the special was the most spinachy spinach I've ever tasted (that's a good thing).  Thick slices of peppery bacon = party in my mouth.  Their caramelized onions tossed with perfectly crispy on the outside but soft on the inside potatoes are also a different yet equally awesome party in my mouth.  What gets me every time is their thick slice of toast and organic preserves.  SO GOOD.  And a coffee mug that's never empty, that's always a plus too.  Matt, I don't know who you are but your breakfasts are delightful.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I came here a couple weeks ago while passing through Phoenix, and it was delicious! As mentioned before, there is a bit of a wait. However, we just walked around a little bit and explored the area, and pleasantly, there was no pressure by the servers to turn over tables once we were seated. The venue itself is small, but beautiful. The windows were large and filled with natural light making it seem open and spacious.\n\nThe food was also really good. While the salami scramble didn't particularly suit my taste, they had crispy hashbrowns and freshly made cherry jam to go with the toast-- both were above and beyond. I'll definitely be back next time in town.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The french toast is RIDICULOUSLY delicious.  I love Matt's! Definitely one of my favorite breakfast places in Phoenix.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I was disappointed too.  I waited an hour and then took at seat at the counter which is ok with me, but if you've got long legs your only option is to sit spread-eagled in order to get close enough to your plate and there's not that much legroom to each side.  In the small space in front of the counter the staff was in perpetual motion squeezing past each other to get drinks, etc.   My cheddar, jalepeno, sausage omelette was very good, but not huge, and the hash browns were crisp and tasty on the outside but soggy on the inside.  The whole wheat toast was great, but no choice of toppings...I was given a small dollop of peach preserves. \nThe waffles next to me looked fabulous, but I'm not a fan.   Basically I didn't think it wasn't worth the hour wait in 100 degrees and I was relieved to get outside where there was some breathing room.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I love Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and it's been a personal quest to try the restaurants on Guy's shows. Matt's Big breakfast was one of those places. By the sight of the long line outside the restaurant at 1230, I had big hopes for this place! We sat down and were greeted with water from a waitress who was dressed for the gym or a booty dance in her too short too tight too small shorts. \n\nThe meal-\n1) breakfast sandwich. Very tasty! The peppered bacon made the dish.\n2) famous has browns- crispy outside but the inside was a mushy mash consistency\n3) griddle cakes- fluffy and light, but nothing to write home about. \n\nService- we asked one of the waiters for an extra plate to share. He brought one with dried omelet residue on, put it on our table, saw the same leftover meal we saw, then proceeded to scrap it off with his nail, then put it back on our table. I didn't know what to do but laugh at the awkward experience, at which the same waiter rushed back and asked if that plate was okay. Oh boy...\n\nOverall good but wouldn't wait again for it
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Awesome place. Be ready to wait because it is very popular place.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's Big Breakfast is the real deal - celebrating tons of local ingredients and making everything from scratch. But the wait can be killer.\n\nWe were a party of three going to Matt's about noon on a Sunday. I had heard about the wait, but the hour we sat there was still pretty rough. Once we were seated, though, the service was fast and friendly.\n\nOur friend (who's a local) told us the best thing on the menu was The Hog & Chick, so that's what all of us ordered. I was totally pleased with everything:\n\n* Coffee - from a local roaster\n* OJ - freshly squeezed (in a teeny tiny glass)\n* Eggs - fresh and local\n* Potatoes - buttery, herbed, and delicious\n* Toast - thick, buttery, and delicious\n* Preserves - homemade at Matt's and super delish\n* ham - a giant slab of serious goodness\n\nThe price was very reasonable too - especially for the quality of food. For all the items listed above, I paid about $15. Next time I'm in the area, I'll totally go back to Matt's, but I'll try to pick an obscure time when the wait isn't quite so bad.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ordered the famous "Butter Burger" medium rare. Forget lettuce, tomato, and pickle, eat this with cheese and maybe some ketchup to let that beef shine through. Delicious! Great diner atmosphere, got to sit at the counter.\n\nHappy to see it was Niman Ranch beef, a sustainable/organic livestock provider.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Been here a couple times.  Liked it a lot, the food was good, the service is warm and friendly and the wait was fun with friends.  I don't have anything against Matt - I love the Roosevelt and visit there fairly often - I just don't see the point in waiting, in the sun, for breakfast - when it's not that special and if you have to walk into the hotel next door to use the restroom.  I am looking forward to some competition.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What do they do to make a basic breakfast so good? Well, actually mine wasn't basic. I took the special off the board: Andouille sausage, havarti cheese (I think), a lovely red spicy pepper three egg omelette AH-mazing, their famous potatoes on the side. Thick slices of whole grain bread on the side with a tiny bit of butter (I wish it had more). One of my kids had the breakfast sandwich with bacon, one had the chicken marinated in pesto sandwich, and the husband had something I can't remember but everyone was very full, very happy even after waiting well over an hour to get seated.  We did ask for a grilled cheese sandwich for our kid and the waitress looked at us stunned and said it's not on the menu. True but they have bread and cheese right? Oh well. What I loved more than anything was every staff person you come in contact with says: Thank you for waiting! \n\nI hope to go back soon even though it's a 40 minute drive from my house and more than likely an hour wait to get in - it's worth it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Maybe I'm biased because I can make a damn tasty breakfast myself at home, but for all the rave reviews and even being on TV, I expected this place to be a little above average.\n\nDecent food, awesome waitstaff.  Let's weigh the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n*good tasty bacon...\n*hashbrowns to die for - crunchy on the outside, creamy inside...\n*definite use of fresh ingredients...\n\nCons:\n*it felt like eating in my pantry with 25 other people...\n*all the cooks get to hear you peeing in the water closet (and I mean closet)...(maybe this is a problem only for the female persuasion?)...\n*almost $2 for a CAN of RC that probably cost them 25 cents, no free refills...\n*one egg was undercooked and one was overcooked...\n*feeling rushed to finish and get out of there as people outside stare at you wondering why you're taking so long to eat...\n\nOh and not to mention the butter burger that was ordered with blue maytag that I had to try a bite of - and ended up with a couple of tablespoons of hot boiling butter in my lap.  The maytag was yummy and fortunately I could taste it despite my scorched tongue.\n\nWe definitely left with full tummies (including my red burnt one) but more cons than pros means it was worth it to try for the first time, but I think the only item I might crave is the hashbrowns.  If I ever REALLY have to have their hashbrowns, I'll order it to go!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This is the type of restaurant you only go to once.\nI have now been there twice - once at the old location, once at the new one.\nThe reason you only go there once?\n\nHOLY WAIT TIME, batman.\n\nI'm sorry, but there has to be a way to make the seating more efficient.  When you're hungry, there's nothing worse than 30-60 minute wait times, or a giant party of 15 people who arrive later than you do and they get to "squeeze in". Although Matt's has just upgraded to a new, bigger space, this still isn't the type of restaurant that should be accommodating 15-person groups (AKA almost the entire dining area).\n\nWe went here for my husband's birthday on a Friday morning. After waiting about 45 minutes, we were next on the list but got bumped to the uncomfortable street-facing counter seats, when at that very moment there were three empty two-top tables, completely set with silverware and everything. We asked if we could be seated there instead, but were turned down by the host, because they were being reserved for the aforementioned party. My husband was having trouble with knee pain that morning and the counter seats did not physically accommodate his needs, so we asked our waitress if there was anywhere else we could sit. Again, we were turned down. I was getting a little flustered, not the way you want to feel on your loved one's birthday. We considered leaving, even after we ordered our food. Eventually, they did allow us to sit at a two-top, which I appreciated.\n\nThe food was the only redeeming quality, but again I was too flustered to truly enjoy it. I got the cheese omelette with hash browns. Very good, although hash browns were a greasy, mushy mess. My husband got a ham scramble of some kind. We had a side of rye toast, which was tasty. Beverages were served in cute little jam jars.\n\nPROS:\nFood, Decor, Charm, Ambience, Supporting a local endeavor\n\nCONS:\nThe most hyper-inflated wait time and some of the worst seating options of any restaurant I've ever known.\n\nThe take-out option sounds nice, and would eliminate a lot of my frustrations.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Scrambled eggs & Salami. Very good, The hash browns & jam were superb
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	To be fair, we went to Matt's based on the raveswe read on various sources.  Like the emperpr's new clothes, we fail to see what the hubbub is all about. I recently went to breakfast there and order a cheese omelet with home fries and wnet away hungry and very disappointed.  The home fries were mostly uncooked and badly seasoned,  The eggs were hard and disappointing and the toast was hard and cold.  This was very unsatisfactory and it is certain that Matt's Breakfast lives off its laurels and not the food.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Great breakfast down to the toast. Delicious fresh-squeezed OJ and the Hash browns were to die for. Ham was a bit tough to cut but good flavor. Was traveling alone for work and enjoyed sitting at one of he window seats. Imagine there'd be quite a wait if it hadn't been 645AM on a week day. Will recommend to friends passing through PHX for sure.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I waited for 2-3 hours awhile back because everyone was raving about this place.. I had the pork chop but it wasn't anything special. Maybe I was just tired from waiting so long. I didn't get what was so special about the place. But I will try it again and maybe find the magic in it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I am going to make this review short and sweet..\n\nGreat food! I love the hashbrowns! I am big fan of the food!\n\nThe negative end of this place... the wait. Its a great place to take out of town guests or an occasional place to drop into every now and then. I don't think any place is worth waiting 45 minutes in the heat.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	was in town for spring training walking around one morning looking for a bite to eat and ran into this gem because i saw a line outside and decided if people are waiting this long to get a seat it must be good as to be a reason for the wait and i was not dissapointed i had the special of the day which was eggs benedict with thick cut pieces of ham and a most excellent hollandaise and i destroyed it so much flavor my mouth was doing backflips wish i could have tried so much more on their menu but thats gives me another reason to visit beautiful phoenix again so next time u see a line outside of this place or any for that reason dont run away because there has to be a reason people are waiting to get inside and matts will not
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Guy Fieri's recommendations never disappoint. \n\nCame in with the expectation that this place would be good considering it was on the Food Network but my expectations were exceeded! Had the Salami Scramble which was DELICIOUS! The side of hashbrowns were AMAZING (maybe the best part of the meal) and I was pleasantly surprised the side of toast was a legit piece of bread, like something you would find at a bakery, and not just a slice of bread you could buy at the market. Eggs were fresh and light and the salami was perfection. \n\nOnly downside was that they made us wait outside for our table which was a little ridiculous considering it was 115 degrees outside. But I got nothing bad to say about their food.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	An absolutely wonderful breakfast.  I had the special...hot peppers with scrambled eggs.  Couldn't have been better.  Matt's Big Breakfast is a small spot, but I understand they are moving to bigger quarters.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Butter Burger. For breakfast.\n\nWhat part of that is ambiguous?\n\nNo reason to waste space saying what has already been said: best breakfast in town. Sure Matt is mean to me. And I don't go there enough. But my wife is 10 years younger than me and I have to maintain my svelte figure.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	You have to love a place that still cares enough to use half a stick of butter when they cook your meal.  Throw in some Bourbon candied sausage and you have a real old fashioned breakfast cafe.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	best breakfeast downtown ... bar none ... it's far more "healthy" than I traditionally prefer but the place is beatiful, very cool and has an ADORABLE waitress ;) !!!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Please, people! For the love of God, stay home! Do not come to Matt's Big Breakfast.\n\nYou will not enjoy the crispy, fresh hash browns. You would not like the weekend specials, such as huevos rancheros with fresh salsa, or scrambles made with seasonal, organic ingredients. A cheese and mushroom omelette will not appeal to you. They do not serve delicious Wildflower Bread toasted with most entrees. The coffee will not be piping hot and the iced tea will certainly not be tasty and delightful.\n\nAnd whatever you do, please do not order one of the waffles made from scratch. They come dusted with powdered sugar, served with warm syrup and a big scoop of butter. You probably wouldn't like it.\n\nIf, for some unknown reason, you found yourself at Matt's for lunch, you would not enjoy the Butter Burger. It would not be served on a delicious roll and topped with gooey melty cheese and a thick slice of tomato. No it wouldn't. The macaroni salad is not an excellent substitute for the kettle chips that normally accompany said Burger.\n\nFor the last time, please stay away. May I recommend you get your breakfast on at the perfectly adequate U.S-Egg-Good-Peep, or First Watch? The lines at Matt's are long enough as it is, and the regulars are getting cranky about it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt is a Kansas City native like me and like Kansas City folks knows great food.  Though breakfast is busy, it is worth the outside wait even in the middle of the summer.  The wait staff is great and always on their toes, it is fun to see the owner's wife active in the restaurant filling coffee, delivering food and following up on your experience.  Though the menu is not too long, it has all the classic greats, plus great specials.  For those who like to feel at home for breakfast, this is the place to go.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	So it begins....I have finally started reviewing all the restaurants that I tried on my tour of the Southwest this summer and Matt's Big Breakfast was a BIG way to start it off!\n\nBeing from LA which seems to be the home of trendy but good and always crowded breakfast spots, I understand the love/hate relationship that people have with their local breakfast spot that have just become way to crowded.  That being said, I left LA to try some of the favorites in other cities.  The good thing about being on vacation is that you can schedule your meals around the crowds instead of dealing with them.\n\nSo we drove into Phoenix around 11pm under the blanket of the night which was great because the days were reaching 120 degrees.  It was quieter then most cities, almost ghost-town like.  We stayed at the motel next to Matt's Big Breakfast.  I think its called the Coronado or Casablanca Hotel.  It was more of a Motel then Hotel and definitely not the Holiday Inn.  Although a little on the scary side it served its purpose.  The goal was to wake up and walk into Matt's.  And that goal was certainly achieved.  \n\nAfter a super long wait of about...3 minutes (9:30am) we sat down and took a look at the menu.  \n\nhttp://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1410-1.jpg\n\nIt wasnt as big as I thought it was going to be (haha)...well, it wasnt as expansive as I thought it was going to be but I would rather restaurants do what they do right instead of tons of things done wrong.\n\nI got the Hog & Chick and Griddle Cakes.  Thick cut bacon and perfectly made eggs with delicious potatoes.  Nice thick bread and homemade jam came along side.  Im not a fan of citrus jams/preserves but this was fantastic!\n\nhttp://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1415.jpg\n\nhttp://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1417.jpg\n\nThe pancakes were possibly the best of the trip and also some of the best I have ever had.  Everything we had was great!   Our server/owner  even came and talked to us about our trip, the town and even gave us some other suggestions on places to see and eat at while in Phoenix.  I wish I could have tried some of the places she suggested but...alas, we still had a ton of places still on our own list.  \n\nOff to Joe's Farm Grill!!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place is absolute heaven when you are hungover.  The omelets are huge and fluffy, stuffed with deliciousness.  I love the thick cut bacon!  They definitely do not skimp on the good stuff!  I was talking about it with a guy at The Roosevelt later that night and he told me Matt drives out to Gilbert once a week for that bacon.  Definitely worth it!  The hash browns are even better.  Perfectly crispy without being burned.  Matt's will definitely fill you up at a very good price.  Loved seeing Matt at The Roosevelt that night!  He's awesome!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Fantastic breakfast and very good service. The cafe is also very clean. Can't wait to come back and try something new.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Great portion size- Lunch and dinner for 7.95 :)\n\nI definitely recommend Matt's. There was a wait, but it wasn't terrible- just bring a book or play 20 questions. The bacon was delicious. I had a BLT and my boyfriend had the egg sandwich. Both were great, but the egg sandwich was AWESOME. I would get that if I went again. \n\nWorth checking out, fast service once you're seated, $20 for two of us and we both had leftovers.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Who is Matt?\nWhy is his breakfast so big?\nWhy are there lines out the door on a regular basis?\nWhy am I able to without hesitation give this place full marks?\n\nI took Kristy to this place one cold Fiesta Bowl morning when Jonny decided he needed to sleep in rather than entertain his guests!  Somehow, I remembered that I needed to arrive around 8am if I would get a seat and parking and not starve at the door.  We walked right in!\n\nThis intimate kitchen setting stashed in the middle of downtown nowhere really is the BIG attraction in the area.  Wholesomely good with organic everything and home grown and home made this and that, I found myself ooohing and aaaahing before even opening my mouth to sample the tea and grapefruit juice!  EVERYONE's food seem to lure me in and I actually had a VERY hard time selecting just one item that I wanted for breakfast.\n\nThe menu is not big. But my eyes were as a re-contemplated the implications of not getting one item or selecting another option over another.  I landed somehow on the omelette!  Original n'est pas?\nI enjoyed everything about it.  Kristy got the pancakes and coffee and is still talking about how this was the next best thing to do if  you were denied a promised road trip by a hungover friend to Sedona!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Overhyped?\nWhat am I missing here?\nI was very excited about checking out Matt's. We went on a Sunday morning, so I expected a long wait (I even brought a book).\nThere was about an hour wait ahead of us, so I was already happy it wasn't longer than that.\nThe exterior is cute. I was already giving the place a point on style alone and because the interior is oh-so tiny! \nThey had some retro looking fans going-we ended up sitting in the rear room.\nI had the eggs and sausage, with wheat toast. Meh. I wasn't crazy about the food. The prices were very reasonable though.\nMy toast was way too thick, and was more a multi-grain than a wheat (hey I know the difference). I like thin, crunchy toast, not giant slabs of semi toasted bread.\nThere is no bathroom-you have to go next door to the creepy motel to use the bathroom which is in a room .Did I mention creepy? it's super creepy.\nBack to the food. I didn't notice any size selections for the juices. I had an orange juice. It was freshly squeezed and very tasty, but oh so tiny. I could have finished it in a gulp.\nNo one read us any specials, though I did hear the people next to us were read the specials (hey maybe I wanted the steak and eggs?! At least gimme the option. hmmph).\nThe service was hurried, but not rude. Our drinks were never refreshed.. so I was licking the pulp out of my cup by my 3rd bite.\nMy husband had the belgian waffle. Again, Meh. Nothing special.\nThere was really nothing special here that would make me come back, the wait alone, though not as long as I expected, will keep me away.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	In town to visit some family.  This spot is great!  very small seat area.  The food is amazing.  I had the pork chop, Yum! Kids had the waffles.  Honestly the best things i tasted were the bacon and the pancake.  Staff was very helpful considering my family put them through their paces ( not taking them again - they don't deserve it).
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Hi all! Went to Matt's last night for the PJ's and Eggs! Matt was great a bunch of the guys from Hickman farms were there having breakfast too! The special was steak and eggs, while I originally had my little heart set on a butter burger I had to try the Steak and eggs. I was not disappointed it was fantastic! Just as I suspected. I think I am becoming a Matt's groupie! lol. I can't help it between the cozy atmosphere, the friendly staff, fresh delicious menu choices and given that I am supporting a family business I am hooked! Now I will say last night we waited about an hour and there were 5 of us but all agreed it was so worth the wait. PS I had to get a butter burger to go I had it for lunch today YUM! Thanks Erenia and Matt!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Overpriced is my first thought. Overall our food was good and service was friendly and all but I wasn't going "wow" because of the price. I don't mind paying for large portions or something super good but $7.50 for a couple pancakes is too much for my retired wallet.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'm a huge fan of matts. Have been for 2 years now. Their service is great, but more importantly their food is amazing. Always order teh home fries. My favorites are the hog and chick and the big butter burger. The only slight downfall is the wait, if it looks like there are 25 people in front of you on the list, it might be best to just go another time.  Unless you're willing to wait more than two hours.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	First off I LOVE this place! I have never been disappointed with the food or service. If you love breakfast food this is your place. You have to try the Salami Scramble with home fries (which are the best damn potatoes this side of Idaho). \nAlso, if you're lucky the special of the day might be the eggs benedict that are making me hungry just thinking about them.\n\nIf you get there around 11:00 am be prepared to wait but they will seat you pretty fast. The customer service is great and the prices are cheap! Don't come here if you want a healthy breakfast because it won't be but it will be some of the best breakfast food you will ever have!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Since breakfast isn't my favorite meal to eat out (I like to eat as soon as I get up...breakfast is yummy just rolled out of bed), I had not tried, but  only been hearing raves about Matt's Big Breakfast for literally about a year, so I knew it had to be good...good enough to try breaking my fast outside my own kitchen.\n\nLuckily it wasn't too crowded (as I'd heard it might be).  We were seated at a window counter, but then moved once our food came to a little table by the door.  The staff was ultimately accommodating to the best experience for us. \n\nThe food was beyond delicious.  Egg salad sandwich with chips (I told you I wasn't a huge breakfast-out person), a waffle, and potatoes, and chocolate milk.  It was all SO delicious!  And SO MUCH!  We were able to take most of the sandwich home for later.  By the way, the break was AMAZING...just amazing.\n\nMy favorite thing I think (besides the food) was how friendly everyone was--from the staff to the customers.  It also was cool because since Matt's is small (but not too small), you wind up talking to the people around you.  Three tables joined in our conversation to complain about State Senator Russel Pearce, who led the slaughter of AZ's education budgets particularly in Spring 2009...but that's a different story...\n\nI need to go back to Matt's soon--it was a great time.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	After hearing all of the hype on diners, drive in and dives and reading the yelp ratings, we decided to try it.  We waited over 30 minutes  for a table.  The place is small and outside of a dungy motel.  The service was extremely fast once you got in the door and the waitstaff are very friendly.  I had a waffle and it was good but nothing memorable.  My partner had an omelette with portguese sausage that he loved.  The hash browns were so buttery and they were good.  \n\nI wouldn't make a special trip back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I love this place. We've been going every Saturday for the past few months, and although there is always at least an hour wait on Saturdays the awesome food and cute cozy atmosphere has been worth it. This is definitely a gem in the heart of downtown Phoenix, I personally love the Hog and Chick which is two eggs cooked to order, three big strips of peppered bacon, your choice of hash browns or home fries and your choice of fresh baked toasted bread on the side served up with preserves from a local source. Their honey lemonade is inspired and their iced coffee is pretty good too. \n\nThey are right across the street from the Phoenix Public Market and if you want to go walk around and see the shops instead of waiting outside (for an hour) you can write 'market' by your name and you will be seated next up if you get back after you've been called. My daughter always orders the waffles and devours them and her dad keeps 'waffling' between the pancakes and the waffles but always cleans his plate (and usually some of mine as well!) the hostess is very cheery and efficient, she calls us 'Team Justin' and she always checks in with us at least once or twice during our meal.\n\nI'd definitely check this place out if you've never been, they used to be closed on Monday's but very recently that's changed and I've been told that if you want to get in WITHOUT the wait, Monday is the time to go! Happy Eating from Team Justin!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	They have Mr. Pibb. That's fun. I first read about Matt's in an America West in-flight magazine and put it on my list of places to go.\n\nYou know the wait was about 20 minutes, the staff was quick and the food was good. I would say the biggest appeal about Matt's is that it seems like the food is reliable, you go there for breakfast and guess what you get it straight up.\n\nWhat I most appreciate, is that Matt saw potential in an old downtown building and is doing his part to bring business to that part of town.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What am I missing here?  I have heard about Matt's since moving to Phoenix almost 5 years ago, but never wanted to wait outside in the heat to try it.  Now that they have moved into a bigger building, I figured I could try it.  The space is cute -- kind of a minimalist industrial theme.  I was not AT ALL impressed with the menu.  Not much to choose from, and you'll end up having to order items a la carte if you want variety in your meal (e.g., I didn't see any meals that included pancakes, a side of breakfast meat and eggs -- in fact, the pancakes don't even include a side of breakfast meat, so you have to order that a la carte).\n\nI ordered the waffle, which does come with a side of bacon, and an orange juice.  The orange juice, although fresh-squeezed and very good, had to be the smallest glass of OJ I have ever seen. It was basically a large shot glass.  At $2.50 a glass, I felt a little jilted.  The waffle was really good!  It was definitely fresh and buttery.  The bacon left a lot to be desired.  It was pretty fatty, and the pepper crust really didn't add anything to the flavor. \n\nMaybe my expectations were too high based on all of the rave reviews I have heard about Matt's, but my experience was just okay.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's was my favorite breakfast place ever but now I have to add a caveat.  Do not go to Matt's during a busy if you want to hear anything the waitress or anyone that is with you.  The food is still fabulous and it is great that you do not need to wait long but the noise level is a constant roar of voices.  Even if I was alone it is uncomfortably noisy.  I would not go there again for breakfast until at least after 9 AM .  Maybe it gets busy again for the lunch crowd but I have never been there  after 10:30AM
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The good thing about going here alone ...its practically no wait. I came in got a seat right at the bar. Yay for me.  I order a coffee omg it was delicious home grown natural. I ordered the special three egg scramble with sundried tomato chicken sausage, button mushrooms and local baby organic spinach and fontina serve with potatoes and toast.  I also order a side of Bacon because I had to try it. THIS PLACE FOOD was so good and filling.. I will definently come back here when I come back to Phoenix.. It was very much worth the drive.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We heard this was the best breakfast place in the Phoenix area so we had to check it out.\n\nThe long wait wasn't fun, but we figured if that many people were willing to wait almost an hour (10:30am on a Saturday, go figure), then it must be good.\n\nIt did not disappoint. The waffles were great, but my favorite was the homefries!\n\nIt was small and quaint and we had good service with a friendly staff.\n\nOh yeah, and they serve RC Cola, which made it even a better experience for me.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Very impressed w the food, just know b4 hand the wait was almost and hour long and this was on a Thursday b4 noon. I can see why people will wait. The downfall is that now when I have breakfast, the first thing that I think is "matts, is the best breakfast place I have ever been too" :p \n\nCan't wait to be back!\n\nPs Guy from dives and diners was there! :D
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Went to Matt's after checking on Yelp when we landed at Phoenix airport.  It seemed like a nice place to eat based on the reviews.\nThe restaurant is very small and located on an unassuming street corner just south of downtown.  Free parking is difficult to find so bring change for parking meters that are in abundance.  We arrived at around 9 in the morning and it was already warm, and yes there is a wait outside.  There is also not much shade other than a couple of umbrellas and the overhang.  I can't imagine really long waits.  By the way, don't go inside to sign up.  You put your name on a note pad outside of the door and they'll come out to get you when it is your turn.  Our wait on an off-day was about 15-20 minutes.  (Update:  Looks like they have moved).\n\nThe room for us inside was counter-seating next to the register.  It was a tad bit cramped and we didn't have a lot of space to wiggle since we were dealing with servers passing by us constantly.  The service was attentive and pleasant.  All the servers seemed like they were college co-eds but they did not lack any kind of customer service quality.  They buzzed around with purpose and had no problems with menus, rude customers, or getting around the cramped quarters of the establishment.  \n\nThe food is excellent.  We shared a three egg omelet with chicken apple sausage and local hot peppers that was one of the best I've tasted.  The pancakes were fluffy and delicious, and the side of pepper bacon complemented everything perfectly.  The star of the meal is the home fries; an amalgamation of potatoes, buttery goodness, and rosemary.  They are scrumptious beyond belief.  \n\nOverall the experience at Matt's was excellent, and maybe the new building will allow for better parking and less wait time.  And while the food was outstanding, the conditions for waiting, the parking, and the cramped spaces inside only warrant 4 stars.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Place is crazy good. Breakfast favorites that don't skimp on flavor...or saturated fats. Isn't that what breakfast is all about. If you're only going to eat out breakfast a few times a month, this is the spot. \n\nDon't be fooled by other Phoenix Yelp haters..."too loud", "not worth the price", "I want to love this place, but...", same old tired reviews left at all of PHX's favorite restaurants. Check this place out, grab a coffee while you wait, and hope the Matt wants to expand the operation.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	If you love a classic American breakfast, Matts is the best in Phx hands down. I've only been once, mostly because its downtown and the long lines. All their ingredients are local, organic, and farm raised. Their bacon is something I always tell people to try. Its insanely thick and peppered to perfection! I would go there just for a side of bacon! Their toast is thick and baked fresh. Even their OJ is fresh squeezed. I wish I lived downtown because I would go here every weekend!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's Big Breakfast is a nice, quaint little breakfast joint that does breakfast very well. A friend and I came here this morning and we were very much pleased with the food, the atmosphere, and the service.\n\nWe both ordered the day's special. It was a apple sausage scramble with spinach, a helping of hash browns, and some toast. Everything about the dish was very well done. The eggs were scrambled just right so that they were buttery, a lil creamy, and very fluffy. The apple sausage was just alright. It wasn't bursting with flavor and could've used a lil more heat or smokiness or something. \n\nThe hash browns are worth raving about though. The top layer of hash browns were crazy crispy which is always a good thing. But beneath the crust were some great gooey gluey but not soggy potatoes that perfectly complimented the crisp of the outside. The crisp:gooey ratio was flawless!\n\nEven the toast was fantastic. Went with sourdough. Always do and forever will. The jam was made with fresh berries. The toast was thick and well-buttered. Went great with the freshly made jam.\n\nAll-in-all it was a good breakfast experience. It wasn't the best breakfast in the world. It wasn't super phenomenal or mind-blowing. But it was certainly above average so I'll give it 4 stars.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Good but not worth the wait, we waited over 2 hours for a party of 3.  Very nice staff and place looks clean.  Nothing really stood out to justify that type of wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Food was okay, I am not waiting all day for it though.  If I could go in and get a table right away I'd eat here again, but waiting more than 10 minutes, no thank you!  I would rather walk to Matadors or First Watch....\n\nP.S. Go for the rosemary potatoes not the hash browns, unless, of course, you would like some hash browns with your grease.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Thanks to Guy Fieri of FoodNetwork fame, this place was at the top of my list for a weekend getaway to Phoenix/Scottsdale! My friend and I drove directly from the airport to Matt's, which turned out to be in a rather desolate location but easy enough to find. Our timing was just right because we arrived a little before noon and were seated within minutes.\n\nSince I'd been up since dawn and not had a proper meal, I went all out and ordered the Hog and the Chick (choice of pork product with eggs), plus a side of the pancakes! It was all fantastic--just wish I could have finished it. The bacon was tasty and the griddlecakes were amazing! They had this wonderful texture, substantial but still light, tasted of corn, and stood up to the syrup. I hate when pancakes go all soggy with syrup, but these didn't. They just stayed delicious to the last bite. Yum!\n\nWill definitely go back if I'm ever in Phoenix again.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Definitely worth the wait if you're a breakfast person. The hash browns were amazing. I hope to go back again very soon.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Perhaps if I waited outside in the heat for an hour plus to the point that I became starved and dehydrated, I too would have thought Matt's was worthy of 5 stars. Or maybe the 5 star reviews come from people too ashamed to admit that they wasted most of their morning on a very average breakfast.\n\nIn my case, we came here before 7am on a Friday and got the last available seats by the window. Service was great; I didn't detect any attitudes from the waitstaff that has been mentioned in some reviews. They got our meal out quickly and made sure our coffee mugs never got empty.\n\nWith the exception of the toast and jam, the food never rose above "good." Isn't that pretty sad that the best offering from a breakfast diner is the bread? I liked my waffle since it was a bit crisper than what I can do at home with my geriatric waffle iron, but there was nothing noteworthy about the flavor. My husband said his eggs were cooked perfectly with his chop and chick dish, but the pork chop was under-seasoned. He found the hashbrowns way too greasy to be enjoyable, and the bacon suffered from being overcooked.\n\nMaybe we're spoiled since we have two great breakfast places within walking distance (Joe's Farm Grill and the Coffee Shop). Matt's just isn't worth the drive or wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	A-OK is right and the hype is not always worth the wait. I will keep it simple since there are probably 500 reviews on the place.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat Hashbrowns, and made from scratch food\n\nGood specials to keep things mixed up\n\nGreat company and service\n\nCons:\n\nGuy up front says a little over 35 minutes but really means an hour and 45 minutes\n\nPricey for some dishes\n\nInteresting people around while you wait to get inside (street walkers, etc.)\n\nthe fresh squeezed orange juice is enough liquid to maybe fill up a double shot glass\n\nOverall I would love to give this place more stars if I could get in there without wanting to eat a finger due to starvation, and leave a bit more satisfied. Anyone who has eaten at Bryan's in San Diego would know what I mean.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Went for breakfast on a Friday. Waited a hour and a half to be seated, but it was worth the wait.  Breakfast here isn't fancy, just good.  They specialize in fresh pork products. I had the homemade country sausage and eggs. My son had the pork chop and eggs.  Both were very tasty.  We also split an order of griddle cakes.  They were light and fluffy. Overall, a great breakfast establishment, but plan on waiting. I can only imagine how long the wait is on weekends. Kudos to Elena, she does a great job of making sure things run smoothly and that patrons are taken care of.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I CANNOT believe that I have not rated this place yet... what the?!?!? I LOVE it here. Every time I have tried something different and every time I  am glad I did. This place is not only great but everyone is nice.  Ive even waited outside in the summer...that alone should say something!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	When we are in Phoenix  for business we tend to eat breakfast here. The food is yummy, the place is small and Matt tends to be around to say hey and help serve up the grub. I like the oatmeal of all things...my husband really likes the scrambles. I love that it's small and homey the food is good and it's not too pricey. Also, I love to give my business to ma and pa places as opposed to, say...IHOP or Denny's. (YUCK)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I was sooooo disappointed!  I really cannot rate the food as I never got to eat. I live in Tucson and my family is mostly in the east  valley of Phoenix and I have been waiting for 2 years to go into downtown and eat at Matt's. I go and put my name on the waiting list. Other parties of 2 come after me and the guy kept sitting people that had been there for 20-30 minutes and I had been waiting exactly 1 hour. What really upset me is that I saw him seat 3 people at tables for 2 and when I walked in said he couldn't sit 3 there when there were others seated that way (i think he knew them).  I am truly disappointed as I've been waiting like I said for "2" years to eat there. If you have a party of more than 2, like a mere 3, you'll wait forever!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Been wanting to come here since it was featured on Food Networks Diners, Drive-Ins& Dives. Guy Fieri knows good food so this was the first place I thought of when my parents wanted to grab breakfast in Phoenix. Luckily, on a Monday afternoon, we avoided the rush, and only waited 5 minutes! Score! Now on to the grub.\n\nA lot of the food here is locally grown, they use cage-free eggs, and they even make their own jam/preservatives. I loved everything we ordered. Pancakes were different- they are very sweet- no need for any syrup. The hash browns were very good, but very heavy- and a bit soggy (which I actually prefer). The toast is large, freshly baked, and served with real butter. (nothing beats real butter!) My pork chop was very tasty and seasoned just right. Also, our server was a sweetheart, very helpful and patient. \n\nTip- try the homemade berry lemonade if available\nTip- call ahead to find out about the wait- avoid the rush! \nTip- as mentioned in almost all other reviews, this place is very tiny- not a good for large parties or the claustrophobic.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This is a true breakfast/quick lunch spot. If you go in there with 6 people, you dont get it. If youre mad you had to wait 30 minutes for a 2 top, you dont get it. If you dont put your name down, YOU DONT GET IT! But if you can just show up, put your name on a list, and patiently wait till it gets called you will be privied to one of the best b-fast joints in town. Everything from top to bottom just tastes fresh (mostly because their product is almost all locally provided). The Chop an Chick is a great place to start, a hearty pork chop that has been marinating in some sort of love, most of the breakfasts are served with your choice of gold potatoes with rosemary and onions, or hashbrowns, eggs, and toast from Tammy Co. Bakery, they also serve it with fresh preservatives. The special is always good and always different! All in all I drive 25 minutes to this place atleast once a month and I have yet to have any sort of dissapointment once. If you ask, wheres my toast, YOU DONT GET IT!!!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	After finally going I definitely believe all the hype. Everything I got was delicious; the pancakes, waffle, eggs, bacon, hash browns and even fresh squeezed orange juice. I got there at 9:20 on a Sunday and there was about an hour wait, but it was well worth it. \n\nIt is a very small restaurant, but that obviously does not stop the people from enjoying their great food. The service was on point, our food came out right away and when I ordered some extra things, that came out right away too. I would definitely like to try their lunch menu as well.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	After standing in line a few minutes on a weekday, we made our way to the bar, I ordered up some pancakes. I should have had the special which turned out to look really good. The pancakes were alright, not great but OK. One thing about pancakes they are designed to need syrup, after all a pancake is a syrup delivery system. The pancakes came with about 1 ounce, about half of a shot glass of syrup. I knew right off that wasn't going to get it done but I figured no problem I would just ask for some more. I asked for more syrup and the lady wanted to make sure I understood they charge $1.50 for syrup, I said bring it on after all what good are pancakes without syrup. The refill came and it was probably about 1/2 an ounce of syrup. I ate most of the pancakes but ended up leaving some since pancakes without syrup is boring.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Very good, if you're looking for fancy decor you won't find it here.  If you are looking for a delicious well cooked breakfast, this has to be one of the best places in Phoenix.  I had the Hog and Chick very fulfilling meal.  Only thing I didn't like was the parking situation, not good.  Parking meters in front bring change.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Never before in my life have I tasted breakfast this good. The place is small (very small), expect to wait around an hour on the weekends.\n\nOnce you get in here try the "Hog and Chick", I suggest you get the hash browns over the potatoes, and you MUST MUST MUST try the bacon! (if you're a vegan - let it go for one day!) \n\nTheir waffles are to die for too.\n\nAnother 100 places like this and Downtown Phoenix will be THE place to live!!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Peppered bacon and sweet cream butter griddle cakes.  Mmmmm.  The griddle cakes get this nice little crispy edge on them.  Can I get a big woooooot wooooot!!!  MBB is an awesome LITTLE joint to stop at for breakfast.  I stress little because while the food is tall in stature, the place is small small small.  If you're going to go on the weekend, go early.  You probably have much less chance of a wait during the week.  \n\nDefinitely a hot spot for breakfast in Phoenix.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I've sadly become one of those people who turn to the Food Network for restaurant recommendations. Okay, not all the time but when a segment airs about thick cut bacon and huge burger patties cooked in butter, I immediately start making travel plans.\n\nWe arrived at Matt's for a late-lunch. Being that it was a weekday and close to 2pm, the restaurant was nearly empty and we didn't have to endure the wait or the harried service. In fact, other than a mix-up with toast, the staff was attentive and eager to please (or get us out so they could go home).\n\nI ordered the jalapeno burger with kettle chips and Jules got the Hog & Chick - 2 eggs with bacon. Her hash browns were buttery and sweet. My burger was juicy with a nice kick.\n\nI don't know if I'll jump on the plane the next time I see a tempting food segment but am I glad that we made a trip for some bacon and burger? You bet.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Food was great. Eggs were perfect, delicious pancakes. Very nice servers. Not worth the wait in the summer months. We sat/stood in 90 degree weather for 45 min with minimal shade and seating. No waiting room inside. I'd go again when it cools off
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ok, someone please explain something to me, WHAT ON EARTH HAS MADE THIS PLACE SO POPULAR????? I went to check this place out after seeing it on DDD. It looked interesting and the food looked like it could be pretty good. Well, not to sound mean or anything but, I can make much better breakfast in my own kitchen for about half the price. Any Denny's in America makes a better breakfast and you don't have to wait in line for an hour and a half either. Im sorry but I just don't get it. The only thing that "wasn't" completely average was the bacon. The portions were WAY to small and the food was WAY, WAY over priced. "Good food, good portion size, good price". This place breaks all 3 of those rules. Come on people lets stop following the crowd and lets try and open our minds a little. If everyone would do that I don't think Matts would be in business much longer.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I have wanted to visit Matt's for quite some time now. My attempts have always been thwarted due to the extraordinary lines, the lack of time, and a growling stomach. Today, finally, I remedied that situation and finally ate at Matt's.\n\nIs Matt's overhyped? Perhaps. The small venue nearly guarantees a long wait. Is the food worth it? That is always a matter of opinion, but in mine, I think it was. I ordered the pancakes, pancakes that happened to be lightest and fluffiest I have probably ever eaten. For a side, I chose the cranberry walnut toast. It was good, as expected. Toast is hard to mess up unless obviously burnt. The friend who ate with me ordered the special that day, an egg scramble with sausage, havarti, and sweet peppers and rosemary. After sampling a bite, I wish I had ordered the special instead. The pancakes were good, but the special was great.\n\nWill I go back to Matt's? The answer is yes, though realistically it may not happen for a while due to the typical long wait times. Given the fact a wait is common, it might be a nice add to offer free WiFi or free coffee service outside for those waiting.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Went to Matt's Big Breakfast before our morning flight out of PHX airport after seeing reviews here.   We were lucky to find them open on Monday since they were not open Mondays in the past.\n\nThere was no wait for our party of two and were promptly greeted and informed of the daily special.  The waitress was very nice and attentive. \n\nI had the special which was a three egg scramble with canadian bacon and locally grown asparagus along with home fries.  K had the eggs, bacon, and hash browns.  Both meals came with toast and preserves.  Both the wheat and sourdough toast were thick slices and very fresh.  Everything was  fresh and tasty.  (Total bill $22.)\n\nWe will definitely be stopping back here in future trips to the area as it was a delicious meal.  I highly recommend this place to anyone although it is so very small that it is a good idea to get there early (they open at 630) seeing as we got there at 730 and by 815 there was a line to sit.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I won't lie. I had been dying to try Matt's Big Breakfast ever since I saw it on DDD years ago. Since I live in NorCal, and the only reason for me to visit the Phoenix area is MLB spring training, Matt's has remained an elusive temptation, taunting me from afar. \n\nSo when I decided, after a 20 year absence, to take another trip to baseball's March mecca, I knew that a visit to Matt's was on my short "must do" list. I LOVE breakfast, and I am willing to wait for a good one.\n\nIt was a little intimidating to roll up and see the hoard of people waiting outside the restaurant on a Tuesday morning, but we put our name on the list and took our place amongst the throng.\n\nWe were seated after a wait of just under an hour and the waitress arrived promptly to take our order. My dining buddy and I both ordered the Hog and Chick, she with soft scrambled eggs, sausage and homefries, and I with over medium eggs, bacon and hash browns. We also decided to split a waffle. The homefried potatoes were good, but the hash browns were out of this world-- crispy on the top and bottom and soft and buttery in between. Seriously the best hash browns I've ever had. The bacon was thick and peppery, and lthough the waffle was tasty, I would have preferred it to have a crispier outside. The hand sliced whole wheat toast with homemade strawberry jam was perfect.\n\nI've been to a few places featured on Food Network, and though some of them haven't lived up to expectations, a few of them are home runs (Voula's Offshore Cafe, The Squeeze Inn, Bette's Oceanview Diner). Matt's knocks it out of the park.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I finally made the great Breakfast pilgrimage.  It was worth every minute of the wait.  We put in our names, and walked over to the downtown market to kill some time.  We still had to wait about 15 minutes after that, but it was a great way to go.  Highly suggest it.  \n\nThe best pancakes I've ever had.  Ever.  And the home fries?  I could eat just a big bowl of that and be happy.  Great rosemary taste.  Really loved the coffee. Yummy peppery bacon.  One of our companions said the ham was the best she'd had since she's lived in Tennessee more than 15 years ago.  \n\nRight before we left, we saw someone served a hamburger and we could hardly move.  It was the best looking burger I've ever seen.  We will TOTALLY be back just for lunch. Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmmm...  \n\nBut Matt himself cracking jokes with the patrons and chatting with downtown neighbors walking by was awesome.  While the food felt made with love, the big guy's personality totally put it over the top. You love supporting him supporting downtown.  Its the kind of business you would almost like to go even if it wasn't that good.  But thank goodness - it is that good.  Can't wait to go back.  \n\nVery.  Very.  Soon.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Told this was the best in town so made multiple attempts to go, but left twice because the wait was over 2 hrs... When we finally caught them on an odd morning when the wait was reasonable, found the food was good but not worth the hype.  Plus, had to ask 3 times for my side waffle, and when it was brought out she poured the syrup all over me and made only a half effort to clean it up.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The food was good but the 45 minute wait ruined my experience.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This is another place I've seen on Triple D on FoodTV.  The breakfast definitely lives up to it's name - Big Breakfast.  The portions are pretty hearty.  The only downside to this place is it's really, really small and the wait can be very, very long.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Okay, I think I was a dick the first time I wrote a review of Matt's, so i'll try again.\n\nI don't like lines.  No, I mean I really don't like lines and I have horrible Disney World nightmares that sometimes wake me up.  Despite my hatred of lines, I love Matt's and I dream of Matt's, too, and sometimes I even find myself in line at Matt's in the blazing heat, waiting for those wonderful pancakes and floating like Bugs Bunny to a carrot.  I think I said something silly in my last review, like, "I won't go back for months because of the lines," but I was back and I felt guilty, so I'm rewriting the review to assuage my guilt and allow me a future guilt-free experience as I devour their pancakes.\n\nI wasn't kidding about the scooter gang, though.  Seriously, there was a scooter gang in line.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I love Matt's big breakfast. I don't go there all the time. But any place that makes me drive a pretty good distance and wait in line just for breakfast! Must be doing something right. Went there this morning with my girlfriend. And we was greeted by a cute and very intelligent kid that was the owners son. Didn't have to wait to long but it was a nice day. I always get the griddlecakes when I go there. Ive never had anything even close to there's anywhere else. I can't give it 5 stars because of the wait and because its pretty small in there. And its always kind of weird eating breakfast next to a big window where people who are waiting outside can sit there and stare at you. I feel like im on display at a zoo eating. But those are minor gripes. I go to Matts for the food and the food never disappoints.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Oh Matt, \nWhy-O, why-O did you have to move? Who cares that your old place was small? It was part of the quaint location. No matter.....your food is still worth waiting in the beaming heat. Keep it up with the 'no microwave' & local produce kitchen. Cheers!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's Big Breakfast:\n\nYes it's busy.  Yes it's tiny.  And yes there's a 45 min. wait on a weekday @ 10:30.  Don't you people work?!  \n\nBut you know what?  All these things add to the charm of the place.  I secretly believe that people like to wait, they love the anticipation, people eat that sh*t up.  \n\nNow, with that being said, on to the food, it truly is delicious. There is no hype when the restaurant can actually deliver and prove that it was worth every minute of the wait. \n\nLemonade: fresh squeezed and flavored with honey.  A natural sweetener that is incredibly refreshing on a hot day. \n\nWaffle: most definitely the best waffle I have ever had.  Fluffy, light, piping hot, real butter and real maple syrup. \n\nOmelet: quite possibly the best omelet I have ever had.  Cooked to perfection with American cheese, mushrooms and bacon.  No skimping on these additions either, large button mushrooms, plenty of cheese and large chunks of thick cut bacon. \n\nThe bottom line....\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast:\n\nBig on taste.  Big on portions.  Big on appeal.  Even bigger on charm.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This was the first time I had gone to Matt's Big Breakfast. I had heard some amazing things about it, outside of the fact that the wait times were horrendous, due to the fact that their original location was SO small. Low and behold, they opened up a second location, more than twice the size of their original one (still pretty small to be honest), so we HAD to try it. \n\nWe arrived at 7am on a Saturday morning, thinking we'd have NO issues getting in THAT early. We were wrong. We waited an hour or so... it could have been a longer wait though since our whole party didn't show up til 7:15ish. After the long anticipated wait, we finally ordered! Let me just mention, you really can't substitute or make many changes, if any, to your order. I ordered pancakes and wanted some blueberries, but was told no, lol. Regardless, the pancakes were super delicious! And they came with real maple syrup. Side note... use the syrup sparingly, asking for any extra will cost you an additional $1.50 :P\n\nOn another note, I heard their eggs benedict was AMAZING! Sadly, it's only a special and it wasn't on the day I went. I may just have to go again to try it!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The Chop and the Chick..............oh my pesto encrusted pork chop will I ever get to have you again? It was over 100 degrees, it was over an hour wait, but they keep ice water outside so you don't die, and, in my opinion, its worth the wait to experience dining inside- at least once. After that if you wanna come back, just order your goods to go. \n\nBut back to the pork chop.......it was incredible. It was perfectly cooked, and sometimes Porkchops are hit or miss when it comes to moist and dry. But this chop was plump and moist and pesto-y and out of this world. The ambiance and decor of this place was retro-vintage-mod, mostly white w/little but unique decor.  I loved my dining experience there, from the service to the food.  I'd definitely come back!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	So until today I didn't know there was a lot of hype about this place.  Ashley L. suggested it and I said sure why not.  While waiting for her in the parking lot, doors locked and windows up, I decided to look at it on Yelp.  Wow was there a lot of reviews.  \nSo we got there early and there was no wait.  I guess that is rare.  We both got The Hog and Chick with bacon and sourdough bread she got eggs over hard and I got them scrambled and we shared a stack of pancakes.  I have to admit that the food was really good.  I am not saying this because others have said it but because it is my own opinion.  Like I said I didn't even know it existed until she suggested it.  The service was great and we had a great experience. \nMy only problem is the size.  It is tiny.  Wow.  There is a place on the west side known as The Place and it used to be in a small location and moved to a larger one.  Much easier to get in and the food is still great.  They may stay there because it feels quaint but that I think was the only flaw I saw.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ugh!  I thought maybe I should try this place again before I slam it on Yelp, but after reading some of the other one- and two-star reviews, I realize I'm not nuts.  And there is no way I'm going to wait for hours to give this place another chance.  If you want to wait in line for two hours and then receive a cup of grease along with your hash browns and eggs, then Matt's is the place for you.  Disgusting!  Not to mention the bathroom is next door in a hotel room.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	An hour and a half wait...I thought after seeing this on DDD (from the Food Network) that it has to be pretty darn good considering how they raved about it. Was wrong to believe them. It was normal breakfast food that just tasted fresher than what you could eat at Denny's. Not sure why people are obsessed with it. I guess for that long of a wait you expect very yummy food and it was a let down.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Drove all the way from long beach california for this joint, and it was totally worth the drive. I got the waffle with bacon and a side of of rosemary potatoes. it was amazing and the best breakfast i have ever eaten. Every time i go to AZ i will eat here amazing!!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Yay, finally got to try this place today. I had the waffle which came with two slices of bacon and I added an overeasy egg. Best Belgian style waffle I have ever had. It really is amazing. Butter was tasty and I even loved their syrup (I normally despise syrup). Their syrup lacked that really pungent smell that usually makes me a little sick. And it was a lot thinner than most syrups I've seen. Very yummy. You can tell everything is really fresh. Would highly recommend it. Service was friendly and came around frequently, but the wait and metered parking knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Hands down it is the best Breakfast place in the phoenix metro. I came all the way from Maricopa, AZ to check this place out. I'm not a native Arizonan, but this place competes up there with all the breakfast places I've been to. The pork chop is is awesome! I was lucky enough to be the last guy that made it through the door when it opened hehe.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My SJ buddies and I came here for breakfast one weekday morning.  Now I know why Matt's gets such great reviews.  The only draw back to Matt's is that it is just so small.  But then again, that is part of it's charm.  This is a tiny little house on a corner in downtown Phoenix.  I can just imagine what the weight is like on the weekends.  They have great fresh food and coffee.  I had the "Hog an Chick" meat and eggs....applewood smoked bacon...YUM!!  And the potatoes reminded me of my Uncle Ernie's potatoes.  So good with herbs and onions.  I gobbled up every bite!!  My coffee cup was never empty and the sourdough toast was .....mmmmm toasty.  I loved Matt's.  Just be sure to bring lots of quarters because there is nothing but metered parking all around.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Short on menu, long on taste. A small diner, with a great small town atmosphere rules the morning meals. \n\nI got a recommendation from a collegue who like me was hungry for a good meal to get the day started. That said a short walk from the hotel, we quickly found a place with a crowd surrounding it. \n\nWe signed in and found a place outside to sit and wait. Friday morning, 9 am, we waited about 20 minutes. \n\nThe tables are small, their glasses of orange juice aren't very large, however it was freshly squeeed from what I could tell. \n\nWe both had the special, and it was a nicely portioned meal that filled is both up without regret. Their fasted fresh, and it was full of flavor. It was perfect for the morning.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Good food...good service...bad location...long wait. The food gives it the xtra star. Triple D...c'mon man!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	words can not describe the goodness that is matt's big breakfast. i came out here while on business/vacation and had matt's waffle. i have since been on a tear back here in L.A. looking for a waffle of equal caliber, but to no avail. \n\nlight, fluffy, perfectly sweet. i've even contemplated braving the 120 degree + weather just to savor the waffle that obliterates all other waffles.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Long wait (40 minutes) on a Friday morning. Guess it's due to limited seating capacity. But the Five Spot and home fries were delicious!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Like most great places, a review isn't necessary, so I haven't done so.  My latest visit gave me the need to do so, though.  I needn't say what's already been said, as most of the reviews are the same.\n\n1) You will wait, no matter what time of day or time of year.  Hot summer mornings, early, will have the shortest wait.  If you've never been here, what you do is show up, write down your name and the number of people in your party, snag some water and find some shade.  It's suggested you have good company or a book - you can get bored waiting!\n\n2) All the food is good.  All the food is fresh.  If there is a daily special, get it.\n\n3) Everyone rants and raves about the potatoes.  I could remove one star just to prove a point, but this is a five star place.  The hashbrowns are good because of the potatoes.  They are extremely fresh and full-flavored, unlike anything you get at most restaurants.  That said, they're not the *WORLDS GREATEST HASHBROWNS EVERRRRRRRRRRRR*.  They're fantastic, but they are a bit mushy on the inside.  They are possibly the very best potatoes in town, all said and done.\n\n4) Four Barrel coffee is served here now, instead of Cave Creek.  I'm all for this.  Despite it not being local, it is better than a lot of local roasts.\n\n5) Go here.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ok, so I have heard all the hype over Matt's and just never thought to go, as I don't usually have the patience to wait 2 hours to eat.  Fortunately, the missus and I had this morning off together and thought it might be easier to get in for breaky.  The wait was about 15 minutes when we got there, which is nothin.  We were seated at the table why the window and were greeted promptly.  I had a coffee and we both had fresh squeezed oj.  We both opted for the cheese omelette with mushrooms and onions, I had whole grain toast and she had sourdough that was served with house-made preserves (the bread, I learned, comes from Wildflower Bakery) and it was soooo effing good!  The hashbrowns were magical, all golden brown delicious on the outside and soft and gooey in the middle. We also shared a waffle for a breakfast-style dessert.  It was very good and I will definitely go back for more!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	There's little more to say that hasn't already been said.\n\nMatt's has very familiar items on their menu, but each that I've tried really is impressively delicious!\n\nExpect to wait...if you're impatient there are plenty of others who are willing to wait (me included) for 40+ minutes on a very empty stomach.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The wait was REALLY long, but we were prepared by the other reviews. I like that you give your order before you go in so you get your food right away. However, the food is only a step above other, more convenient places. I'm over it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Well I have heard the hype, seen it on DDD and viewed the lines wrapped around the block. A few friends raved about this place. I should have taken note to "who" of my friends were raving about it. They tend to eat anything.\n\nI will not say the food is bad. It is actually good. However, nothing that requires this much attention. I grew up in NYC and we had tons of great diners serving bkfst, lunch, dinner and late late night meals. The food is freshly made. The most impressive thing on my visit was the fresh squeezed o.j. It was perfect.\n\nThe menu is small and I swear they don't have a green veggie or fruit in that place. It is carb and fat overload. The portions are huge. But I know this is what some people like and what they go for.\n\nI was bamboozled by a friend into going here. He suggested lunch and was paying. Of course I will be gracious and go where he wants to go. I guess a part of me wanted to see what all the hype was about. \n\nI don't usually eat this type of food, which might be the problem right there. I don't get excited off plates full of pork, flour, syrup, carbs and more carbs. After waiting 30 mins or so I was hungry and decided that I will pay for the meal ltr by a kick butt hike. Well lets just say no hike happened. I took an extended nap ltr that day. That heavy food sucked the living energy out of me for two days. Ohh Matt your big breakfast was so not for me. \n\nIf this is your kind of food I am sure you will enjoy it. If you don't eat this way often be prepared to feel like you ate a ton of bricks the next few days.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We waited a little less than 2 hours at Matt's- we went on a Saturday morning around 10:00am. I ordered the 5 spot with hash browns. \nThe hash browns were really good, thin & crispy. I didn't really like my sandwich that much, it was ok. I didn't really cAre too much for the grilled onions & thick bacon....I think I prefer thinner crispier bacon? All in all I wouldn't wait 2 hours again to eat here- it seemed average to me but glad I tried it. Oh & one last thing I didn't like that they didn't have free refills on beverages...it was sold by the bottle or can.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Well, here it is folks. My first 3-star rating since starting this project (http://www.hngrysam.com/?p=20) about four months ago. And I'm sure I'll get some flack for it!\n\nI met a friend at Matt's for breakfast around 9am on a Saturday. I expected a wait, and a wait we got. It wasn't too bad, there were benches and shade and lots of conversation. After about 30 minutes we were seated at the bar inside the teeny tiny restaurant.\n\nI loved the simple old-school vibe. We ordered and our food came out FAST, which was nice since we'd been waiting a bit. The food was simple and good, and the service was really great. But why all the hype?  Is it rude of me to give a lesser rating because the place doesn't hold up to the Yelp standard?\n\nI will absolutely give it a second chance, but I fear Matt's might be one of those places people love because other people love it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	There is no "big breakfast". Matt told me himself. What you will get is a delicious, fresh, locally grown breakfast served by really nice people. Line was super long and I thought servings were average so I gave it three stars. Really nice place and I definately recommend it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I thought this place was great! The wait wasn't that long at all, coming from NY I have seen alot worse. The actual restaurant itself is very small, obvious reason for the wait.  I ordered the Special of the Day - Huevos Rancheros along with an order of Griddle Cakes, both were quite delicious. Overall, the only negative was the wait which again wasn't as bad I was expecting.  \nI definitely will come back to this place, guaranteed a good breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My favorite breakfast place.  Love the food, love the prices, love the decor.  But...\n\nHATE THE WAIT.\n\nThey know me.  My wife and I bring our two small kids here every week or two.  But our AVERAGE wait time, sitting in front on nice modernist benches, is about 25 minutes.  \n\nIt sucks.  I wish they would get rid of two rows of parking, put up an overhead tent with heaters/misters.\n\nBut I think the fact that people have to wait actually increases the love of the place?  Strange, huh.\n\nFood is delicious.  I love the aged cheese omelet.  Go for the home fries, which are delicious and dusted with fresh rosemary, over the overly buttery hash browns.  Almost everything on the menu is perfect.  My kids do a single pancake, perfectly cooked, with great syrup.  \n\nTheir bread may be the best part.  Fresh, thick cut bread with butter and fresh jam/jelly.\n\nLook, it's a slightly upscale "diner food" that is well worth every $ you spend and every calorie you consume.  \n\nI hate to give a good review... what if even MORE people come and my wait is even LONGER... :(
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'm an avid food network watcher, and heard about this little breakfast joint from both Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and Phoenix Magazine's "Best Of" issue. I'd actually tried it once before last summer and been only mildly impressed...To read about the experience that changed my mind, visit my food blog:\n\nhttp://eatinganddrinkingacrosstheusa.blogspot.com/2011/07/downtown-phoenix-az.html
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'd been waiting for the perfect time to experience Matt's.  This Wednesday morning I felt like that time had come.  I figured Wednesday at 11am shouldn't have much of a wait.  It didn't, and we were seated within 10-15 minutes.  The place is cute and the service is really great once you get seated (until then everyone looks kinda rushed and annoyed by you).  \n\nOur experience had it's high points:\n*Our extremely sweet server (love those glasses)\n*The ridiculously good coffee\n*and the novelty of eating in a shoe box.\n\nI got the Hog and Chick with Bacon.  It was yummy, but...gasp....nothing to wait an hour and a half for like most people do on the weekends.  Yes the bacon was thick cut, and the preserves for the toast were lovely, but still, I actually had a hard time picking something off of the menu because nothing seemed to jump out at me as unique or unmissable.  \nOne thing's for sure though, they do the classics well.\nFor me, the above high points are enough to bring me back again, and hopefully next time the special will rock my socks off.  \n\nMatt and Ernie have a great group of concepts, thanks for bringing downtown up a notch.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Average at best.  I have been here 3 times, primarily based on all the hype and wanting to be sure that I was giving Matt's a fair shake.  Listen, it's not terrible...but it's just nothing special at all.  The menu is basic and unimaginative.  I guess I would expect some creativity in the menu selections for such a "hot spot," but alas there is none.  The execution is ok, but not great.  I thought the hash browns were terrible (greasy and overdone) and the rest of it was quite ordinary, if not excessively greasy.  It's small and crowded.  The service was generally fine.  I also thought it was a bit overpriced...particularly the OJ, which I think was like $4 for a tiny glass of what seemed to be made-from-concentrate OJ.  Anyway, I think I'm done with this place.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I was so very excited to eat here as I had been trying for a number of years.  The wait was not bad and we were seated within 30 minutes on a Thursday morning.\n\nEveryone was polite and this being a very tiny spot everything was quick.\nI ordered the waffle and bacon and my mom had the ham and cheese omelet. WOW is all I can say we were both impressed and I really enjoyed the waffle and the thick sliced bacon.\n\nI really really enjoyed the thick sliced bread with the strawberry preserves and the omelet was amazing. Also the chocolate milk was very very good.\n\nIf your in phoenix I cant say enough that you should try Matt 's for friendly service and great food. It is worth the wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Don't be turned off by the location and size. Good things come in small packages.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I think Matt's genius is knowing where to get good ingredients and not messing it up.  I was blown away by the peppered bacon and the rosemary home fries. The waffle was good, but didn't reach the amazing wonder that was the bacon.\n\nBut if you're planning for a weekend pilgrimage then prepare yourself well for a super duper long wait, followed by quick rush out of the tiny diner space as soon as you're done with your food.   \n\nIf you want a nice leisurely brunch then go some place with more seating, or you can take the drive down to Queen Creek and stock up on that incredibly delicious pepper bacon from the Pork Shop.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Worth the 30 minute wait in 105 deg Phoenix!!  Everything is fabulous!\nHad the bacon & eggs (Hog & Chick)...absolutely best bacon & eggs I've ever had.  High quality food and I'm not even a breakfast person.  Griddle cakes were fluffy and delicious.  Homemade bread for their toast and fresh farmers market cherry jam for spread.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Good occasion get some friends together who are virgin Matt's BB goers and we waited about 40 min for our table which ultimately wasn't too bad as we got seated in the private VIP nook at the front of their newly located establishment. The decor was plain and simple and service was top notch as our water was always topped up. I went for brekkie with the hog and chick and hubby did the BLT and our other two friends also went with lunch. \n\nSomehow I remembered that the hashbrowns were better than what I dined on today, there was a slight bitter/sour slant to them and I was a bit put off, perhaps too over buttered for my taste today, however thick cut slice bacon saved the day as usual. \n\nAll in all the company was priceless and we will likely stick to eating near our place as it is a trek.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Yes, I will admit that my family watches Triple D.  Now with that said my wife and I have been to a few of the joints showcased on that show.  As many of you that have started this journey like we have you find killer places and some okay places.  Matt's is a KILLER place.\n\nMy wife and I were recently in the Phoenix area for a part of our vacation and planned to stop in for breakfast at Matt's the first morning.  We got there ~8am on Saturday morning and only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Yes the place was small but being the two of us it was not a challenge.  There are about 9 tables total (assuming setup for 2) and 8 or so counter spots.\n\nThe food is awesome!!  It was so good we changed our plans and went back the next morning! \n\nHere is what we had:\n\nPork chop marinated with pesto and eggs with home fries, side of bacon and toast with their very tasty home made jelly.  The pork chop is to die for.  I am a big pork chop for breakfast fan and usually very disappointed.  Not at Matt's, it was tender and cooked perfectly.  My eggs were cooked exactly like I asked for and the bacon is like think slices of heaven!  I had to have bacon both mornings and I am not a breakfast bacon fan usually.  This bacon would make anything taste great!  My wife had the daily special which was chicken sausage, fresh spinach and fontina cheese scramble.  Once again cooked perfect, not greasy at all but with big flavor.  We both had home fries which were incredible.  Nice crust with some rosemary and caramelized onions.  Pretty close to perfect!\n\nThe next day my wife had the waffle, which she liked.  The fresh maple syrup was the real star of this dish.  She was kind enough to pass the bacon to me (I know twist my arm).  I had the breakfast special which was a sirloin steak, eggs and hash browns.  The steak was SUPER tender and cooked EXACTLY how I asked (you can tell I do not experience that often).  It was obviously a good cut of meat and had been seasoned very nicely.  The hash browns were very nice.  Crust on both sides and tender in the middle.  Exactly what you would hope for.  Lastly was their toast and home made jelly.  It was like butter!!!  Nothing like your store bought jelly.  I am not a jelly fan but ate all of it both mornings!!!\n\nAs for the service it was pretty good.  They were slammed on the first morning but were pleasant.  The family atmosphere really made the hustle and bustle not so bad.  The second time we went in they remembered us and took the time to talk for a few minutes and show their appreciation for us coming back so soon.  Very nice touch!\n\nOverall this now my favorite breakfast joint from Triple D.  Whenever I travel to Phoenix I will plan to stop in.  I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants breakfast cooked the way it should be!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	No freezer in the joint so when they run out of OJ they have to literally go and buy more oranges!  The food is fresh and homeade.  I haven't been to their newest location which I hear is much larger inside to accomodate the massive breakfast crowds.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Small place, but a great breakfast. The waffle was perfect and the service was prompt. We went during the week, and the wait was about 10 minutes.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Very disappointed... Nice clean place and very friendly staff, but the food just really isn't that good!  The coffee was weak but flavorful, the OJ was good (freshly squeezed), the wheat toast with preserves was good, the pancake was very plain, the home fries were bland and covered in grease, the pork chop was under seasoned/bland, and the eggs were good but greasy.  Not worth the wait in my opinion.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The service was great, everyone was very nice and friendly. Also great was the sourdough toast, jam, honey lemonade, and crispy peppery bacon. The hash browns were buttery and crispy on the outside and yummy and creamy on the inside. I didn't care for the salami scramble, the salami was different than any salami I have, but it was definitely plentiful.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	When here after seeing it on food network.  The country potatoes and steak omelet with a side of bacon is what I had along with their honey lemonade.  Food was great and service was pretty good.  Everyone was super friendly, it just gets so busy that the work crew can't attend to everyone all the time.  I would definitely go here again.  Probably one of the best breakfasts I've had!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Until I read the rant reviews about Matt's I never knew there could be so many people with cold coffee running through their veins.  Wow.\n\nSumming it down, it seems the #1 complaint is at Matt's (unlike Denny's) they have to wait in the hot Phoenix sun to get in or that the place is "small".  DUH!  If you go to a place that serves better-than-average food, and it is a small old historic place it's not going to be the same as squeezing your tubby stomach into a booth at Denny's and ordering an "out of your mind" $1.99 breakfast to make your butt even bigger.  In other words, if you like Denny's so much why did you go to Matt's?\n\nMake your choice ... pre-processed food from a mega-chain, or fresh food from local guy who works hard to serve locally grown/bought products and has gotten extremely popular because of it.  Small?  Are you kidding?  That's GOOD, not negative, how can you possibly rate a place bad because it is small?\n\nHate the Food Network?  Geez ... then don't go to a place that has been so highly rated.  Why subject your tender spoiled body to waiting in that "miserable" Phoenix sun?  People waiting in line means they know where to find great food.  BTW, my first few visits to Matt's were BEFORE Triple-D and it was and remains a place to go for people who have good taste.  And the complaint about having to go to the bathroom in the kitchen is pure BS - the clean bathroom is in the motel next door, not the kitchen.\n\nWe only have one Matt's in Phoenix and thank you heavens.  Is the food good?  Yes?  Is it fresh and uses the best local products?  Yes?  Is the service friendly and local?  Yes (if you're a tourist or Snow-Bird you just won't get this concept anyway).  Somebody believes the OJ is $2.50 for 2 ounces?  Really?  REALLY??  \n\nHere are a few personal observations:  I don't eat potatoes much, but I almost always finish Matt's home fries.  I am not a big bread eater, but I love Matt's fresh home-made bread.  Their eggs are local and bought by Matt every morning (he doesn't own a refrigerator or microwave at his restaurant).  The bacon on NOT what you will find at Denny's (a place you can walk right in to without having to spend 30 minutes of your precious self-consumed life standing in that horrid Phoenix sun). No, NO, I'm serious, there are actually tourists who reviewed Matt's and compared them negatively to DENNY'S!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhere Matt's really shines is not so much their excellent breakfasts, but the fact that they probably make one of the best Reuben Sandwiches in America.  Yes, better than Manhattan, better than that place where you chomp into a lot of fat and bread and pay twice as much for the privilege.  Not only is the sandwich great but the side of homemade macaroni salad is big enough to serve the entire restaurant.\n\nWant to avoid the 30 minute wait for breakfast?  Go to Matt's for lunch when the place is much less busy and get to know the people who work there and why their food is several cuts above most of what you will find in Phoenix.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I like the bright, small-diner atmosphere and the use of cage-free eggs, organic produce and grain-fed natural Iowa pork and Angus beef.  I found the rationale stated on the backs of the menus and on the website, "We believe that food prepared this way not only tastes better but is better for you" quite ironic considering the amount of butter and olive oil their food is fried in.  My stomach couldn't take it.  I guess if I go back for breakfast, I can always get the Frosted Flakes for $4.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Nice new location with the same small feel and long lines to get in. Awesome bacon! I generally order sausage with eggs but you have to get the bacon here. I have ordered the burger before and it is a very good size good quality burger. Don't missed the old location which is less than a block away from the new restaurant. DDD was there for a reason.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	When I was at Pizzeria Bianco, the second in line peeps mentioned that I try Matt's Big Breakfast. I had also saw the episode on Triple D with Guy Fieri and the dude raved that this was his fave. Now I had already put it on the "must go" list and then asked for recommendations. I was told to expect an hour wait, order the waffles or griddlecakes and the pork rib chop. Good info...\n\nIt was ambitious of us to want to wake up early to have Matt's, but we did eventually get there, even with the stoopid Android GPS getting us lost at First Ave and not First St. We had made a few passes around the block and saw the farmer's market diagonally from Matt's. I dropped off Kathy to put our names down, parked in the lot and headed over to the farmer's market. Now, you couldn't plan this any better, but the market is open Sat and Weds, so what better way to kill time, instead of sitting in heat? After about 40 mins, we headed back and got called immediately.\n\nWe got in and ordered waffles with a side of the griddlecakes, since Kathy couldn't decide. I went for the pesto crusted pork rib chop with home fries that were Yukon gold potatoes grilled with rosemary and onions and two eggs over easy. The batter used for both the waffles/griddlecakes were light and fluffy and when you factor in the homemade whipped butter and authentic Vermont maple syrup, the combination is Dyno-mite! My pork rib chop was tender and moist and the Yukon gold fries were absolutely perfect. The thick toast with a side of peach marmalade was delicious. I'm stoked they use locally grown produce, as that ensures that the food is always tip top. The super thick bacon that came with the waffles were just perfect balance of salt and savor. Simply bueno!\n\nI'm always in awe of the other reviewers who were expecting some Iron Chef to blow them away with spectacular gourmet food. To do the basic breakfast items and take them to another level should be spectacular in itself. I highly recommend Matt's Big Breakfast for simplistic elegance and for breakfast that truly did deserve Guy Fieri's adulation.\n\nHousekeeping items: Go Saturdays, so you can check out the Farmer's Market with all the free and tasty samples. That should keep you busy as your name floats to top of the wait list. The wait staff wants to turn over tables, so other Yelpers can get in and eat too. \n\nStay hungry my friends and happy eatings...
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This is the first breakfast place I tried when I moved from Indiana to Arizona in May 2010. It is fantastic! \n\nOK, let me get the "negatives" out of the way: \n\n1. Small Place, (possible) Long Waits \n- Most people are impatient, no matter how good the food. If you are one of those people and want to eat here; get here BEFORE the doors open. \n\n2. OK, can't think of any more. \n\nAll the Positives: \n\n1. Yes it is small, but it has a wonderful old-school diner feel. \n2. The wait staff is friendly and attentive. \n3. The food is worth the wait! \n\nOn my trip to Matt's I had: \n\n1. Honey Lemonade (not as sweet as you might fear - very tasty) \n2. The Hog and Chick \n(Two eggs and choice of off-the-bone ham, thick-cut bacon, or country sausage - I went with the bacon) \n\nThe eggs were perfect; I always ask for over medium and rarely does a place get the consistency right (Matt's did). \n\nThe thick-cut bacon was always cooked to my specification - not too crispy; I still like a little chew to it. \n\nSince I got there at/before they opened, I was in right away, got my food, enjoyed it, and was out in about 30 mins. \n\nA small place, with great service, great food, and a loyal following. I can see why!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Does anyone actually wait more than once for this?  We waited 1 hour; thankfully, it was a beautiful morning.  Once inside we had trouble sitting on the bar stools, they are so small and slippery.(We aren't large people)\n  I stood up to eat my breakfast.  My husband enjoyed his Iowa pork chop, but my ham and cheese omelet was generic.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Can't believe it took me so long to try this place! Heard about it from friends and of course saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and I had been wanting to try it forever but just never had the chance. I finally tried it with some friends and WOW was it good! I had the salami scramble which was DELICIOUS! Never though of putting salami in eggs but I knew I had to try it and it was really delicious...the eggs and salami combo was really tasty. Got that with hash browns and sourdough toast...I have to say, the hash browns were the BEST I've ever tasted. I have no idea what they do to them to make them so good but they were amazing! Very crunchy too which I love. The toast and coffee were quite good as well, and I can't wait to try the pancakes next time!! Best breakfast I've had in a long time!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Seriously, Matt's cooks up some of the best breakfast food I have ever had. I've been going here for three years or so, and I have never been disappointed. I've never waited much more than 30 minutes, but that's probably because I never go on weekends after 8:30 AM and never at lunch time on weekdays. \n\nTheir eggs benedict is hands down the best I have ever had. It's a special, so you have to be lucky to get it. Before I ever had their eggs benedict (the first was actually a sausage benedict with their AMAZING sausage), i had never really been a fan. But their benedict sparked such a deep love that whenever I've been in a restaurant that serves benedict, I always get it, but it never measures up. Their fresh hollandaise, perfectly poached egg, delicious ham and wonderful english muffin... just cannot be beat. And then you have their oh-so-buttery hash browns that I crave on a regular basis. I used to have a problem deciding between their also awesome homefries roasted perfectly with rosemary, but now I can't resist the hash browns. Also, their bacon is absolutely heavenly, and I'm not really a huge fan of bacon, so I always end up ordering a side of it. The omelets and pancakes are also always perfectly fluffy and delicious, and I've never found their portions to be remotely small. I always leave completely fat and happy. My only complaint that I can think of is that their delicious orange juice comes in an insanely small portion, but their delicious honey lemonade makes up for it.\n\nThis is always on my list of restaurants I absolutely have to go to when I'm home from college.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The food here is worth all of the negatives- the wait, the service, the atmosphere. Sometimes you just need that hearty breakfast to start your day, and Palatte just won't succeed.\n\nI recommend everything here. Seriously, everything. Especially the Daily Specials.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	If you are craving basic nothing special breakfast food save yourself the hour long wait outside in the 100 degree heat and go eat at Denny's or IHOP.  Trust me you'll pay half as much and leave feeling less icky.\n\nI seriously don't understand the draw of this place.  The whole restaurant seats maybe 20-30 people, so we ended up sitting outside in the heat for over an hour waiting for a table.  Other reviews claim much longer wait times.  When we finally got a table our waitress was friendly enough and got our drink orders pretty promptly.  When they brought us our food  was nothing special just eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns.  The quality was no better than what you might get at any typical breakfast joint.  Seriously Food Network I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  The waitress forgot to bring us our bread.  After two requests and our meal just about finished our bread was finally delivered to the table.  Unfortunately, my boyfriend's bread had a little something extra...a nice long hair.  Disgusting!!  \n\nNever again.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Yes you will have to wait. Is it worth it? YES. Today I visited with a friend of mine. I could smell the scent of bacon, coffee which fueled my appetite but I was craving a burger. You know a burger is good when no mayo, mustard, or ketchup are needed. Just the taste os a well cooked burger (side of kettle chips).  Expect a wait, most of the time. Come hungry. Waiting is outside (it is a very, very small building), but worth it. Next time, I will order the breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Buttery Buttery Buttery...YUMMY!\n\nAfter dealing with the WRONG way on 7th (thanks for nothing Yahoo! maps), we were now super duper hungry...and secretly, I need breakfast within 30 minutes of waking up. I knew there could be a weekend wait and with some toast in my belly I braved the hot noon sun. Located next to a sketchy hotel/residence space (hash browns AND heroin!), this small space is DAMN small. A nice walkway with cacti and rustic fence create a lil space, and dumps you into the counterspace/dining room. First impression-this place is WHITE-I mean, like the walls are white, the counter is, the seats are re-upholstered vintage chrome stools white, but the tables are a beautful blood orange formica-oh yeah, I like that...with lil' orange gerber daisies. Like so, cute.\n\nWe thought about sitting at the counter, but with a chance for shortie chairs, we went next to the window that actually gave a promising look of artsy downtown PHX-def. added to the experience instead of what I would consider a dreaded smooshed in one in the small room in the back (is that where bad people go to eat eggs?). After some confusion over why one would need water AND iced tea, I got to sample their coffee and orange juice. Man, I LOVED that orange juice-simply the best. And the coffee was good black, always a test of quality. The menu is small and due to the lack of veggies with the breakfast (does cheese count as a veggie?), I went with sweet instead of savoury. I got the belgian waffle (an option of fruit would have taken this to a whole 'nother level, btw) and WOW-but-ter-ry. I think made with real buttermilk too. With butter melting on top. Was the maple syrup made with butter too? Possible. I think maybe all of Matts Big Breakfast may be made of butter...mmmmm. It was so rich I really had to leave one lone piece on my plate. I could not eat it. Really. COULD NOT-immediate expulsion from the clean plate club. Totally ashamed of my inability for the MBB money shot.\n\nNice asides: \nThe taters are with caramelized onions and rosemary sprigs-HOLLA.\nI asked to have the bacon substituted with the afore-mentioned, and the waitress said that wasn't possible-but she did deduct buck and some change from the price of the waffle, which as a veggie I deeply appreciate-CLASSY\nParking lot and parking on street.\n\nBonus: Cute children will linger around your table and smile, much like nervous men at bars with bottles instead of beers, and not say much, making your experience alternate between unbearably cute and creepy.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Love this place. I went there for the first time this morning. It was outstanding. When we where told the wait was over an hour we debated not staying. I am so glad we did. Totally worth it. \n\nEverything was cooked perfect. The homemade bread with preserves was awesome. I got the hashbrowns which where great. So much butter which I know is bad for you but if you are coming here for breakfast I doubt health food is what you are looking for. My girlfriend got the home fries which where actually better. \n\nJust the best breakfast in town period. Go there and wait it out. So worth it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The wait was a little long but the waitress was able to take or ordered while we waited, as soon as we were seated our food arrived. I had the waffles with bacon.  The bacon was crisp and the waffles were like cake, so delicious.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I heard many people saying we should try Matt's Big Breakfast so we had to go.  This place is VERY small with very limited seating inside and no outside option when we were there.  We waited for about 45 minutes talking to people outside about how good it was.\n\nOnce seated, on the window bar stools, we were promptly greeted.  Service was good if not abrupt and to the point.  The portions were a good size, but there are bigger out there for sure.  \n\nOur food was good but nothing great as we had been hearing.  This is NOT worth the wait if you ask me, but I would go there as a neighborhood staple if no more than a 10 minute wait. \n\nFor my $ and time, I'm going to Farm House in Gilbert if I had a choice, now THAT PLACE is worth the wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The Place: \nAfter reading many of the hundreds of reviews talking about the size of Matt's, I was still surprised when I pulled up with my family and the restaurant was the building that looked like a small shed.  LOL.  Forget small, the place is micro.  It has a bit of an urban chic/diner-vibe, but there is nothing to the appearance that would make someone ooh and aah.  Our table was two tables for two, butted together with two chairs facing the window/wall, and the other two facing each other, an odd, but space saving layout.  We were in the first room where there is also a tall bar to sit and eat, however that bar is also part of the "list".\n\nThe Food:\nI ordered the Hog & Chick with scrambled eggs, bacon, wheat toast, and home fries.  The bacon was as good as most have commented, a little sweet, smokey, and peppery.  The wheat toast was thick-cut and super grainy and served with raspberry lavender jam, both super.  The eggs were fresh, but just scrambled eggs.  In my opinion the highlight of my dish was the home fries - these potatoes were cut into chunks and fried with fresh rosemary twigs and onions.  I thought I needed ketchup for them, not hardly.  My wife tried the pancakes and wasn't particularly impressed, nor was I when I tried a bite.  They were okay, just not amazing.  Since there is no kids menu (which is an oversight in my mind) my older daughter ordered the waffle.  It smelled great, and she polished it off before I could get a taste.  I thought it looked good - and she said it tasted great.  Nice touch is that both waffles and pancakes come with REAL & VERY HOT maple syrup.  My other monkey, er daughter, had the Hog & Chick as well, however she had the hashbrowns and country ham.  The ham was good, but salty like good ham should be.  The hashbrowns were REALLY soaked in oil/butter.  They were crispy on both sides, but whoa ... really soaked.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nWe got REALLY lucky in that we got there and were able to get seated within about 5 minutes.  This was around 8:30am on a Thursday, as soon as we were seated, the crowd showed up and there were at least 20 people milling around outside waiting to eat.  The parking stinks, micro lot behind the restaurant, and other than that it's metered parking.  $.60/hour is still cheap though.\n\nI enjoyed the food and the experience was a little to crazy for my family of four with two squirmy kids.  I'm not a hater, but I'm not going to tell you it's the best breakfast I've ever had either.  The prices were fair, but again with a family of four with two small kids we tend to appreciate a place with a kid menu.\n\nIf it was only adults and we weren't so wiggly it might have been a different story.  I'm not sure I'm headed back there any time soon with my little wiggle worms.  That being said, you should try it and see what you think.\n\n(big plus is that they took AMEX - one of the few small shops that do)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Yay! I'm a fan! I tried Matt's Griddlecakes and Salami Scramble. Also tried the freshly squeezed orange juice and sipped on their coffee. \n\nHere's what I liked -- the griddlecakes are 3 stacked pancakes with "mystery" ingredients. It seems like they infused the pancakes with butter and milk. They place sweet cream butter on top! Please make sure to share this plate! It's very sweet and I could only eat half! They also mention to give real maple syrup on the side, which is a nice touch. I'm just a tad skeptical though if it is real. \n\nI do like their hash browns and salami scramble. It's a little on the salty side, but it is tasty! The orange juice to my surprise did taste great! I would definitely recommend this place to a friend!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Blink and you might miss where Matt's Big Breakfast is located. But don't let the small size of this breakfast hot spot fool you, nor let the long wait deter you. Matt's had been right around the corner from me, and I had no idea until today what I had been missing out on. A group of friends and I all sprung for the daily special of scrambled eggs incorporated with hot links, white cheese, and peppers paired with delicious home fries. So while the wait, especially during a blustery summer day in Phoenix may make you want to stray, don't, and you will be in for a treat!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Finally made my way down to this place.  Was avoiding it because of the long wait everyone talks about but I had more time on my hands today so decided to give it a try.  Arrived around 12p on a Sunday and we were seated in about 45 min (party of 2- apparently, parties of 2 or 3 get seated the quickest).  Th wait wasn't so bad being that we found so shade and I had my phone to keep me occupied.  The hostess was very friendly.  The place is small.\n\nThe menu was a lot smaller than I expected.  For breakfast dishes, there were about 5-7 egg dish choices and a handful of other choices.  I opted for the griddlecakes and my husband ordered an omelette w/ cheddar, sausage and mushrooms.  He had coffee and I had the honey lemonade.  The lemonade was very refreshing, fresh squeezed and just the right sweetness.  As far as the food goes, it was good.  The sausage has a nice spice to it, the griddlecakes were light and fluffy, the strawberry jam and toast were yummy and the omelette was tasty.  My hubs ordered the hashbrowns with his dish and he prob should have gotten the home fries b/c they looked a lot better (based on the table next to us).\n\nI give it 3 stars b/c it's just good fresh food and, for the most part, cooked well (the hashbrowns were a litte more greasy than I prefer).  I don't know if I would go through the long wait for it in the future.  Coming from San Diego (Hash House, the Mission) and LA (The Griddle), it's missing something more unique to make it worth the wait.  I've waited 60-90 min for those places.  Def give it a try if you've never been.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Based on service, cuisine and originality alone I would back Matt up in a knife fight any day.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	No frills basic breakfast.  Hash browns were soggy and oily. Chop was cooked nearly perfect. Chop and chick, side of bacon, and glass of OJ came to $18 including tip, so it's a little pricy for a basic breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Pretty darn good! I hate waiting in line to get into restaurants, but Matt's is actually worth the wait. I would have given them 5 stars, but I have to give one star to the Farmer's Market a block away that made the wait fun and enjoyable. Support local farmers AND support your belly.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The single handed worst breakfast experience I've ever had. The only time I've ever waited over 50 minutes for a table before giving up. I came alone on a Saturday at 9am. I asked how long the wait would be for a party of one and the hostess(I guess you could call her that) stated that, "they don't quote times, but that it goes fast." They don't write down the time you arrive so either management doesn't care how long the patrons are waiting for a table or are to dumb to look into it. I find it rude, disrespectful, and disingenuous to patrons to not quote a time on one hand while saying it goes fast on the other. They must have known that patrons were waiting close to an hour for a seat and they are hoping that we would become "pot committed" and hang out for the table. \n    Maybe they are hoping that you will wait so long that you get so hungry that the food will taste better. I've eaten at Matt's Big Breakfast before and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars on food quality. They aren't spectacular just good. Sadly Phoenix is deeply lacking in good breakfast joints. \n    So starving after a 50 minute wait I decided to head home and stop at McDonalds (also a one star restaurant, but at least I won't wait 50 minutes to get to place my order). While en route I drove by LO LO'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES approx. 2 miles from Matt's big (slow) breakfast and noticed that it was fairly empty at 10am. I pulled in to Lo Lo's and was pleasantly surprised to find a hidden gem for breakfast. How about that the worst breakfast experience turns into one of the best. I was immediately sat at a table(there was enough space for 8 person parties. Coffee was promptly brought and it was perfect in every respect of the word. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and I was dumbfounded why I tried to go back to Matt's Big (slow) breakfast with so many other options available.\n    Two additional points I'd like to make: first, there was a bunch of people waiting for Matt's Big (slow) Breakfast but it wasn't a constant flow of additional people coming it was the same bunch of people waiting for 50+minutes; second, YOU'VE been warned.\n    If you want to try something different/unique/and worthwhile give LO LO's Chicken and Waffles a shot at breakfast. I don't mind waiting for a table at a desirable restaurant. What I mind is a restaurant that doesn't value it's patrons enough to respect their time and to allow their patrons to make conscious decision if they want to wait or not.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Best breakfast in Phoenix hands-down!\nLove, love, love the Chop and chick!  The pork chop is cooked perfectly.  First time ever I've had a pork chop cooked and seasoned perfectly that I didn't make myself :)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Seriously good stuff here.  Yes, the lines are long but that's not really their fault.  The food is great and people want to come here.\n\nThe waffle here is simply the best.  I've never had better, anywhere.  I've also had the burger, which was really, really, really good.  Next time I'll see if they can put a different cheese on it because I'm not a big fan of American cheese.  Regardless, everything here was delicious, regardless of the line.  If you're willing to wait, or maybe come at an off-hour, it's definitely worth the wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We went at about 9 on a Monday morning, and didn't have to wait in line at all.  I had the Hog & Chick with bacon, hash browns, and sourdough toast.  It was fantastic.  The hash browns were a little crunchier on the outside and softer on the inside than I would have preferred, but overall they were good.  The bacon was different, but in a good way.  It was very thick, not overly crispy, a little sweet, and peppery.  I'm not usually a fan of bacon, but really enjoyed theirs.  The toast was fantastic.\n\nPerfect for: when you want a typical breakfast done better
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	do not be fazed by the massive amount of people waiting outside.  just put your name down on the notepad and make yourself comfortable.  the wait on a Sunday morning was 1 hr, which really is not all that bad.  turnover rate is quite fast.  the breakfast was very good and worth the wait.  i had the pork chop and eggs.  the chop was nicely marinaded and cooked well.  the toast was thick cut, with the right amount of butter (i.e. not soaking wet), and came with good strawberry jam with chunks of strawberries.  amazingly, even though the food looked like greasy diner food, it did not taste greasy!  i think it was the butter that made the difference.  i ate every bite of my breakfast and did not feel overloaded.  service was quick and pleasant although i did have to ask twice for ketchup.  seating will be crowded, but you'll be comfortable enough to enjoy your breakfast.  overall, a very good use of my sunday morning.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What hasn't been said about Matt's???  It's great food and the folks that work there are as friendly as they can be.  Get there early or you'll wait.  Every time I bring the two year old with me the staff goes out their way to take care of this Daddy on a date with his daughter.  Hog and Chick is the staple and the hash brown taste like they've been cooked in a pound of butter.  Be still my beating heart... Eat any more and we'll see that.  The Missus had the pancakes and they were also great.  Fresh ingredients abound and you syrup isn't flavored corn syrup.  Real maple syrup!!!  A true Phoenix landmark and place to eat
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's Butter Burger is THE dish to have here! Matt starts his lunch menu @ 11am. The breakfast here is good don't get me wrong just skip breakfast & go 4 the butter burger. Also make sure u don't park on the empty dirt parking lots in front of & behind Matt's or you'll get a $120.00 ticket! Park on the paved streets/lots only & keep in mind parking is limited.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Many reviewers indicate that it's worth the wait, and I MUST wholeheartedly agree!\n\nKnowing there would probably be a wait on a Sunday morning, my co-workers and I hustled ourselves out of bed a little earlier than we otherwise would have, checked out of our hotel, called for the valet to bring our car, and drove to Matt's.\n\nI was frankly surprised at how very tiny the building was - I knew it was small, but WOW!  There didn't seem to be *too* many people waiting before us, so we put our names on the list.\n\nWe waited probably 45 minutes, and were very glad that it hadn't gotten truly HOT out yet.  Once inside, the place looks even smaller than it did from outside.  We were seated at the bar, which honestly looked a lot less cramped than some of the other tables with "large" parties (read: more than 2-3 people).  I think the entire place might seat 20 people?\n\nWe were immediately asked for our drink orders (coffee, orange juice and water), then our food orders.\n\nI should have paid more attention to what my co-workers ordered (I know Hayden and Sheri shared an order of pancakes and bacon, and maybe something else, while John also had pancakes and something else with hash browns), but seriously?  Once my Belgian Waffle arrived, there was little room for me to pay attention to anything else.  \n\nI can't say I consider myself a connossieur of waffles or anything like that, but I've truly never tried another waffle that even comes close to comparing to this one.  The consistency was absolute PERFECTION!  It was crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and the texture was hearty enough to hold up to the (real!) butter and (real maple!) syrup I subjected it to.\n\nOh, yeah, I also had the thick-cut bacon.  It was just a little too peppery and a little too done for my taste, but it was still quite good.  John declared the hash browns to be the best he'd ever had, and the pancakes got the same pronouncement from Hayden and Sheri.\n\nService was spot-on and cheerful.\n\nThere's just a couple things I would change about Matt's if I had the opportunity:\n\nA) Expand.  With the demand, they could easily seat and serve twice or even three times as many customers and still have a wait on weekends!\n\nB) Get a public restroom.  My very first desire upon leaving was to find a restroom!\n\nC) Relocate.  Seriously, Austin needs a place this good!!!  I know at least 4 people who would ensure good business forever after...
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The best hashbrowns I have ever had. Cripsy, buttery, not soggy or soaking in grease. Cooked well done, can't wait to go back. I went for brunch around 10:30-11am and the wait is not as bad as earlier in the morning.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	"How far is the drive from LA to Phoenix?" \n\nI recently caught myself contemplating this one morning in my home in LA. That is how good this place is! \n\nRecently, on a business trip, we went for a sort of brunch/lunch. My wife had already had breakfast there that morning and insisted we return. Myself, being a skeptic, lowered my expectations so I would not burst her bubble. After my first bite of their Reuben sandwich and their hash browns I began to bubble myself! In a good way of course! \n\nThe combination of the QUALITY ingredients and the simplicity of the items made everything we ate a joy. This is a trait I have seen through most of Europe and hopefully the trend is coming here. Quality and simplicity are king! \n\nNow the trick is to somehow get back to Phoenix. Foiled again, I knew there was a catch to this place!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I was first introduced to Matt's Big Breakfast when I was a resident of Flagstaff, AZ, where waiting for a good breakfast is an everyday part of life.  I know that some people in Phoenix will not be able to wait, since they have their Denny's and Waffle Houses in their neighborhood.\n\nWith that said, Matt's Big Breakfast is worth the wait.  Waiting is good for you.  And the wait is usually not that long.  And, while you are waiting, there is stuff to look and see and do!  The Downtown Public Market is adjacent to Matt's, the people at the Coronado Hotel are pretty cool after you give them a cigarette or "shfifty shents".  \n\nThe staff is always in a rush but as pleasant as cherubs.  The coffee smells delightful, and the honey lemonade is the bees knees  The food is the best part! I love the ingredients that Matt picks, which are local and organic when the product is convenient, affordable, or rockstar status.  All the eggs are from local cage free chickens.  All of the jams and jellies (which rotate on a daily basis) are from local businesses and they will probably help relieve any allergies you have (if you live in Phoenix).  When I was a young Big Breakfast eater, I enjoyed the Five Spot and worked my way up to the to the succulent egg and pork Chop and Chick before graduating to simply ordering the special, and trusting that Matt and his minions will take care of me.\n\nThe specials are the reason why I keep coming back, and why I bring my friends.  I have brought out of town poets, musicians, and artists to Matt's.  They all love the diner feel, the orange and simple menu, the nice and friendly staff, and of course - the BIG breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Really, Guy?  So I guess if it's featured by Fieri you have to go, and you have to love it, right?  This is coming from the guy who plans cross-country road trips to get my lips on some of the food I see Triple-D.  Sorry Matt's, you kind of fell short on this one.  The wait was way too long for breakfast, although I guess the place is famous now so it's to be expected.  \n\nInside, there were definitely more staff than diners, yet we seemed to be invisible.  We waited forever to get menus, drink and food orders, etc.  The staff were friendly enough and apologized once realizing how long we waited, but come on - it's breakfast, and there are all of what, 5 tables in the whole place?\n\nThe food was fantastic, no way to argue that.  Just a little over-priced for the experience that we didn't end up getting.  \n\nWould I go back again?  Yeah, if someone came cross-country on a Fieri food frenzy and demanded it.  Otherwise, I would stick to a little more down-to-earth kind of place, which I bet this once was.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Holy pancake orgasm, Batman!  \n\nThe richest. smoothest. buttery-est, fullest, fluffiest, tastiest cooked-to-perfection pancakes you'll ever eat. Those of us who haven't had the pleasure of dining at Matt's thought we knew a good pancake... WRONG!  Matt's is where it's at, 1/2 hr-1 hr wait and all (We were seated in 1/2hr Tuesday @ 10am).  \n\nThe restaurant is very busy, so one cannot expect the servers to build rapport with the customer.  Rather it's more important they keep my coffee and OJ full with a smile, which they did well.\n\nI had the ribeye, eggs and home fries, which was one of the specials of the day.  While my steak was cooked medium when I requested medium-rare, it was delicious, well cooked and seasoned to perfection.  \nEggs over easy done text-book as well, fresh, hot and you can't get any better.\n\nThe portions on most of the orders seemed small, so we had to order some sides which drove up the bill total.  The menu can be inexpensive if you just order one thing, but there are so many great things to try!.. like the fresh strawberry preserves!\n\nHands down this is best breakfast gem in Arizona and I can't wait until we can go back!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Don't go if you are in a hurry but definitely go if you're really hungry. I went on a Saturday morning and waited about 45 minutes. The servers were really friendly and not pushy even though you know they have a line of people waiting outside. I had the griddlecakes and my (very picky) friend had the salami scramble which he devoured. The food was really good, but I wasn't floored like I expected from what I've heard. I will definitely return though, it's a fun place to take people who don't venture to Phoenix much from the suburbs or are from out of town.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	After hearing so many positives about Matts Big Breakfast, I decided after retrieving my friend from the airport to go and get my breakfast on! Love at first sight , no!! But never judge a book by it's cover, right? Huh, maybe... Parking is minimal, and in that part of the city.. It can be dicey to find parking . The place is tiny.. Tinier & more cramped with dreadful decor... Much like Over Easy, in fact! There are a handful of basic breakfast selections.. With catchy names though.. I ordered the 'hog & chick' for example.. Only bc I wanted to have poached eggs.. That was     just the easiest way to get them& I passed my 'hog' on to my hungry hog\n\nloving friend... The eggs are free range &  were perfectly poached, score ! Finally some chef in the desert got my poach correct... I'm very picky on the poach... Not like it's a hard process, I know as I have the calphelon pan for poaching in my own loft! I loved my home fries.. Big nice wedges of potatoes.. Sidenote -- too many Rosemary stems.. For me and my built in retainer , it could become a toothy disaster ! And whoa with the onions... Yikes ! Great for flavor, but not unless your planning on being amongst the masses following breakfast! There were a ton of big slivers of white onion.. But once your past picking all the flavor adding things out,you have great home fries..my friend has the hashbrowns, she said they reminded her of OreIda with alot of grease...I've never been a fan of shredded potatoes seemingly devised to soak up oil from the pan , so I wouldn't test them... Loved the bread... Wow! Homemade jams too.. Yum! There was no fruit on the plate.. It's presented in a basic diner way.. I personally like some fruit when I go down the breakfast path.. Relatively inexpensive.. Coffee , nothing special & no options for espresso ... Thot I was going to have a small panic attack over that alone... One other disappointment... Restroom?? No.. It's next door in a divey looking motel with wooden shutters ... I'll wait & use the Starbucks restroom as I drive home disappointed and needing espresso fast.. I'm thinking I'm seriously picky with my breakfast/brunch & just unable to find a 4star option here.. Oh well, I fly for free... I'm goin back to Cali..
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	3.5 stars for Matt's. While you can tell that their dishes are made with care and they use quality ingredients (local, when possible), I feel that this place is a little overhyped. The menu is basically glorified Americana diner breakfasts and, while they do it well and with a charm and authenticity rarely found in Phoenix, it's a little boring. Would it hurt to offer some variations of pancakes and waffles?! The pancakes were good - fluffy with a touch of sweetness - but nothing to phone home about. The standout was their breakfast special of the day - a three egg scramble with white cheddar, hot links, and a pepper they described as in between a green chile and a jalapeno. Proably the best egg breakfast dish I've had in a while. As good as it was, though, I can't imagine waiting a half hour or more for it. Luckily we went on a weekday at a good time and had no wait, but I've heard people wait for hours for this food, and it's just not that spectacular. My other complaint is that, for a place with "Big Breakfast" in the name, the portions are no larger than what you'd get at Denny's or IHOP. I'm not a proponent of oversized portions at all - I believe it's wasteful and contributes greatly to our nation's obesity epidemic - but, come on, ya gotta live up to your name. Not only that, but some of the prices are a little steep. $2.50 for the tiniest glass of OJ you've ever seen. Service is great, the place is cute, and the food is good, but the media attention and national recognition on Food Network have overhyped Matt's from what it truly is - a friendly neighborhood spot to grab a good, fresh, hearty breakfast made with care.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I did not wait long to try this place after going to the farmers market. I have had way way better. The food was so so. My impression here is that folks who rave about this place have never had really good food with flavor. I actually find that a lot in Phoenix...PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW GOOD FOOD HERE!!!! Look at most of the bad reviews and see where most of the people are from. Yeah, not here with exception of myself but I am actually from Los Angeles and have had access all my live to some of the best food around. Matt's big breakfast is a big joke! I actually prefer to go to wildflower over this joint.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	OMG - eggs Benedict special was amazing!\nI usually try to eat somewhat well, sauce on the side, eat half, cancer causing sweetener.\nAll that went out the window when i walked in there this morning.\nLuckily there was a short wait and it was a great day out!\nPut your name on the list by the door. Don't come into the restaurant unless you know you should - it's too small!!\n\nThe staff is amazingly friendly and down to earth!\nWe were seated promptly when called, got coffee and oj (order the double oj, small is really just a taste!)\n\nHubby did the Hog and Chix - mmmm! Bacon looked amazing. Bread is thick cut and comes with fabulous strawberry rhubarb jelly. Mmmm!\nI did the Benedict and it was amazing - did i mention it was amazing?\nThe sauce, oh the sauce.\nThe ham\nThe home made english muffin - smothered in butter...  yes my arteries are clogging as i write this...  but wow!\nThe home fries with the caramelized onions.\nThe coffee with the organic raw sugar.\n\nAmazing!\n\nCute little location. Limited parking - but we walked so it didn't effect us much.\nShort menu, but super yummy!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	While visiting Phoenix for a family reunion: we saw this breakfast spot had more reviews than any other spot. It's bright, cozy& the staff is super dooper friendly. The bacon! Oh my bacon. I had a Blt w/pesto instead of mayo. The mixed berry honey lemonade was yummy! Annnd Chelsea, ridiculously sweet & full of charm. Awesome service! So awesome, that I left my new sunglasses at the table and she came chasing us out to give them to me. \n\nIt's only 4 stars because I wish their menu was a tad more extensive.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Best...hashed...browns...ever.  (and yes, it's hashED browns, folks.)  I have tried a new brunch place almost on a weekly basis since I moved here in August, and MBB wins the hashed browns contest hands down.  They're so perfectly and proportionately crispy and soft.  DELISH!  Do try!  \n\nI ordered the hog and chick kind of out of necessity since there wasn't a great variety of choices on the menu, but in the end, it didn't matter cuz it was delicious.  I think the thing about MBB is that everything on the small menu is probably awesome, which is why they can afford to keep the menu small.  A nice touch was that they carried the Sunday newspaper, which was perfect since we forgot ours that particular weekend, and that helped to pass the waiting time for our food (which was not bad at all.  maybe 15 minutes.).  \n\nFor all you coffee lovers, the java here is pretty good as well.  In fact, the waitress told us that the owners of MBB just recently opened up a coffee shop somewhere locally, so I'll have to find out where and go.  I just hope I don't have to wait as long as I did to get into MBB to get some coffee.  Truthfully, it wasn't so bad waiting.  I think we only waited about a half hour.  The only downside to MBB is the small space!  You'd think they would want to expand a little, but mayhaps this is part of the allure for us MBB fans.  No pain, no gain. \n\nSidenote: Parking is not the BEST, but if you go early, you should be able to find a spot just fine.  ALSO, note that they do NOT split checks.  Good to know beforehand.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	if you don't like bacon, i would skip matt's, but if you like bacon, you should go every day. there is no bacon like the bacon at matt's. i have a friend who rants about this at least once a week. i'm certain this is the only meat product this vegetarian misses.\n\ni haven't really tried a lot of things on the menu. i'm a big fan of the specials and the 5 spot.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Why oh why must you be so tiny and have such good food, Matt's? It's some of the best breakfast I've ever had but it's still not worth waiting an hour. One time I woke up randomly at 6:30 on Sunday and went over there just in time not to wait for a ridiculous amount of time. That was nice. It almost motivates me to wake up early more often. Everything I've tried I've loved, including the waffle, pancakes, omelets and hashbrowns.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The menu is pretty lameski if you don't go in for a lot of meat.  Here's my problem with Matt's: if you order the cheese omelet and have their paltry selection of veggies added to it, you're paying more than you would for a meat omelet.  That's pretty stupid; meat costs more than vegetables, and is a bigger deal to store and prep.  How hard is it to offer a reasonable vegetarian option?  \n\nI've eaten there twice for breakfast and lunch, and quality each time was middling.  The hashbrowns were not good, really slimy and squishy on the inside.  \n\nNot worth the wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	It's everything and then some.  I only give it four stars because of how packed it is, and it can be kind of claustrophobic at times.  Other than that, I will wait all day in that line outside just to eat here!  So super yummy!  Definately a must try!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matts feels like home. The tables remind me of snack time in Grandma's kitchen, the salt and pepper shakers remind me of the ones that sat on my neighbor's counter in her collections.... even the slightly wobbly leg of the chair reminds me of my college apartment furnished with family castaways and thrift shop treasures. \n\nREAL food comes from a place that feels so much like home... by real, i mean... real eggs, real butter, real sausage.... \n\nFood at Matt's is pure and innocent... Pancakes with butter. Eggs with potatoes and bacon. Classic. \n\nyum.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Solid. Just had a trip to Phoenix to pick up a Diamondbacks game and tried Matt's Big Breakfast, well, for breakfast. I read the reviews for this place and decided to choose it based on the high rating.\n\nHad eggs, bacon, toast and the OJ. It was easily one of the best breakfasts I've had. When I visit again, I'll go back for sure and highly recommend it to anyone looking for breakfast.\n\nThe price was about right for the organic and natural foods they offer. It's probably a little more than most tiny breakfasts stops, but knowing the food served was chosen from natural food markets, the price was spot on for the quality of food.\n\nThere was a wait because the restaurant was tiny, but well worth the wait. Trust me, definitely swing by this breakfast diner. You'll be glad you did!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I just went to Phoenix for the first time this past week, and one of the must stop places on my list was this restaurant: Matt's Big Breakfast. This place has been featured on Dinners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network. On the third day of our trip, my husband and I went here, despite warnings from my cousin that the wait could take hours. Fortunately for us, we only waited twenty minutes. Upon entering this tiny retro diner, I ordered the special, an egg scramble with thick bacon, fontina cheese, and baby spinach in it. This was accompanied by hash browns, homemade bread and homemade jam. I was very pleased with my choice of meals, it was awesome!! My husband ordered the Hog and Chick. This is a meal that comes with two eggs any style, ham, fresh bread and jam, as well as a choice of hash browns or potatoes. My husband said the ham was incredibly delicious. I tried the potatoes with fresh rosemary and liked those even more than my hash browns. Both of our meals were around $8.00 each. There were not too expensive and they kept us full all day.\nDespite working in tight quarters, the waiters and waitresses were friendly and helpful.\nBecause our overall experience was so good, my husband and I returned here the morning we left for the airport. This time we both had the hog and chick. It was just as good as what I ordered previously. I highly recommend this sweet little joint in the heart of the southwest!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Oh, this place was worth the wait. My friends and I got there at 10:30AM and the wait was about 45min. Thankfully there was a farmers market across the street to keep me busy. \n\nMatt's was very small and there were no bathrooms inside of building. Strange floor plan. I ordered a Cheese Omelet with peppers and ham, coffee, and OJ. The coffee was heavenly...it was what I've been looking for all morning. The OJ was surprisingly tiny...the glass was as tall my fingers, but it was very fresh. The omelet came with a side of home fries or hash browns and bread. I HIGHLY recommend the home fries, which is chopped potatoes cooked with onions and rosemary. I got the wheat bread which was delicious. This is not your typical plain/thin wheat toast!  The omelet was huge and so were the ingredients. The peppers which I thought was be sprinkled in like most places was actually a whole sauteed pepper. The ham was smokey and thick. The serving was pretty good for a $10 breakfast. \n\nOverall, I think Matt's is superior to other popular breakfast joint such as the Breakfast Club or Orange Table. It was worth the wait, but I'll definitely be more strategic regarding the timing the next time around.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	While waiting to be seated I was acosted by an agressive panhandler :(  That being said we had coffee while we waited. On to the food...everyone in our party thought it was great...had the Hog & Chick myself.  The menu prices have gone up from what I saw on-line though...need to update their website!  Ernie (Matt's wife) helped us and was very nice. Overall was worth the wait...about 30 minutes on a Saturday morning.  There is a Farmer's Market across the street that you can check out while waiting :)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	If you like breakfast and everything it stands for, you've got to come to Matt's.  The reviews on Yelp sent me here, and I'm so glad they did.  The food is delicious, and buttery, and fatty.  But if you know in advance what you're getting in to, there's no room for complaints.  The food isn't healthy to put it mildly, but it's delicious. And it's perfect if you're hungover.  Seriously.  Go have breakfast here, take a nap when you get home and you'll be good to go.  \n\nBe advised that there is quite a wait on the weekends.  I had to wait around 35 minutes the time I went, but after reading all the reviews, I knew what to expect, so I didn't mind it. Good food usually means a considerable wait, so just suck it up and go anyways.  Once you try the food, you'll forget you had to sit outside for 40 minutes.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The place is so cute and unique. It is always crowded. I crave for their harshbrown. I think theirs is the best I ever tasted! It is crunchy and yummy. My husband loves their pork chop. I recommend to come early because they are usually packed with local people
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I have been hearing rave reviews about this place from all my co-workers, so I decided to give it a go.\n\nI called to place an order and the girl accidentally hung up on me. I don't know why that bothers me so much, maybe it's just because you should know how to operate your phone?\n\nWhen I went to pick up my order the place is busy, as always which is a great thing. It's like going to a Mexican restaurant and seeing Mexicans, it just means the food is good. \n\nI got the omelet with onions and ham, with hash browns and wheat toast. The top half of the hash browns were on point, crisp and tasty. The bottom half . . . soggy and soaked in grease. GROSS. \n\nThe omelet was huge! If you are looking for a lot of food this is the place to go, though if you are looking for taste I would skip the omelet. The only thing that didn't taste like cardboard was the ham. Thank God for the ham. \n\nThe wheat toast was ok, though the spread they include has chunks of fruit in it and is amazing.\n\nDon't order the OJ to go. You get about 3oz. of it in a plastic sippy cup. I don't know if they thought I was heading to the airport? \n\nAnyway, if you want a huge obese enticing portion go here you will get it. If you are looking for a non soggy breakfast I would keep looking.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	THE LINE IS HELLA LONG!!! so is the wait!! other than that I thought it was good..... Oh yah phoenix is hot.... and you will be standing in line outside!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	When I used to live in Phoenix I would be here a majority of my mornings! The Staff is so friendly and the food is high quality. I always stick with the classic bacon and eggs with some coffee, but I've had friends get the sausauge and steak which I tasted to make sure it wasn't poison...and I haven't tried anything that wasn't good! Part of what makes this place so good is the atmosphere. A tiny, trailer-esque diner? Sign me up! If there is a wait they usually have some water or lemonade to sip on while you wait....but the table turnover isn't too long, so it's nothing to complain about.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	While my friend Austin was here in town, he had wanted to eat at Matt's big breakfast after hearing about it on a travel channel show.  So, we wandered downtown and tried this place for breakfast.\n\nWhen approaching the restaurant, we noticed that parking was limited.  Mostly sidestreet metered parking.  We found an open meter, and went inside.\n\nThe place is really cute from the outside, and crazy small on the inside.  Its more of a simple decor, with orange table tops, and white walls.  We had a small wait, and put our name on the list.\n\nEventually, we sat at the bar after waiting about 15 minutes in the sun. I ordered a cheese omelette, and Austin ordered a cheeseburger.  Both our food came out, and it was tasty!  Service was quick, and we were in and out of there in less then an hour.\n\nO, and a word of advice.  The bathroom here is located in the middle of the kitchen!  I had "to go" while we were waiting, and I was surprised at the whole thing.  the bathroom is teeny tiny, and you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it.  Plus, its located immediately next to the grill!  If you can help it, either "hold it" or go before!  Fair warning for bathroom users!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	You know those mornings when you don't want to wake up? When you just want to lay there and rot?  Well, next time you feel that way and roll yourself out of bed, reward yourself with breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast!  YUMMMMMY.  It's all you need sometimes.   It's like homemade breakfast served to you in a cheery atmosphere, even a fresh little flower on your table.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Local owned, Local Grown this place is all the hype and more.  We ride our cruisers here for breakfast and even before we get in for work.  Why? This place has a warm feel to it and the food is AWESOME!  They have daily egg specials that are remarkable.  The Honey Lemonade is fresh and like no other in town.  It gets busy so get in early and put your name in the notepad at the door.  I would not recommend for large parties, because they are very small. Steak and Eggs every Sunday.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Do I really want to add to the love-fest? Yes I do.\n\nI've been here twice, and gotten in once (the wait got me the other visit). But now that I've made it inside, I can tell you that the wait is well worth it.\n\nM had it as simple as you can get: A single egg, scrambled. And it was light, fluffy and perfect.\n\nI had the Honey Lemonade and wish I could have it every day. \n\nI also had the waffle & Bacon, both were amazing. The thick cut peppery bacon is soo good. I don't eat a lot of pork; so for me to love bacon, it's a big deal.  The waffle is the best I've ever had. the exterior is perfectly golden brown, and the inside is like eating a cloud. A tasty tasty cloud.\n\nWait it out, it's worth it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I've been coming here for a long time, and there's been no dip.  Kudos to Matt and Erenia for holding true to the idea of making rad, no-frills breakfast food like they do back on the farm.  I don't eat here as often as I'd like, because the lines are impossible and I don't have the time to devote to an hour wait for Saturday or Sunday breakfast, but if the night before was long and I end up sleeping in, I have no shame about grabbing some breakfast at 1:30, and the lines are usually gone by then.  I will miss this place dearly.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I've been to Matt's Big Breakfast twice. I was not impressed by the long wait or the atmosphere. It  was small and dingy. The bathroom in the dive hotel next door was really disgusting.\n\nI did enjoy the food though. The first time I got an *egg white and vegetable omelet*, which was ok. It was fresh, which was good. The real stand out for me was the *toast*, they said they said it was local and the bakery sold at the farmers market around the corner. It was really delicious. I also enjoyed the *hashbrowns*, they were greasy but yummy. They used a spice that I couldn't discern. I think it was a little bit of nutmeg. It really popped. \n\nThe second time we went, I got the *egg salad sandwich*. It was well balanced. Same good bread. I got a side of hashbrowns, because I enjoyed them the first time. \n\nMy husband wasn't impressed at all. He thought his omelet was average and didn't really care for the atmosphere.\n\nBecause of the cost, and atmosphere, I don't think we will be returning anytime soon.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	It's worth the wait just for the orange juice - but the food is good too.\n\nThe boys went camping, so my daughter and I woke up early and headed downtown for the farmer's market and some breakfast. We stopped at Matt's long enough to put our name on the list and then ventured across the street to meander through all the local wares. We took our time and when we came back, we met and visited a couple of moms who had brought their daughters all the way from Calgary to try this place. (wow)\n\nHere's what we figured out about the wait: it's about 30-40 minutes per page of names ahead of you... (ish) Two pages of names ahead of us when we signed in = 1 hour 10 minutes total wait on the day we went.\n\nOnce inside, I loved the quaintness of the place ( and our service was superb. It's also obvious that they recognize people who have been in before and sometimes even know their names.\n\nBeing somewhat indecisive, we ordered the cheese omelet and the belgian waffle and shared. The omelet had just the right amount of cheese, making it a perfect accompaniment to the oh-my-gosh! fabulous wheat toast with locally made strawberry preserves. The hashbrowns were nothing to get excited about, but in the nirvana of the previously mentioned last bite, who cares?!?\n\nBut wait. Then I tried the waffle.\n\nOne of my best friends and I make waffles all the time - and have been making them for years. She's know for hers. I'm really sorry, dear friend, but Matt's has you beat. Their belgian is the ultimate experience of amazingness with just the right combination of being fluffy without being soggy. Add the 100% maple syrup and I'm good... so very very good. There's no need for the sweet cream butter - but it's there if you want it.\n\nIf they could pick the perfect orange at the moment of ultimate ripeness and squeeze it into a glass, you might be able to imagine the essence of every sip of the juice we drank. Just for kicks, we ordered the honey lemonade. Not really a breakfast beverage, but a must have for when we go back for lunch.\n\nGo knowing that you will wait and that it will be worth every minute. Definitely looking forward to going back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Being in the Navy, I've faced two-hour lines for some of the worst meals our galley slaves can conjure up, since the other option was "starve", and walked away hungry. Back home in Phoenix, though, I'll happily pace back and forth for two hours outside Matt's Big Breakfast because I know in the end it'll be worth the wait.\n\nBreakfast on a fall morning is a particular treat due to the presence of seasonal apple cider, which is phenomenal. Same with the blackberry preserves served with your side of toast. On my first visit, I ordered the day's special, an omelet stuffed with spinach and mushrooms, though couldn't help snitching from my mom's plate--she'd ordered the Chop and Chick, eggs served with a perfectly browned pork chop. The hash browns--my god. Studded with deposits of melted cheese that oozed out with every poke of my fork. Amazing.\n\nI've only been once for lunch, but I can say without hyperbole that the Big Butter Burger is the best cheeseburger I've ever had. Cooked in rich creamery butter that calls to mind a particular episode of the Simpsons. BEST CORONARY EVER. I couldn't even complain about the presence of chips as opposed to french fries.\n\nI really don't get the reviews dismissing Matt's as "meh", I'd love to know what heavenly manna these people consume the rest of the time
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Pretty good stuff, Though I waited near 30 minutes for a two top :)  The food was good, the hasbrowns , cooked in REAL butter were nice and crispy, the griddle cakes muy deliciouso!  I don't recomend the bacon, as it was a bit undercooked, but do try the honey lemonade! WOWZA!  I am considering going back when it's not so busy.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	You gotta love Matts Big Breakfast...a simple menu with the freshest ingredients, good service, and a cozy down home setting that makes you feel like you're eating in Grandma's kitchen. We got lucky on our last visit b/c it was later in the day and drizzling outside, so there was no wait at all and we got right in. I don't think I would try to go here during peak hours on a Saturday or Sunday morning, unless you like waiting a while to get seated. \n\nWe ordered the Salami Scramble (good) and the Waffle (great), along with a side of bacon. Their bacon is definitely one of the best in all of Phoenix, that's for sure. It's flavorful and juicy and crisp all at the same time. \n\nI don't think I would change a thing about this place, except for the sketchy location that it is in. It's kind of artsy fartsy and trendy on the one hand, but then on the other hand there are about 5 crack dens surrounding it. Let's just say I wouldn't want to be there alone at night.....hence why it is a breakfast place I guess. We actually experienced some of the shadiness first hand when we went to the hotel next door to go pee after our meal (no bathroom in the place). There was a torn up hooker in her 50's arguing with the lady at the check in desk about money with some guy who was missing all of his front teeth. There was obviously something illegal about to do down in one of the rooms, so we peed as quickly and quietly as we could and left the scene before we could get shot. Even so, getting shot is definitely worth the risk for some of their delicious food!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	By far THE BEST place to go for breakfast when you're in Phoenix.  Now stop reading, get off the Internet and get to Matt's right now.  The line will be long.  Enough said...
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	For some reason, we hit Phoenix on the first rainy day since October but that did not deter us from checking out Matt's Big Breakfast based on all the Yelp raves.  We had to wait outside for about 10-15 minutes in the rain, but finally got two seats at the bar.  When people describe this place as tiny, think 8 small tables and 6 bar stools tiny.  Do not try with groups...it will not work.\n\nThe waitress behind the counter was a riot telling people to "Smile, it's Christmas!"  She definitely kept the spirits up.  Our service was great, but we were at the counter where coffee was readily available.  First impression was that the coffee was great.  It is local, fresh and delicious.  My husband's waffle was really good but I won with the cheese omelette with mushrooms, onion and bacon.  It was full of gooey cheese and my husband helped me polish it off.  The hashbrowns were good, but a little greasy and the sourdough was perfect.  \n\nBottom line - it is worth the trek downtown if you are on vacation or do not live downtown.  Good simple breakfast with plenty of butter for you arteries to soak up.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I journeyed off after on my quest to find a good breakfast spot. Decided to drive to Phx and give Matt's a try. \n\nParking isn't easy. My super hero foresight made me move my car just in the nick of time! Sorry for the truck that got the ticket..\nAnyhow not a big selection to choose from. I decided to have two eggs over easy, off the bone ham(extra$), hash browns, wheat bread, and a\nCoffee..coffee was okay just coffee...not that I was expecting more..plate came up right away. Looked good. Ham was great! Would make a great sandwich with cheese. Eggs were eggs..Hash browns were good but I have a better idea...they were crunchy on outside and oily in the middle, it's bot bad just missing something...\nI would NOT stand in a ridiculous line for this place....
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	While I have raved about this place in the past, I wanted to once again extol the virtues and, more importantly, the family feel of this place. Ernie lights up the room with her smile. Once that happens, the coffee is served, and the service begins then the rest of the breakfast is just a wonderful continuation. Peg and I went for my birthday (actually, we try to extend family occasions so that we can visit the family of chefs with whom we have grown since we moved here in '97). The OJ was fresh, the specials are always superb, and there is a continuity in the kitchen that virtually assures that the quality will be stellar.  We can't wait for the new addition this month, and Peg and I always will support Matt, Ernie, and of course Christopher!  Dr. B
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	i dont think they care that they are so rude. the worst service i have ever had. i was amazed that they would treat their customers like that.\n\n i will not spend any money there
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Finally made it to Matt's for breakfast.  I had to check out the hype and see if it is what everyone says it is!  I took my nieces with me and I wasn't sure if it was very kid friendly...let's say I wouldn't bring young ones there just because it is so small and there is no room to run around.  But since my gals are 10 and 11 there was no problem accommodating them.  They split the delicious belgian waffle.  Let me tell you this is the tastiest I have ever tried!!  Real maple syrup is the key and they serve the best.  All piping hot and fresh off the griddle (my mouth waters just thinking of it).  I ordered the egg sandwich with no bacon, so it was a fried egg with american cheese and sauteed onions.  Not the healthiest option but I really enjoyed it.  I am not sure what kind of bread it was on but it was soft and fantastic.  The fresh squeezed OJ is like eating a ripe orange and the coffee was very well made.  All in all I can see why people are willing to wait for a long time to eat here.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ok, but not worth a significant wait.  The food is good, but anyone from the Midwest (like me) will probably find it to be similar to the average diner back home.\n\nI cannot figure out what the hype is for this place, other than perhaps the fact that this place stands out in a city that really doesn't have too much else to offer.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	It's everything the more flattering reviews say and more - including the wait outdoors. Mine was during a rare Arizona downpour, but even so, it was well worth it.  I waited about half an hour, sharing an umbrella with strangers.  When it was time to be seated, I was asked "are you ready, honey?" by a woman who might have been half my age, if that.  Even though the place was cramped and extremely busy, all of the staff were friendly and accommodating.  Not long after being seated, I was poured the first of what turned out to be four cups of delicious, freshly-ground coffee, at which time my order was also taken.  I had the special - 3 scrambled eggs with locally-raised ham, roasted red peppers, and provolone cheese.  It arrived promptly, and was savored thoroughly.  I'm leaving Phoenix in less than 48 hours, but I'm definitely planning a return visit.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What can I say about Matt's?!  I feel very lucky that a friend stumbled upon this place and shared it with me in the early years.  Well worth the wait and one of the best not so hidden gems in town.  There is only one thing keeping me from 5 stars.  Tabasco... really?  In my humble opinion, a breakfast restaurant with no Cholula or Tapatio is missing the essentials.  Tabasco is bush league and Matt ... that is one thing you are not.  Your wife is hispanic, right??  C'mon brother - ditch the tabasco and get the real stuff.  Even your cooks keep a stash of the good stuff.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I had an excellent meal here.  There were two of us and we arrived at about 7:30am on a Saturday.  We waited only 25 minutes.  We could have been seated at the counter sooner but decided to wait for a table.  The service was EXCELLENT.  For the type of  food you get here it did take longer than expected to be brought to our table though.  My omlette was cooked perfectly, the wheat toast was outstanding.  I was expecting traditional home fries but was surprised when they brought me Yukon Gold potatoes cut up and lightly browned with olive oil and rosemary.  The bacon was also cooked just right.  I also tried a couple of bites of their waffle which was good and I will most likely order that next time.  While it is a small place, you do not feel to cramped inside nor is it too loud to have a conversation across the table.   Portions are a good size and for both of us the bill was $20.00.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	First come, first serve so put your name down quick on that notepad...\nSuper friendly staff with super friendly comfort food.  \n\nDon't go with a big party! The three of us ordered grass fed steak and eggs, the pork chop and egg, the bacon and home fries... all were delicious!  The wheat bread came with their home made strawberry preserves.  \n\nGreat for an american breakfast spot!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My husband and I made it to the Farmer's Market early on a Saturday, which is quite a feat, so we decided to reward ourselves with breakfast across the street.  We'd heard great things about Matt's and I always see a crowd of people waiting outside.   He waited for our table while I shopped across the way at the farmer's market.  While he was waiting he went inside and asked for a cup of coffee.  He was told that they only sell coffee with to-go orders, so he asked for a coffee "to go".  He was turned down, so he walked across the street to the farmer's market and bought some coffee from a stand.  When our table was ready, they made him stand outside to finish his coffee because they have a strict "no outside food or drink" rule.  Pretty lame.  As far as the food, I had an omelet with spinach, mushrooms, and fontina cheese.  My husband had an omelet with hard salami.  While the food was good, it wasn't anything I couldn't have made at home.  The star of the meal was the locally made fresh strawberry preserves, but nobody told us that was coming and it didn't go too well with my husband's sourdough toast.  A heads up would have been nice.\n\nI think part of the allure of this place is the fact that there is almost always a crowd of people waiting outside.   There's very little chance I'll ever join them.  I'll stick to the breakfast gyros and free samples across the way at the farmer's market.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The first time I came here (their old location) I sat outside and waited for an hour and a half in the pouring rain. I had biked over, so I literally had nowhere indoors to sit and wait.\n\nAlthough I was hangry (adjective: angry from hunger), soaking wet and slightly impatient (this was back before they offered wait times), it was worth it.\n\nMatt's hash browns are perfectly crisp and golden. The eggs are rich and delicious, unlike the ones you find in chain grocery stores. The coffee (from a local roaster) is clean, fresh and bright. Their 5 Spot sandwich is a perfect sampling of all their delicious breakfast offerings, and the simple Hog n Chick is a fresh, local take on a classic egg and ham breakfast.\n\nI would recommend Matt's Big Breakfast to absolutely everyone.\n\nTip: If you don't want to wait for half an hour to 45 minutes, come between 7:45 and 8:15 nearly any morning of the week. The wait will be ~5 minutes, and you'll be leaving just as people begin to pile up!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I love places like this.  Had the hog and chick: eggs over easy, thick cut bacon (you always know a good spot if their bacon is legit), hash browns and homemade sourdough toast. Totally solid and cheap.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place lives up to it's hype. I had the waffles w/ thick cut bacon and hash browns, the flavors discovered my lost taste buds. The bacon has this special seasoning that goes nicely on it. One of the best hash browns I ever had. Long wait but worth it, the waiters are average they all work together which they try very hard to speed things up. 4.5.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My husband and I were visting Phoenix this past week. We looked on Yelp for a recommendation for a great breakfast place that wasn't far from our hotel downtown. \n\nBoy were we happy we found Matts! It was Thursday morning and the wait was only about 10 minutes. The restaurant is small and lively. The service was fast and friendly. And the food was FANTASTIC!\n\n I got the H & C - with delicious thick cut peppered bacon and fluffy scrambled eggs. The hashbrowns were delicous and the thick slices of sourdough toast with raspberry preserves completed the meal. The coffee was also very good. My husband had the salami scramble and thought it was very tasty as well. \n\nMatt's was one of the highlights of our week!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I thought the food was really good here. I went just like everyone else because of Diners, Drive-in's and Dives and some other local input. I can't even tell you how long we waited. It was unbelievable. The quality was good and the price was great. I would have given it 4 stars if we didn't wait outside for at least 2 hours. The place only holds like 5 tables so the service better be good. We have not been back because it's hard to justify that length of time waiting to eat.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's was absolutely fantastic. Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant.\n\nI had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll. \n\nBy default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.\n\nThe girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.\n\nI can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back. Probably near 2 o'clock again, to avoid the wait!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	So, it was 7:22 a.m. on the first Saturday of 2008 when we walked into Matt's Big Breakfast.  The place was maybe half full when we were taken to a table for two with a seat on the side.  A friendly waiter came by for drink orders; I went with apple juice but was later informed they were out.  The whole order went a little something like this, 2 coffees, 1 milk, 1 waffle, 1 cakes, and 1 special of ham eggs green chili and cheese scramble.  I hear the coffee was drinkable.  The waffle and pancakes had somewhat of a buckwheat taste but not sure if that is what they actually were.  I am a huge fan of Belgium waffles and found myself terribly disappointed.  I see a Belgium waffle as having a slight crisp of an edge and a soft center.  This waffle was very soft with no crisp and almost like a moist sponge.  The special was not the best and the pancakes seemed pretty heavy.  The home fries seemed like they were cooked in bacon grease and maybe sat there too long.  I did like the small quaint feel of the restaurant.  All of the staff was very friendly and worked together.  People of all styles came for breakfast, there were regulars, people in a hurry for the airport, couples, families, singles, people of all kinds.  They all were all asked, "How is the food?"  They all seemed to enjoy.  At the places prime they could probably seat 24 people, give or take.  I will probably not be one of them, but I am glad I was one once.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	After waiting outside in the rain for over an hour to get in, we finally got one of the only ten tables (if even that) in this place.  \n\nI do have to say that everything was fresh and everything tasted great... But... it's breakfast.  I know that big chains can somehow screw it up, but for the most part, it's not that difficult to pull off. \n\nThis is one of the better places I've had breakfast... Maybe it was the hype, maybe the wait in the cold rain, or maybe it was just the food.  \n\nWas it worth waiting in the rain for an hour?  No.  Was it worth waiting an hour without the rain?  No.  Was it some tasty breakfast?  Yes.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Just as everyone says, the food is awesome! BUT...if it's served with an attitude, damn it drags the experience down. I was totally disappointed in the place. Maybe a too go order would be good for you? Food is still good enough to fetch four stars.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Overpriced. Bland. If this is what Phoenicians rave about, no wonder they're so unhappy...
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	OVERRATED.\n\nI know it was reviewed on Food network channel as top 10 something or another in the nation.  Did their quality go down since they know that people will seek it out irregardless of the review?\n\nLocation- in down town Phoenix- but in a crappy part that doesn't look safe at night.  Dirt lot in back is not an option to park because of city ordinances or safety issues.\n\nWait time- for those reviewers who waited over 1hour in the hot desert sun- i don't know what to say. There is little to no shade, it's hot, you lean on wooden fences... it's a strange system where you sign your name to be called. However, if you sign in, and say you want to go do something else instead of wait an hour in the hot sun, they will cross you off the list if you aren't there for roll call. Some people behind us, just waited a bit then walked in and sat at the bar (where they were seating other people).  And they say they don't play favorites?  Please....  If you can't stand to wait, you can  order take out and get your food before all the other people waiting.  Do they let anyone know? NO. Do they care that people waiting over 1 hour have to wait another hour for food so To-Go people can get their food? NO...\n\nFood- maybe the food tastes better because your out in the hot sun,dehydrating, standing, waiting... because the food didn't look like anything special and didn't taste special either.  Just run of the mill breakfast food.  Does it take 45min to make waffles and toast?  We told them we had a flight to catch, and our food took a crazy amount of time to make. No wonder the wait is so long outside! 2oz of OJ was $2.50\n\nAmbiance- it's a 3 room (1 kitchen, one bar set up, 1 room with 4 tables and seating on bar-like thing looking outside. Think they can seat ~20 people inside?  Poor decor, crappy furniture.... they must make a ton of money because none of it is going into the location/upkeep/decor.\n\nDon't even think about coming here with more than 6 people.... Where will you put them? Wait til the restaurant clears so you have a room to yourself?  ha...\n\nOnce again, OVER-RATED.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Totally worth the wait, for all the people complaining about the wait... If you dont have the patience to wait for quality food, call ahead or go to Denny's. Their portions are very large, and honestly I don't get why that is a complaint, get a togo box and enjoy the rest of your lunch or breakfast later.\n Everyone is always friendly who works there and you have to respect the fact that almost all of there food is locally sourced.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	yummy yummy.  I love Matt's big breakfast, and return frequently.  I never mind the wait the staff is amazing and courteous.  The food is fresh and delicious and rotating specials allow you to try different things from their menu.  I am a huge fan :)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I think there was way...too much hype for this little place. The food is good, but it wasn't worth waiting over an hour to eat here. I was lucky enough to have come by here and while waiting I walked over to the Farmer's Market, it helped kill my waiting time and standing in the heat. \nNo joke that the place is tiny. They do have a friendly staff and have lots of staff to help with the crowds they get. So the service is good.\nI had The Chop & Chick, the chop was pretty tasty. The homefries were just okay, the hash browns tasted better. I also tried The Five Spot and it was good. There are lots of great reviews on the bacon from this place and...it is good, but I wouldn't want to pay $2.50 for a side order of bacon.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My favorite breakfast place for breakfast. Try the hog and chick . Daily specials are sure to please
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I ordered Huevos rancheros. It's pretty good. Very good service. Good food. The sandwhich looks good. Good pork chop. Weird restroom place.  There were lots of people lining up to just get into the restaurant. It's easier to get into the restaurant in singles than as in a group. FYI. Great hidden place to dine in.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ok, I have to admit I'm a secret admirer of Matt's delicious ever so crunchy, thick and well seasoned bacon!! Bacon, Bacon, Bacon is what keeps me coming back to Matt's Big Breakfast and of course their pancakes, pork chops, omelets, hash browns, home fries...\n\nThis place is small as many Yelpers have stated already and no thanks to Guy and his "Triple D" it's hard to find the right time to come to Matt's with out having to wait due to all the foodie followers of Food Network.  \n\nThe service at Matt's is what you make of it. If your in a rush, let your server know and she will accommodate you, but if you don't say anything you'll wait for refills. \n\nAs many Yelpers have already stated their food is amazing!  Matt uses the freshest ingredients, most of which are organic and locally grown.  I had something not on their normal menu: scrambled eggs with sliced chorizo, jalapeños and cheesy goodness with a side of their hash browns, toast and of course bacon!  It was FANTASTIC! Great combination and it wasn't spicy at all!  Ask for it when you go, you must try it!! They bacon and chorizo are made special for Matt at a market.  He uses Wildflower's bread and the egg and veggies are all from local farmers.\n\nRecommendation:  Stacy C is right, the best time to come is during the week and in the early or late morning.  Plan a business breakfast in lieu of a luncheon.  We went last week and the three of us had problem finding a table, be it a small table : -)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The food at Matt's Big Breakfast is pretty great. I defy you to find a better omelette anywhere in town.  However...\n\nI don't know why they had to go ahead and screw up perfectly good food with such terrible service.  Do not go to Matt's if you are thirsty. It takes forever to get your drinks and forget about re-fills. The waiters all act like you are bothering them if you ask for anything. The act like the good food gives them carte blanche to drop the ball on service entirely. Also - STOP using so much OIL. Yucky!\n\n***Edited on 10/07 to add the following: The staff at Matt's must be reading all the Yelp's about their poor service because I went back there today and they were really NICE! It was the first time they have ever been so attentive, quick and nice. And they were not just nice to me. They were nice to everyone. It was awesome! There is one kind of bitchy, slow, mean waitress who was not there today - so maybe everyone is in a better mood on her day off. I hope this trend of excellent service at Matt's continues. It it does I will re-Yelp with only positive things to say. Except...still...chill out with the oil!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Let's be positive.  Matt's has the best waffles I have ever had. And the pancakes are pretty darn amazing. \n\nBut, Matt's has too many rules. Especially for a diner-style resturant. I feel like every time I go there, I leave being pissed off about something.\n\nFirst, NO substituions.  I'm a vegetarian and most of their dishes come with a side a meat.  I would rather have a side of potatoes (and that is cheaper for the resturant than a side of meat). But, NO substituions. I have to order "no meat" and then pay for a side of potatoes. C'mon, now.\n \nAlso, NO outside beverages.  Matt's is located in an epicenter of amazing local coffee shops.  I would like to enjoy a handcrafted latte from Lola's instead of Matt's drip with breakfast - but the waitress will jump on your butt about that coffee cup before you even sit down.\n \nLoosen up, Matt. It's a diner.\n\nAwesome tip: Matt's does take-out orders. If you're craving some yummy pancakes on a Sunday morning and have no desire to stand outside for 90 minutes - call it in! It will be ready in 15 minutes and you can enjoy a local latte with it!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	my best friend and I went to Matt's Big Breakfast a few weeks ago after I read the rave reviews here on yelp.\n\npostitives: free parking, HUGE portions, delicious food taste just like your grandmothers big yummy breakfast, really cute and quaint decor, we were seated immediately, great location downtown phoenix. I ordered the cheese omelet, it came quick and it was gigantor and delicious, thick slices of toast came with it and my hashbrows were the best I've ever tasted in life\n\nnegatives: it can not be underemphasized how miniature this place is, very small menu options, cost is a bit inflated\n\nI recommend it for a try.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We decided that we would take in another great breakfast this Saturday at Matt's.  The food again was awesome that is not my beef.  We arrived at 0600 and our course there was no one else there since they still didnt open until 0630.  The employees were busy getting ready for the day.  Meanwhile some other customers started showing up and it seemed that a few of them knew each other so they must be regulars there.  \n\nThe door opened and 0630 and a young blond lady invited us in with the others that were waiting.  This is were it happened!   I walked in the door and chose a table to the right and was informed that "that table is set for three".   WTF??    We were the first people in the door and anyone who has ever eaten knows that it is open seating and if seats are not available then you put your name on a notebook sheet of paper by the door and wait.  So, we sat down and watched three "men"  cruise over to the table "set for three"....   I guess that they get prefered seating over other customers.   I know it sounds petty but the tone of little blondy completely pissed me off.......  I dont think it was right and I think her tone was rude and you could tell she really didnt care what we thought about it..\n\nI will think again before returning to eat here.   There are a lot of choices alot closer to home for breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I arrived in Phoenix from San Francisco and was starving so I Yelp'ed breakfast joints in the area and Matt's Big Breakfast was one of the places with the most quality reviews so I said why not?\n\nUpon arriving there were a number of small parties waiting outside so I knew it was going to be a long wait. Me and my sister ended up waiting an hour as the morning Phoenix sun started creeping up on us. We were able to sit at the counter which was awesome because I was able to see Matt cook in the kitchen. I ordered the hog and chick which consisted of scrambled eggs, fat slices of bacon, hash brown and wheat toast. In addition I ordered the orange juice which was freshly squeezed. The toast is freaking amazing! Best toast I've ever had! The homemade jam was tasteful because it didn't taste like the nasty jam you would get at normal diners. The hash brown was perfect! Crispy brown on the top and bottom and juicy in the inside. The hash brown was the best I've had because it wasn't dry which makes eating that much more enjoyable. The bacon... It was freaking delicious! 4 fat slices of bacon. Yum! I rarely finish my breakfast but I surprisingly finished the hog and chick plate at Matt's.\n\nI will most definitely be back if I'm ever in then phoenix area. This is the best breakfast joint in Arizona and maybe the west coast. Try it out but beware of the wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	3.5 stars!\n\nThere is a huge hype about this place. It was featured on tv. I get there early to eat here with my brother in law and there was a half hour wait. While we were waiting, a huge line started forming to the outside of the restaurant around 8:30am on a Friday. \n\nMy brother in law had the special of the day, which was a chipotle jalepeno sausage and cheddar scramble served with potatoes and a tortilla instead of toast. I ordered the Salami scramble. I liked his dish because the chipotle sausage was spicy and full of flavor! My Salami scramble was good, but on the salty side. The salami was cut similar to fries, in long rectangular thick pieces. For some reason, I expected thin slices, but it was good all the same. The "home fries" looked more like a hashbrown cassarole and were much, much better than the regular breakfast potatoes. The home fries were my favorite part about being there, more than the salami scramble itself. \n\nThe side of sourdough toast that came with my meal was impressive. The toast appeared to be nearly 2 inches thick, and that was a single slice! It was served with a savory homemade marmalade. \n\nThe owner and the servers there were very friendly, and despite the chaos of the line of people waiting and people constantly checking to see if a spot opened up yet, the staff handled it very well! That alone I give them 4 stars. \n\nFor being a big breakfast, I'd say that my dish was just the "right portion size for me." For some place with big breakfast in the title, if the portion is just right for me, that means that the dish is on the smaller side. \n\nAfter telling about my experience to another friend, who adores this restaurant, I guess I was supposed to order the pancakes, because they are ridiculously good. I've yet to experience those pancakes. If I'm in the area, I will definitely stop by this place again and give it another try, but I'm not sure if it's worth the 40 minute drive from where I live to wait another hour to get a table once I get there, so that's why I took away half a star, but I still really like the place.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I must say that this place was pretty darned good. They open at 6:30 AM on Sunday and there was already a line. The whole place was full upon the doors opening, great sign. They have a very small menu but it certainly covers all of your breakfast needs.\n\nI opted for three sides, a pancake, rosemary homestyle potatoes and rye toast with jam. I asked my waitress which to order, the hashbrowns or the homestyle potatoes and she steered me towards my final choice. I'm glad I listened to her as they were delicious, covered with onions, olive oil and rosemary, the were cooked perfectly. They were some of the freshest potatoes I've had for breakfast in a long time. They weren't greasy at all. I felt like I had just gone to the Farmers' Market, chopped these up and cooked them myself for a Sunday brunch at home.\n\nThe pancake was good, nothing outside the ordinary. You can tell by the photo that there wasn't too much love in making it. For some reason the syrup was very good, I'm not quite sure what they used, it was a pancake syrup but obviously not the generic diner variety. The rye and jam were fantastic, just look at how thick the slice was cut, I've never seen a rye like that. I wish other places would serve their breads like this. I'd be a huge fan of any place that cut their slices in this manner.\n\nI would certainly go out of my way to eat here again. The staff were terrific, the place was spotless, the owner walked around and spoke with all diners (it seemed like everyone was a local) and the food was great. The prices have risen, at least since their website has been in place but it's still a good deal (the $5 Spot is now $5.75). A great place to grab a Big Breakfast in a nice atmosphere.\n\nI have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I heard lots of good stuff regarding this place so I decided to check it out and here's what I concluded\n\n1. Space: first of all this place is really, really, really tiny so sitting situations are way too close for comfort.  I recommend small party with 4 people max.\n\n2. Menu: just because its listed does not mean its available.\n\n3. Quality: not so great, my hash browns were burnt (more like hash blacks) and the rest of the food too greasy. I myself is not a big fan of Fat.\n\n4. Beverage: uh, I rather go to Circle K and get a cup.\n\n5: Service: ok, but for such a limited customers how can service go wrong?\n\n\n\nAll in all I was not impress with this place.  I even went back for lunch thinking maybe it was only during breakfast that this place lacked the hype that everybody was talking about, but once again I very disappointed.  \n\nBTW i like my Burger with Butter and not Butter with Burger.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Because of the name of the restaurant and the line outside, I gained certain expectations. I was expecting a BIG BREAKFAST and amazing tasting food. However, I was disappointed. \n\nI had the Chop and Chick with home fries. This item was not worth the wait or the price. The serving size was small. The taste was forgettable. \n\nI also had the Waffle, which saved the experience. I have to admit it was tasty. I love a waffle where the batter is sweet and doesn't need too much syrup. Also, it came with a slice of bacon, which had a kick to it making it super good. Lastly, it was decently priced. I was close to saying that it's worth the wait, but I found out it's not too hard to make a similar waffle at home by just adding malt to your waffle mix. \n\nThis wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast, but if you're like me and you like to try places featured on the Food Network, just order the bacon. It's unique and different.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Obviously I've been here for breakfast.  I got the steak and eggs and I was amazed.  This amazement isn't from the steak or the eggs, even though they were both delicious, but it was with the toast.  I have never had such great toast before, and the jam was so fresh....\n\nThe wait was long, and we were there in July.  Limited shade outside, but at least they had a water jug for the people waiting.  I recommend preparing for the heat if you decide to go during the summer.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This restaurant is hard to describe.  The restaurant itself and the menu are really simple, breakfast staples, but they are done so well that they taste better! All ingredients are local and organic.   I always try to do the "special", which is usually a type of scramble.  Always delicious!  There are only about 7 tables in the whole place, so I left off a star for the wait you will see on the weekends.  However, it is 100% worth the wait!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Hey this place is a classic down town breakfast joint. They sure dont need a A+ review from me, but what the hell. This Place Is Awesome.I love riding my bike to this funky little diner. I always get the breakfast special; this time it was scrambled eggs, ham, fresh jalapenos, and pepper jack cheese, with a side of home frys. Holy Sh** it was good! Everything is super fresh, affordable, and clean. The portions are big, so be mindful of spiting with a friend if so inclined. Also I would recommend getting your delicious food to go and sit in the park just to the south. The wait to sit inside can be very long.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We went early, 8am on a Sunday for breakfast.  There was a 5 minute wait (although they don't quote wait times), and we sat at the bar counter.  The coffee was delicious, as was the daily lemonade.  We ordered an egg special with country sausage patties, homefries, and toast.  My husband is a huge sausage fan, and he thought it was very good.  The bacon was delish, and the pancakes were simply but fluffy and flavorful.  We will be back, but we will go early because by the time we left, there was a very lengthy wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	There will be a line ... you will wait - probably for an hour ... and you'll be happy you did. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. The burger was one of the best I have ever had. \n\nDon't let the appearance of the building scare you off. Make it happen. This place lives up to the hype.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We got to Matt's on a Sunday afternoon and only waited about 15 minutes! Hooray, what a good start to what I hoped would be the best breakfast/brunch experience I've had in my 7 years in Phx! The service was outstanding, too!\n\n My fiancé got the Salami Scramble and I got the Chick and Chop. Maybe it's because I grew up in the south where food like this is pretty standard, but I really didn't taste anything special about the breakfast, even though I really wanted to have the "foodgasm" that so many others here claim. The hashbrowns were good, but very, very greasy, and my porkchop was overcooked and very dried out, and was completely overpowered by Rosemary, which I typically love. \n\nMy highest compliments go to the honey lemonade, the berry preserves we were given for the thick sourdough bread, and, of course, the waitstaff! Overall, I think the place is overhyped, much like Pizzeria Bianco, but worth a shot for the experience.  I personally would have felt robbed had I waited more than 15 minutes and gotten food that just made me go "eh."
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Breakfast does not get any better.  After eating the bacon at this restaurant, I can't order bacon at any other breakfast joints... it simply does not compare.  They use thick, smoked bacon that is incredible.  Definitely worth the extra dollars.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	took car for repairs this early this morning and had time before taking friend to work so he said, "Where are we going for breakfast?"  I said, "I don't know, where are you taking me?"  Realized we were in area of Matt's Big Breakfast, looked it up on Yelp for address and decided to try it.  Special today was Eggs Benedict with choice of hash browns or home fries.  I normally don't like poached eggs but thought I'd give it a try.  Glad I did.  The hollandaise sauce was delicious, the canadian bacon was very flavorful, nice sized english muffin and I choose hash browns which were soft and moist but a little too dark.  friend got the 3 egg salami sopprosata omelete (sure spelled wrong) with hash browns and oj.  the homemade, organic strawberry preserves they serves with his toast was amazing.  not too tart, not too sweet, just wonderful.  \n\nwill go back again, however, probably not during the snowbird season.  we were able to get right in this morning and we did hear some regulars talk about how it was nice to see so many people in there today, considering it's now off season for visitors.  apparently, as others have indicated, there can be very long waits to get in.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I don't see what the hype is about. Food was good, bacon was incredible but I won't make the 20 minute drive back and 20-30 minute wait to eat there again. Also, not a good spot to bring kids.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	A really nice place for breakfast, especially on weekdays. The wait in weekends makes it a bit hard to justify at times, and the crowd feels different - folks in their groups who aren't as willing to socialize with others. The weekday crowd feels like more of a community - more solo diners willing to chat. \n\nFood is solid all around - I've had almost everything on the menu and thus stick to the specials most days. You can't go wrong if you're looking for a hearty, well-prepared breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This has to be the best breakfast I've ever had!  I ordered the special which was scrambled eggs with sweet peppers, whiskey fennel sausage and Havarti cheese.  It was outstanding!  We had to wait for over an hour which we knew that going in.  The food was definitely worth the wait.  Looking forward to going back again!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	It appears as if my first review of this fine establishment was pushing the envelope a bit, so allow me to reintroduce my opinion of one of my favorite places to dine in this city. \n\nMatt Pool and his breakfast restaurant have received national critical acclaim for their use of local, fresh, organic ingredients and their simple traditional preparation of American breakfast classics. \n\nThe number one complaint I encounter about this restaurant is the wait. Of course there's a wait, it's probably the most famous breakfast joint in this state, and there's a reason people flock to it 6 days a week: because its really good food served by a really good staff. I'm sure that the people who complain about the wait here are the same people who complain about the wait at Pizzeria Bianco. \n\nTo all of those people, I pose this question to you: since when has dining out in America become this rush to get in, stuff your gullet and get out as fast as possible? Why is dining in this country no longer about the experience and the socialization you get with your fellow diners? Why not come downtown, sign up for a table, and then stroll down to Fair Trade for a latte while you wait, or take a nice walk around and see what the Roosevelt district has to offer? We're always in such a hurry...I say it's nice to slow down, spend some time with our friends and family and nosh on a breakfast that is totally worth the wait. I believe that many restaurants have spoiled the average American consumer with instant gratification--how many times have you refused to wait at a restaurant because the wait was 30+ minutes? We want good food, and we want it now, screw everyone else, and if you can't feed our bellies within 30 minutes, we'll take our business somewhere else. This attitude is crap. \n\nYou have to slow down and appreciate how hard this little restaurant works. Matt's wife is there 6 days a week to ensure that their business is performing at the level at which it should. The kitchen staff is there from 6:00 am to almost 4pm sometimes churning out thousands of plates of fried eggs, thick peppered bacon, hash browns, home fries, pancakes, pork chops, burgers...The point is, a lot of love and thought has gone into this restaurant to make sure that every single ingredient put on your plate is of the highest quality possible and is prepared by a very talented kitchen staff. \n\nIt is a small restaurant, but it's always warm and inviting, and the coffee is always hot and fresh and they might not serve you a huge glass of orange juice, but it's always 100% fresh, squeezed that morning by the staff. \n\nAfter my plea to try and understand the other side of this restaurant, I know that I may not have been able to make everyone stop and reconsider any opinions they might have about this place: the wait, the small serving of orange juice, the confined areas, and that's OK. All I'm saying is that this place is an institution in downtown dining...and it's really nice to go an experience the food, the service and the though that goes into running this business if only every once in a blue moon. And if not, that's OK, because there are plenty of people who will gladly take your place in line.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Griddlecakes and bacon were fabulous.  As others have said expect a wait.  The place is TINY.  Servers were really nice.  I had griddlecakes, bacon and a diet RC and with tip it was $16.  Portions were generous and I was only able to eat one pancake.  Another side note is it's so tiny your wait is outside... Consider the weather.  There is no shade.  I thought it was worth it but I am not sure I'd wait again.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	There are very few places that I'm completely OK with waiting thirty to forty-five minutes to eat breakfast, much less in the Phoenix heat, but when it comes to Matt's Big Breakfast I don't think twice about it.  It's actually a regular occurrence, while sitting on the outdoor waiting benches, for the guests who are leaving to assure you it is worth the wait.\n\nThe place is small, you might even say cramped depending on where you are sat, but the food is second to none.  I always get the special, which varies from day to day.  It's typically a scrambler with generous helpings of meat and cheese, and some locally grown veggies or peppers.  I recommend a side of home fries with rosemary as opposed to the hash browns.  If you're not in the mood for eggs try the waffle or pancakes (seriously it's just all good), and if bread doesn't come with what you order you've got to try the sourdough toast with house made organic blueberry jelly...so delicious.\n\nIn addition to the amazing food, the service is always great.  Hands down, Matt's Big Breakfast is my favorite breakfast stop.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I went to Matt's BB for the first time last weekend.  Took me a moment to get oriented - it's not immediately obvious if you present yourself inside to get on a list or not.  The answer: not.  You sign yourself in.  Once we had that figured out, we waited - but not for as long as I thought.  They certainly have an efficient little operation.  The staff brought out menus for any large parties so the kitchen could start in on their order before they were seated.\n\nOnce inside, we were greeted warmly and had our orders taken promptly.  My wife tried the special - an odd scramble of eggs, spinach and chicken sauage.  She got hers with hashbrowns and some really nice, thick, fibrous toast.  I had a few bites of her toast and was frankly tempted to order some for myself.  I thought the hashbrowns were OK, but I am not crazy about hashbrowns.\n\nI ended up with a bowl of their steel-cut oatmeal, which came with raisins and brown sugar (and milk), then got a side of the homefries.  Sure glad I ordered that side - they were the highlight of the meal.  Perfectly cooked, with nice big chunks of potato, slightly blackened, with fresh rosemary.  Now, I am not always enthusiastic about rosemary.  Can be too strong.  But they'd added the perfect amount.  \n\nI commented to my wife that I could see coming there and having a couple orders of their homefries as my meal - they were that satisfying.  \n\nThe oatmeal was also very tasty.  I wasn't going to bother with it until I saw it was steel-cut.  It was my first time having steel-cut oatmeal at a restaurant, and I enjoyed the contrast to the typical restaurant oatmeal. \n\nSomeone at the next table ordered the pancakes, and they looked fantastic. \n\nService was very attentive and efficient.  We'll definitely be back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This was one of the best brunches I've had anywhere. The servers were very knowledgeable and eager to share their opinion on what's best on the menu. Honestly, everything looked appealing. The portions are fair, the prices even fairer, and the food all excellent. My waffle with two slices of bacon was the best waffle and best bacon I've had. Bacon was thick, not too fatty, and perfectly charred. Waffle had texture and crisp. Real maple syrup on the side :) The special chorizo, jalapeno scramble was nice and hot and spicy! Definitely coming back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The one star review is because having to wait in the heat totally ruined the whole meal. Seeing there were over 600 yelp reviews, I was expecting to wait. However, if you are successful enough to have a long wait for your restaurant, you should provide something to keep the waiting customers cool. Misters maybe? Maybe expand to have a foyer? \n\nWe waited in the 100+ heat for 40+ minutes. They have a list outside you write your name on so no one is there to tell you how long your wait will be. They provide minimal seating and no misters. There's some ice water with oranges to drink with tiny dixie cups (the kind the dentist provides to swish with). By the time we had our pre-order (where they take your order 10 minutes before they seat you so you don't take up a table too long), I wasn't very hungry and definitely didn't want hot eggs.  After finally getting seated, we immediately have hot plates set down in front of us. \n\nI ordered the BLT (again, I did NOT want eggs when I was so hot!) and it just wasn't that good. Way too much crusty bread that scratched the roof of my mouth. The three people I was with ordered scrambles and said they were nothing they couldn't get elsewhere. The bacon and the waffles were very good. \n\nThe wait staff was very friendly and apologetic but it's not their fault and there's nothing they can say to make up for being terribly uncomfortable.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This morning's target was Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix. After all of the media hype over this little original were they going to be as good as promised?\n\nWe were thrilled to find that Matt's is very close to the Light Rail stop at Roosevelt and Central, so we took the train and didn't have to worry about finding a parking spot. A very good thing as it turns out as there are a few parking lots near Matt's but all of them were full.\n\nI had heard that's Matt's was small, but I was not prepared for just how small. One car garage small. Including the kitchen! This causes a major problem for hungry customers, the wait was nearly two hours! Wow, this place must be great if people are willing to stand out in the rain for nearly two hours to get in.\n\nOnce we were inside and seated things actually moved pretty quickly. We actually had food inside of ten minutes of ordering. The only con inside I saw really was how loud it was. But hey, I could live with that.\n\nThe food was very good. My wife had the Chop and Chix, a lovely seasoned pork chop, eggs perfectly cooked, home style potatoes and toast. I had a Salami Scramble, three eggs, Molinari sopresseta, hash browns and toast. It was all very good, very flavorful.\n\nHowever, after the hype and the nearly 2 hour wait to get in I was expecting outstanding not just very good. The other reality check item for Matt's was the price. I ordered a soda, $2.75, what I received was a 12oz can of soda. Yup, nearly twice the price of a six-pack of soda at any store in town for one can. A 4oz glass of orange juice, granted freshly squeezed, was also nearly $3.00. Hmmm, I didn't order any. \n\nTotal bill for our breakfast was $27.00 plus tip.\n\nBottom line? Matt's Big Breakfast has very good food, but only very good food. There was nothing exceptional here to justify all of the hype, there are many other breakfast places here in town with food at least as good if not better than Matt's for less money and without the marathon wait to get in.\n\nIf you go to Matt's expect to wait at least an hour, you will enjoy the food I promise. Only you can decide if the wait and the price are worth it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What's not to love? \n\nCool small-diner atmosphere, crazy good food, ginormous portions, decent coffee (so many places underestimate the power of a good cup of joe), and you can laugh at Guy's stencil near the register. \n\n4-egg chorizo and jalapeno scramble... if you see it on the board, GET IT.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Really fantastic breakfast. Not for vegetarians, I guess, because one of my dining companions was not impressed (except, I think she liked the eggs), but I was in hog heaven. Great atmosphere in a city bereft of great atmosphere. Seriously. I asked the hot counter girl what there is to do in Phoenix. She seemed confused by the question. But at least she was hot. Yeah, sorry for even going there, but all the women who worked at Matt's when I was there were really friggin' hot, and I can't honestly say as an honest Yelp reviewer that it didn't count as a factor in the number of times I returned here. But what I can also say is that I wouldn't have gone near the place, hot serving wenches notwithstanding, had the food not been completely, utterly satisfying. Totally worth a drive across the "city" for. Really. I mean. Being from New York, I tend to compliment nobody. I enjoyed Matt's. So congratulations, management. You hired the right people. You cook a mean egg. You know what to do with pork. All of this was appetizing, satisfying, and filling. YUM.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Love their cheeseburger, can tell it's real meat no 90% fillers! Hotcakes, real maple syrup and best bacon ever! Do expect about 1 to 1hr1/2 wait but totally worth it!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	GRANDMA !!!!!! ARE YOU BACK IN THAT KITCHEN?? GET OUT OF THERE!!! \n\nThat's basically how I always describe this place.. "Its grandma breakfast"... you know fresh, cooked to order, and way too much! \n\nI have always loved Matts and have been coming for many years...the only thing I hate.. the wait.. (well, that and the unfinished, sloppy paint job in the dining room) \n\nThe food is ALWAYS great here... their pork products are amazing! Super fresh cage-fee chicken eggs, local produce and hearty THICKLY sliced breads served with a side of strawberry lavender preserves... yummy. If you're not in a hurry and have the time to endure the wait... this place is HIGHLY recommended! \n\nAlthough my grandma left me many years ago... her breakfast spirit lives here!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I had my first experience with Matt's this morning. A friend of mine had seen it on Diner's, Dives and Drive In's (or something along those lines) and was excited to try it out. The wait was about 20 minutes(arrived at 9 am) and seating is very limited but worth it!\n\nI'm all about the breakfast food so I was excited to try somewhere new. The menu is limited but covers all bases. The coffee (a special blend just for them) is local as is everything that they serve. I swear the bacon tastes better when it's from around the corner.\n\nI decided on the belgian waffle and a side of hash browns. SUPER YUMMY!! I appreciate the note on the menu that they only use butter and extra virgin olive oil... No trans fats here! The hash browns were a bit oily but tasty overall.\n\nAs I was leaving I saw a huge stack of pancakes on their way to a table... I know what I'm getting next time!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I never thought I would say this, but I recently had a breakfast better than one consumed at Matt's.  It's best not to go any further.  That being said, whenever I am off on a weekday, the urge to go to Matt's emerges at the crack of dawn and does not subsist until I have either satiated myself with hash browns at their tiny digs or have painfully decided to deny myself the rich excess.\n\nThe wait is almost always 45 minutes even if you are a party of 1.  Going later helps reduce the wait.  Sometimes.  The wait though only builds the appetite and anticipation.  This is food that deserves such dedication.\n\nI almost exclusively get the special.  And they are all special.  However, the most special of all specials was my first and one that I hope will make a comeback soon.  Imagine for yourself: Chicken Artichoke Sausage, Fresh Mozzarella, Organic Spinach (locally grown, mind you), Hash Browns, and Whole Wheat Toast (with some local fruit preserves that they like to give a lot of props to when they deliver it to you).\n\nAlso, cheers to the wait staff who work frantically in such a small space.  I also appreciate their sort of Mother Hubbard, pseduo-indie, partially jeans and a t-shirt dress code.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Yummy hidden gem in downtown Phoenix, though since Food Network has been there, the place has exploded. This is a tiny converted house and boy is it small. The inside is cute though and there are tables packed in along with a counter top bar.\n\nThe wait is long, and it is also worth it. The best days to go of course are the weekdays. Just avoid the weekend period. Local eggs, cheeses and milk. Local goods in general. The coffee was to die for! Home made jam! Thick cut delicious BACON! Do stop here.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I am another who does not understand the hype about this diner. I have been there twice.  I have had the waffles and hash browns.   The waffles were soggy and the hash browns were very greasy (both times).  I could have done that at home without the 45 minute wait.  Plus, the coffee is putrid.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Been to Matt's one time and that is enough for me to know this place is one of a Kind.  From the awesome friendly service, to the amazing meals, to the distinctly delicious honey lemonade and FRESHLY squeezed OJ, to the Fresh flowers on the table, Its truly a place I hope to make a habit of!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We were 50/50 on this one. I hated my meal the salami scrambled, but Christina enjoyed her St Louis special.  If I went back would stick w/ the waffle. Very small place cant say I would wait an hour to eat here.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What can I say that hasn't been said about this place, other than the fact that my dad was visiting from Mexico and found this place as he strolled through Downtown back when this place first opened and recommended it to me. \nHigh wait times are WORTH THE WAIT. Even the water with lemon they have outside for you while you wait is delicious and satisfying. I always go for the special, and my oh my it has never disappointed.\nYou can tell the difference between this place and other breakfast joint once you taste their food, its natural, organic, with lots of flavor and it smells fresh. \nTheir rosemary garlic potatoes are the best, their pancakes are a trip to Neverland, and their coffee is just as good as the one at a Starbucks. \nThis place has a special place in my heart because I remember going to it when the hype hadnt started and I hardly to wait to eat there at first, so I am glad for them because they really deserve all of the attention that they get for their delicious food. Plus, the owners wife always remembers me and even tells me she hasnt seen me in a long time when I go, its just a wonderful place that knows how to treat its customers and how to keep em happy.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Amazing place!!!   I love breakfast places and have been to many great ones all over the USA, but I think this is the best one I have visited.\nWhile staying Sheraton a couple blocks away, for a work trip, I woke up early to be at the front door at the 6:30am opening.\n\n-Great food (large portions and fresh ingredients)\n-Best bacon I have ever had\n-Friendly Staff and excellent service\n-Small venue\n-Long wait if you don't arrive early (If you come solo wait is much shorter)\n\nIf I ever get back to Phoenix I will be go straight to Matt's!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Great Food. Great Coffee. Great Service. Amazing Hash-browns! Can't wait to go back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's Big Breakfast should be at the top of anyone's Phoenix "Must" list. All of the food is locally sourced and served up so fresh you really can taste it. Everything from their kick ass bacon to their bread to their coffee and juice will knock your socks off with their freshness. It is no surprise that even on a summer's day people sit outside in the heat and wait for a table.\n\nI'm surprised by comments about the service here because all of the girls came out to check on those of us waiting outside and even took our orders in advance so they would be prepared the moment we were seated. Everyone working there was very sweet.\n\nMy last visit was a sad one however because I was suffering from a brief but very severe hangover (what I like to call an Express Hangover) that was so bad all I could manage was a few sips of juice and coffee. If Matt's is in the future I have to make it a point to behave myself the night before because passing up such a great breakfast is a crime in this Yelper's book!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I had breakfast here on a trip to Phoenix and it was to die for! I got the special which was a 3-egg scramble with cheese, spinach, and ham - SO GOOD. The eggs tasted SO fresh. THE BEST PART - the HASH BROWNS. Oh my gosh, I have never tasted hash browns like that before - they were perfect! Crunchy on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside - yum yum. The toast was made fresh (like my mom's), and was THE best toast I have ever had at a restaurant. Fresh squeezed OJ was dynamite! SO GOOD! Best OJ I have ever had. Even the coffee was good!! Great vibe - really small place so no wonder there is a wait. PLUS, I saw the workers give a little to-go box to one of the homeless guys on the street - LOVE THAT!! Not only does this place have great food and great service, but they are caring people!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Pros:\n\n- Bacon - taste beautiful \n- potatoes - good\n- Waffles tasted homemade\n- Toast - jelly taste homeade\n\nCons\n\n- the wait time.\n- the butter burger could've been better.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Big. Big might be a bit of an understatement when describing this place. The portions are HUGE. I ordered the 3 egg omelette with salami, which also came with hash browns and toast. The 3 eggs was more like 4. Half the plate was eggs/salami, the other half was hash browns. Then she brought the toast out, with a homemade jam. Then I had the nerve to order a side of bacon. \n*sidenote* the bacon was 3 thick strips sprinkled in pepper. When I bit into that first piece, the amalgamation of pepper, maple and succulent pig meat did a slow sensual tango with my tongue. I immediately looked around to see if anyone else was having this same experience. Yes. I was not the only one. Bacon. Get it. *end sidenote*\nThere was so much food I had to map out a quick strategy. Started with the bacon. (BACON. GET IT) then dove into the eggs which was very good. The hash browns were on point, and the jam was very good. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give me a 5 is because of the wait. This is a popular spot, so be prepared to wait about 45 min. The place isn't that big, so we waited out front for just about 45. The wait was def worth it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I really think this is the BEST BREAKFAST I have ever had!  The 3 times I have eaten here it has been an hour and a half wait!  Other than that I would give it 5 stars...Food is great, staff is friendly
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Went here this morning. As usual, the wait was crowded out to the corner of 1st Street. People are willing to wait for good food, I suppose. \n\nOnce you get inside Matt's Big Breakfast (it was about an hour wait for us on a Saturday morning), you see why it took so long. There's about 15 seats in the whole place and it's tiny...like a Manhattan hotel room. People are bumping into each other, sliding around and the commotion is high. It's loud, it's gritty and it's the perfect diner setting.\n\nFor all the press it's gotten, the food better be damn good. And it is. The eggs are cage raised and organic, the pork is from high-quality Iowa farms and most of the produce is local. The fresh-squeezed OJ is legit. And the coffee is from a premium roaster in Cave Creek, AZ. The hash browns are very much like you would find at a joint in the Midwest: buttery on the inside and crispy brown on the outside. \n\nDo yourself a favor and brave the wait and the commotion... it's worth it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I loved this place. The wait was bearable because of my company. If you have the right mate you can withstand any wait,. The food was outstanding the service was awesome and the coffe is from the C-4 coffee house in cave creek way cool! I will be back soon, Matty!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ok, I'm sorry people of Phoenix, but I will go here every time I am in town. I saw it on the triple D and had to try it. We waited for about 20 minutes on a (late) Tuesday morning. I ordered the Butter Burger with Maytag blue cheese and my man ordered the waffle...neither disappointed. The service was fast and friendly. Loved it! Oh yeah, the place is TINY, but who cares when the food is this good?
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's Big Breakfast is THE best breakfast in Phoenix. Fresh, organic, and wherever possible, LOCAL ingredients, cooked up to perfection. Delicious coffee. Crowded, especially on weekends. Worth the wait. Get there early or after rush hour on weekdays. Worth every penny.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Working at a large hotel downtown I am always sending people to Mat's Big Breakfast and I finally had the opportunity to hear what all the talk was about this morning when a friend and I decided to eat there. As usual there was a wait, but there was some seating outside for us. I have to say I really liked the desert landscaping out front. I ordered the special which was an omelet with fresh jalapenos, cheese, with hash browns. I also ordered a side of the bacon which was delicious! Actually it was all delicious. All of the servers were extremely friendly and said goodbye and thank you to every patron that was leaving. The orange juice is also a must to try. It was like they picked an orange right off a tree. I can't wait to give my money to this place because it's local, the food is fresh, and it's just great.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I love this place. I've never had a bad meal there and the staff is wonderful. The only reason I take away one star is because I really just don't like waiting outside. But the griddlecakes and sourdough toast (complete with homemade jam) are amazing!  Hopefully I will be able to visit on a day where I won't have to wait outside for too long.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Cant say much that hasnt been said already.  Matts serves some delicious breakfast.  Yes its small.  Yes theres a wait.  Yes its worth it!  Bring a newspaper or a book, sign your name in and chill out.  At least now they have added a few benches to relax on.  Once inside anything you order will be fresh and delicious.  From amazing waffles, to the freshest fruit, to the tastiest bacon.  If Im in the mood for a bomb breakfast and have some time to kill Matts is at the top of the list.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Could be one of the best breakfast I have eaten outside of my kitchen.   The staff is friendly and the food came out fast and hot. I will be back in the near future.  Order the OJ is is fresh.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'm just piling on at this point, but Matt's is as good as it gets.  Reminds me of big homemade farmboy breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Proof that great things come in small packages :)\nMatt's Big Breakfast is SMALL, lol!\n \nThe local organic coffee that they serve is awesome & I have to drink it even when I'm melting outside. \nMy must have, by far though, is the honey lemonade.... oh yeah! \n\nEverything they make is fresh, organic & delicious. I had the breakfast special. I have to say that the eggs tasted a bit different to me, but maybe it's because I've rarely had REAL eggs before, lol. I'm used to the thin shelled, mass produced, break up a bunch & keep them in a container till someone orders something with eggs in it kind of taste. They don't even crack them open until they are making your order. Cage free eggs from happy well fed chickens is the way to go :)\n\nThe only con I have to point out is the waiting line if you don't get yourself down there early enough. Especially in this heat! My friend decided that we should, but if her makeup started melting off we'd have to find somewhere else for breakfast, lol. Fortunately, we were called in just on time!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Rather than making this another dissertation on every detail of my restaurant experience, I'll try for once to keep it short and sweet. I came here on a Tuesday morning with my friend and my toddler, after a short wait we were seated. We both ordered the bacon and eggs with hash browns. Mine scrambled, hers sunny side up and I also got a pancake on the side for the toddler and me to share (so he wouldn't steal all of my scrambled eggs). The food came pretty quickly and everything was good. My friend said the hash browns were better seasoned last time she was there (they needed a little salt). They were actually made from honest to god, real potatoes, and when was the last time you saw that? I saw in the reviews that they have the best scrambled eggs but I wouldn't go that far. They were good. They also needed a sprinkling of salt and pepper but they were not the best. You have to go to Essence for that. The bacon was nice and thick and delicious and the raisin bread that came with my breakfast delighted my toddler. My pancake was OK. It tasted like a typical good restaurant buttermilk pancake. It did come with warm syrup though and that always makes me happy. Would I come here again? Sure! Would I wait in line on a Saturday for an hour and half? Are you f-ing kidding me?
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I have been here probably five times, but not for awhile.  The only reason for that is that, by the time I'm ready to get breakfast, I'm pretty hungry and can't stand waiting 30 minutes to an hour to get in.  Last Sunday, I actually packed a snack and sat on the curb to face 45 long, hard minutes of being tantalized by delicious smelling food.\n\nI had forgotten just how great this place is.  The service is super friendly and very efficient.  Once you get in, you get served very quickly.  I could swear that they laid down our enormous spread of food within 5 minutes of us ordering, and it's not old, sitting-around-under-a-heat-lamp stuff, it's hot and fresh.  I got some eggs (fresh and cooked to perfection), and wheat toast which was thick cut and had some delicious local strawberry preserves with it, but the standout is always the hashbrowns.  They are the stuff of dreams: a giant, salty, crisp on the outside/soft on the inside, just greasy enough slab of heaven.  Sweet Pea got his usual Hog n Chick that comes with the thickest, most peppery bacon I've ever seen.  And THEN we split a waffle, also delicious (not as outstanding as the rest, but I'm not usually a waffle person.)\n\nIf you want the real deal, a straight-up BREAKFAST - no frills and newfangled foods, but just really quality delicious stuff, then pack a snack and get to Matt's. Nobody does it better.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Simple, wholesome ingredients, unpretentious food = home run breakfast.  Coffee was the only let down, it was decidedly watered-out, the classic dinner coffee.  \n\nSign up for a spot on the waiting list and check out the farmer's market that's kitty-corner on Saturdays.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	On my recent vacation I learned that Guy Fieri can be trusted with any food decision. \n\nWe waited 1.5 hours on a Saturday morning to get in to Matt's, and I would wait longer next time if I had to. \n\nThe staff was incredibly friendly and the food was beyond description. \n\nI ordered the Five Spot, a side of Home fries, and a Honey Lemonade. \n\nThe Five Spot was a breakfast sandwich featuring a fried egg, thick cut bacon, cheese, and grilled onions. Its possible that there was another element on the sandwich, but I was in taste heaven and didn't stop to consider what the sandwich was made of.... My home fries were thick cut potatoes with lots of grilled onions and large pieces of rosemary. The large pieces allowed for the flavor to permeate, and I was able to pick around them so that it didn't feel that I was chewing on little sticks. \n\nThe honey lemonade was so great that I ordered a second glass to-go! \n\nMatt's is small and seats only 25 diners at a time, but it is definitely a flavor powerhouse! \n\nFrom now on, I will encourage anyone I know traveling to Phoenix to stop by Matt's. It was fantastic.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Wait, you're shitting me, right?  35mins+ wait in the hot sun to eat bacon and eggs?  No way.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Went for the first time this week.  I don't stand in line for eggs, so went for lunch.  REALLY good chili.  There wasn't a wait at lunch time mid week.  It's noisy, so it's best for a casual, catching up with friends lunch- not for 'business'.  I would go again.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We stayed at the Sheraton downtown and Matt's was a short walk.  Definitely worth the walk, and it helped to justify eating such a large breakfast.  There is probably something there that is not very good, but we did not find it.  When you get there, make sure you check in with the person running the register
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	http://stevelerer.com\n\nI traveled to Phoenix only a few days away from the LA marathon in March and was determined to start carbo loading early. My first stop was Matt's Big Breakfast, a place I had patroned back in 2010. That time I ordered the item that Guy tried on triple D and it was really good. He ordered the chop and the chick which was a pork chop and two fried eggs. It was delicious, with a great pesto topping, I only wished I could have had more pesto but they may have given it to me if I had asked.\n\nThe restaurant is small usually with a 10 minute wait even for one person. I didn't mind and hung out with the locals for a little bit before I was able to sit at the bar. The decor and ambiance is not much different than most other small breakfast spots but it is clean and welcoming. The staff was nice and took my order quickly and it was only a short while before my order of the hog and the chick was in front of me. Placed at my spot of the counter was beautifully cooked think cut peppered bacon, crispy hashbrowns, and two perfectly cooked over medium eggs. Everything on the plate was cooked really well and was a perfect breakfast. The eggs were right under medium which is where I like them and the hashbrowns were crunchy and crispy on the outside while still creamy on the inside. Somewhat like a potato latke, just without all the onion. By far the star on the plate was the think cut bacon. Sometimes when a restaurant says that the bacon is think cut it really isn't and other times it is so thick that it comes out uncooked. Matt's got it just right and peppered right to the edge of too much. Just where I like it. I could have eaten platefuls of this stuff, if only they were in LA at the end of the marathon.\n\nThe last thing in my order was the real reason I returned to Matt's. Each breakfast arrives with a side of bread of which you have a few options. Bread aside, the start was the strawberry jam they served on the side. The jam is without a doubt the best thing in the restaurant. It is super sweet with chunks of fruit inside. It has so much flavor in such a simple concoction, I could eat a jar of it. Too bad they only give you about two ounces. I wonder if they bottle and sell it because I would buy.\n\nAll in all Matt's Big Breakfast is a really solid breakfast joint in downtown Phoenix. No wonder it always has a wait. The peppered bacon was delicious and the rest of the meal was nothing to scoff at but, in the end, I would come here every time I visit Phoenix just for the strawberry jam. Check out Matt's Big Breakfast the next time you are in town and let me know what you think.\n\nOverall Review: 7/10
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Recommended by a friend. Don't let first impression fool you. Very small. Air conditiones. Street parking. Service was phenomenal. Food was great. Ate the daily special omelette (3 eggs, turkey sausage, peppers) with tortilla and hash browns. Very good. Will definitely return next time I'm in town.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	In the movie "The 40-Year Old Virgin," there is a line they repeat often to Steve Carrell: "You're putting the pu$$y on a pedestal, that's your problem!"\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast was on a pedestal. We'd tried to go there a couple years ago, but the crowd outside was always too threatening a wait. Then, in August, we tried to go, but when we asked "What's the probable wait time?" We were told, "Oh we don't really provide anyone with wait times." The line outside was pretty long, and there wasn't really any shade, and with no potential end to the wait, we came to terms with the possibility that we'd turn into bacon ourselves sitting outside waiting for a table. \n\nThen this morning I woke up at 6:30am on a Saturday due to insomnia and we said "Hey there might actually not be a line if we go right now."\n\nI just came back from breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast and now I'm waiting for my heart attack.\n\nI'd tried to find out what the big deal was about this greasy spoon so many times in reviews, and nobody ever gave a good explanation in detail of what makes the "traditional breakfast food" so "different."\n\nI ordered the special - which was an egg, cheese, onion and sausage omelette, with hash browns. Since it was our first time there, we also ordered a belgian waffle to split.\n\nThe omelette was more like "Onion and Sausage with a side of egg and cheese." The sausage was giant sliced links, enough to feed an army. The amount of onion was not what I expected - it was probably two entire onions sliced up and thrown in there. The hash browns are a serving for 4 people or something. They're not sliced like ordinary hash browns are sliced - they're ultra skinny slices like angelhair pasta. There are a lot of really crunchy crispy areas of angelhair sliced hash browns which are tasty. Thankfully, they are not all salty. But what sort of human can ingest this much potato in one sitting?\n\nI'm one year away from having been a vegetarian for 5 years, and I was willing to "go there" at this meal because I had to see what everyone was raving about, and I read on the menu that the meat is natural and grain-fed. Not free-range, grass-fed, but at least not corn-fed and hormonalized and antibiotic-ridden. Also, I eat burgers at Delux and Rokerij and I'll eat the prosciutto at Bomberos. So I thought, why not see what the fuss is all about?\n\nIt was a'ight. Not FABULOUS. I tried to figure out why this place is SUCH a big deal to so many. Maybe it is shocking to some people's palates to taste food made with real butter and real cream - people who ordinarily cook at home and fill their cupboards with the healthy substitutes of every ingredient. Or maybe typical people buy Kraft cheese or something, I don't know. The ingredients were definitely "real," which is, I suppose, a big deal if you ordinarily eat Crap for breakfast or eat at Denny's. It most definitely beats "Moons Over My Hammy" for instance.\n\nBut we really missed Pallate, which really WAS the best breakfast downtown.\n\nThe bread they brought for the toast was delicious ... but it's BREAD. Most bread is pretty good. The waffle was uber fluffy. I had a few bites and said "That's a tasty plate of diabetes right there," while I felt my blood sugar go through the roof.\n\nMostly, I really felt a lack in the vegetables department. \n\nI might seem like a health nut, because of this, but trust me, I'm not. I'm a tall, big person and I eat breakfasts at Dick's Hideaway several times a week. It's just that at Dick's Hideaway I can have them substitute the potatoes for veggies (usually asparagus and broccoli), and substitute the meat in the breakfast burrito with avocado. I'm used to having an entire day's worth of greens at breakfast. I suppose meat, for me, is like dessert: I'll eat it but it has to be high quality, and it has to be really worth it. It has to be tremendously delicious, I won't eat meat for meat's sake. This was probably somewhat ethical meat, but it wasn't an irresistible herby or spicy delicious sensation.\n\nThe "thick-cut bacon" that came with the waffle was definitely thick, and was lined with pepper. It was good, but it was also bacon ... bacon SHOULD be good, it's hard to do bad.\n\nI see the trendy hipster appeal everywhere - orange countertops, orange everywhere, down to the stapler on the counter, the 1950's signs that say "Eggs!" and stuff. Whatever. I get it, it's better than Denny's, and it's better than 5 & Diner. It's NOT "The Best" and it's most definitely not worth standing around outside in no shade, without any idea how long the wait will be for a table, like a sucker.\n\nThe chalkboard on the wall inside says "Visit our bar The Roosevelt around the corner." I hadn't known they own the Roosevelt. I recommend going to the Roosevelt and waiting around for a seat there, where it's worth the wait.\n\nI'm glad I finally went, to knock the place off its pedestal. Now I just need to wait like a month or something for my arteries to un-clog.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I am a fan of Guy Fieri and this makes the second restaurant from DDD I have visited. I will be honest and tell you that he co-owns two restaurants in California, one of them being a place called Johnny Garlic's. The food was VERY VERY mediocre so I started to wonder if I should trust his taste in food, but then I said ok he goes to these places because people write to him and tell him they are amazing, not because he has any participation in the restaurant itself. So my mom and I went yesterday (Saturday) morning for breakfast. \n\nWe got there around 9 I think and we had to wait about an hour before we were able to be seated. \n\nWe looked at the menu and were like what the heck this is just basic breakfast food, did we just make a huge mistake? Boy were we wrong. The OJ was great. The coffee on the other hand, eh. I've had a lot better. \n\nI ordered the omelet with provolone and mushrooms and onions and home fries and sourdough bread. \n\nMy mom ordered the eggs with hashbrowns and slice of ham. \n\nThe omelet was huge and gooey with cheese. The mushrooms and onions were cooked to perfection. The home fries were only ok, and that might be because they were a tad cold. The bread is obviously homemade and the jam that came out with it was incredible. \n\nMy moms ham was great. We were not expecting such a big slice and such a thick slice. The taste was amazing as well. \n\nAfter breakfast we walked across the street and went to the farmers market. \n\nI am visiting from California, and should I ever find myself in Phoenix ever again, I will definitely come back and maybe next time try the bacon egg and cheese sandwich. \n\nThe only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the coffee and the limited menu options.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	There are 480 reviews of Matt's Big Breakfast at this time. My guess is that I can't say anything that hasn't been said here or on Food Network. I have wanted to get here for a while, but finally made it in last week with "second wife". She and I are always up for sharing, so we got the cheese omelet with wheat bread and the griddlecakes. Wow.\n\nThe omelet was large and tasty; it went very well with the Tapatio that we both tried (for the first time!). We got the rosemary potatoes on the side and they were delish. The griddlecakes were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, just perfect. Light and airy with a touch of sweetness.\n\nSaving the best for last... the toast. The bread was dark and amazing- full of seeds and whole grains. It came with a little butter, even though we asked for it dry. There was a small side of house-made blueberry preserves that were incredible. I would go back just for the toast and preserves!\n\nWe went on Friday at 1pm, probably a smart move.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Simply the best place in Arizona for breakfast!\n\nMatt's does absolutely everything right.  No freezers in the back, fresh produce from the market, and quality ingredients all the way around shows just how amazing independent restaurants can be.\n\nThe obvious bad about Matt's is the wait.  There are few breakfast places that don't have a wait on Saturday or Sunday morning and Matt's is no exception.  The problem is, however, due to the limited capacity, the wait can become excessive.  I've never waited more than 90 minutes (that was with a group of 5) but when you are hungry, 20 minutes can seem like an hour.  \n\nIf you can occupy yourself with a Kontakt or the Farmers Market long enough to stick around, the rewards are great.  Wonderful, quaint diner setting filled with bright white and orange walls and counters.  An intimate setting where you can be sure you will interact with at least someone else during your meal.  \n\nThe food is great and I have yet to be disappointed.  I usually just order the Special, whatever it may be.  It makes it easier than trying to decide.  The Five Spot is another favorite of mine - egg and cheese breakfast sandwich that is top quality.  The wife always orders the hog and chick (meat and eggs).  The best part of every breakfast is the hashedbrowns that are cooked in butter and better than you've ever had them.\n\nThe workers are sweet and full of personality.  Matt sometimes stops in to drop off milk or eggs or to say Hi to his wife.  She is usually running around making sure everything goes smoothly.  \n\nDo not let the wait deter you.  Go to Matt's.  Take every one of your visiting relatives and friends to Matt's.  Make a special trip from the far east or west valley to go to Matt's.  Just don't do it the day that I go.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I wish I could give 31/2 stars...\n\nFirst of all...just check this place out and decide for yourself- that is if  you don't die of heat stroke while waiting in the 110 degree summer sweatfest that is most notably Phoenix. Or better yet just thank Matt once you make it inside for not bothering to accommodate patrons with some type of effing shading device!!!!! PLANT SOME TREES!!!! UMBRELLAS!!!! OVER HANG! PATIO! A GUY U PAY $3.35/hr WITH A HUGE PIECE OF CARDBOARD! ANYTHING! ok..you get the point. \n(I understand this setup in any other state people, but seriously....!) and btdubs..the outside is just fugly...trees plz!\n\nblah blah blah... once you make it inside everything is great! Simple, basic food, friendly service, quaint atmosphere, decent prices. Yeah you could make it at home, but you can make any breakfast food at home, that is the point of "going out" for breakfast.\n\n*TIP! call ahead and order and then eat while you walk to your car! superkewl time saver DOH!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place came highly recommended.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.\n\nThey have a boring, uninspired menu. Nothing special. The food itself was fine.  It was fresh, and they apparently use all-natural organics.  We had the special Denver scramble. The home fries are chunks of pan-fried potato. Lots of rosemary.  But the flavors just weren't very exciting or bold.\n\nThe strawberry preserves were very good, as was thick cut toast.  Yes, the toast is worth mentioning.  Cut thick, toasted to perfection.  And the bread itself is a really good bread.\n\nI doubt I will return.  If I'm going to go out for breakfast I would choose someplace that features bolder flavors, like The Farmhouse in Gilbert.\n\nMy wife liked it better than I did.  It's really not bad, but if I'm going to go out and pay for a meal I prefer something less pedestrian.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What a simple breakfast menu and yet the food taste nowhere near simple! There was just something about the food that made it one of the best breakfasts I have ever had!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	After all the hype this was an overpriced disappointment. I orderd the griddlecakes with milk and coffee to drink. I also ordered a side of bacon as several reviewers recommended it. Including tax but not tip my total for breakfast was $16.01.  \n\nThe pancakes tasted like Bisquik and the bacon was crispy black and looked and tasted like the cheap grocery store bacon you buy in the shrink-wrap packages. Even funnier the "three pieces" were actuallly only 1/2 pieces of bacon at around 4" long. Overall I've had much better breakfasts at The Good Egg and First Watch at a lower price. \n\nAnother disappointment was waiting for me in the parking lot. An employee had parked her white Volvo behind my car and blocked me in. I first waited for her to finish unloading the car, assuming she would move the car after she was done. Instead she came out once more, closed the the trunk and went back inside. I had to go back inside and ask her to move.  The employee did finally move her car but she didn't bother to apologize.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's Big Breakfast is a wonderful place in the morning to feel the life of downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten there 5 times in the last year and each meal was worth the 10 to 20 minute wait out side on the sidewalk.  \n\nAt 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, July 3, my wife Marie and I ventured downtown and decided to have breakfast out.  Matt's was on our mind.  We waited outside only 5 minutes before getting a table by the window next to the kitchen entry.  Busy place, but the service was great.  Quick with the coffee for Marie and ice tea for me.  Marie ordered an omelet with cheese and mushrooms, while I decided on the special, eggs benedict.  We both had the home fries. \n\nWhen everything arrived, the meal was very yummy.  Marie, in her delicate way, snarfed down her omelet with a smile.  My eggs benedict was on a fresh English muffin, topped with ham, poached eggs, and a yummy hollandaise sauce.  Calories be damned!\n\nThe whole meal cost $22.53 + 4.00 tip.\n\nYes the place is small and you'll most likely have a short wait for a table, but get over that, because the experience of eating good food prepared by great people is worth your time.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Small cozy joint.... great coffee... friendly servers....simple menu. \nAnother Triple D find worth going to...... I am finding Guy F. loves Arizona... after spending a week here I can see why.. tons of good eats super little time! Got here after the business people but before the slacker crowd (back home that means somewhere between 8:30 and 9 AM). So we had no wait....\n\nI got the five spot which totally kept me full for hours...that and the three cups of local coffee... The peppery bacon this joint uses is to die for...My five spot: The sweet onions, the bun, the bacon and the perfectly cooked eggs.... solid breakfast. I had a taste of Julie K's griddlecakes and they were yummy. \n\nI appreciate simplicity and this place has some basics on the menu but do them well. Reasonably priced menu... I highly recommend :-).\n\nFew things\n1. BRING QUARTERS ....  lots of places to park but it is metered parking\n2. come early and make sure EVERYONE in your party is there\n3. Bathroom is next door (TALK TO MIKEY.. he is a very wise and amazing person)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This little place was great for breakfast.  Service was great and the food better.  It was paced and the just keep the coffee coming.  Was worth the wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Very much appreciate the new space with bathrooms and room to move. And also happy that the food quality was not impacted the slightest. The wait makes it all the better. And that strawberry lemonade?! Whoo, tasty. Just lighten up on the ice! But for those who are looking for veggie options, they have a lil' bit, particularly the standard omelet with cheese. Would like to see a bit more variety without the meat. Otherwise great work.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My family and I parked our asses at the breakfast bar after a 45 minute wait.  And had a perfect breakfast.\n\nErnie was delightful to chat with, but more importantly, the breakfasts were spot on.  Great cakes, great scramble, amazing chunky breakfast potatoes, and am I imagining it or did I get served a bloody mary?  Hey, a guy can dream.  :)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I don't even know what the hell I had because it was soooo dang good that I ate it all and went into a food-itis coma instantly.  Nah just kidding about the memory but totally serious about the food coma.  We checked this place out on an off day and it was still pretty populated.  Breakfast anytime CAN NOT BEAT THAT!!!  My bro and I got the the same platter which was the special of the day.  Linguisa with sourdough toast, hash browns, home fries, eggs, homemade preserves!!!  Everything was SPECTACULAR!  Like seriously!!!  It was a very homey and neighborhood feel to the restaurant with super excellent service.  Ninja water and coffee refills, great timing and check ups!  I think that it was part of our server as well but she was magnificent as well.  The overall experience was really enjoyable and I'll definately be back!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ok. parking here totally sucks. luckily, we ate here early in the day, and people were leaving, so we waited a bit and took their spot. (when going downtown, carpool, people!) we were promptly seated, and just in time, as a bunch of people came in 5 minutes later, and had to wait outside. \n\ni had the daily special of chorizo with eggs and jalapenos, my bf had the sausage and eggs combo (forgot its actual name). i personally don't really care for rosemary, but if you like it, the potatoes will rock your socks off. we were both stuffffffed. the food was incredibly hot, fresh and delish (and spicy!). service was fast... so we were happy. until we thought about how much butter we were consuming. but bc it was so yummy, that we decided we didn't care. \n\n the homemade toast and preserves were also pretty killer. even though i was stuffed to the brim, i ended up eating my bf's last piece of toast and preserves as we walked out. they were that good.\n\ni just wish there were more menu options...
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Great cup of coffee, best waffle I've ever had, got there just in time to beat (most of) the breakfast rush. My husband got a steak & eggs special. I loved that their water glasses are recycled jelly jars, coincidentally the kind we purchase and now we will be using at home. I can't wait to go back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Stopped in Saturday morning, early enough to beat the crowds. (After 7.30ish, fuggetabouit....). Ordered Hog (sausage patties) and Chick, but really didn't want hashbrowns. No subs tough, so got a single pancake side. Sadly, I must say it was only an average breakfast. Eggs OM as requested, and sausage good, but almost too spicy, overpowering the pork. The hashbrowns are a waste though, like an afterthought to fill the plate. Almost burned, raw in the middle. Easy enough issue to fix though. Matt should bump up the quality control to keep the place hoppin'. No big worries though, I'll be comin' back!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place has horrible customer service. I had been wanting to try this place for some time. Put my name on the list up front, checked it three times. The third time my name was scratched off. In this hour of waiting I hadn't even been acknowledged. I love small places like this and don't mind waiting, but I would rather drive to Tucson and wait for a table at Franks or BoBos than go back and try this place again. No food is good enough for an hour+ wait and to be forgotten. Again, don't bother.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We heard about this from a friend and when I did a google search to find it I came across a video clip from "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives" on Youtube. They made it look yummy so I took my hubby there one weekday morning last week. The parking lot was full and there were about 6 people waiting outside. Take a timetravel trip back to the 40's or 50's...there is an old motel and attached to it is this little, TINY diner. You walk up to the door and add your own name and # in party to the paper on the cart by the front door. Find a seat on a bench, if you can. Oh, if you have to park on the street because the lot is full bring some quarters because the spaces are metered.\n\nWe waited about 15-20 minutes. When you go in there is a counter and tables for two around the outside wall. There is at least 1 table for 4 in the back.\n\nI wanted to go here because they claim that they use all fresh ingredients "No freezer or microwave" and they use organic when possible. I saw the eggs being delivered and they were regular, not organic. When we were seated the waitress was right there to take our order. Since it was the first time we had been there we were a little slow, felt pressured because they want to turn the tables in this 7 top restaurant.\n\nMy hubby and I both ordered the "local, organic apple cider" at $3.95 per glass. It was an 8 oz glass so I felt that was steep! He ordered the bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast. The eggs were perfect, the bacon was limp- he asked for extra crisp, but it tasted good. The hash browns were a very large serving and crisp on the outside but very creamy, mushy on the inside, tasted good. The bread was homemade, 2 thick slices of cranberry walnut and he enjoyed it.  I ordered the waffle. It was a waffle, sprinkled with powdered sugar- which I can't stand and served with warm maple syrup. It came with 2 large slices of pepper bacon. It was all good, but with all the hype I was expecting more. \n\nI saw a woman at the counter eating what I thought was eggs benedict so I asked the waitress. She said it was but that they had just run out! Boo hoo! I would have really enjoyed that! She said it is their special every Thursday and to come back. Now, I checked the website before we went and did not see this special or any others. If it is a weekly special I don't understand why it isn't on the website so people know. \n\nI had to visit the ladies room. Now I have been to some out of the way places but this was really odd! You have to go out of the restaurant, into the hotel next door, wander down the hall...you can hear a tv, there is a no vacancy sign. There is a small sign for "Matt's customers", turn right (into a room) the restroom is a unisex bathroom in a hotel room. There is no waste basket for ladies and the hand towel is a real towel on the bar. It was vintage and clean but using the same towel as everyone else is NOT sanitary.\n\nI would go again if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Great breakfast spot in Phoenix! Hash browns were incredibly buttery and creamy, the special 3 meat scramble w/pepperjack cheese was excellent, and the kids liked the pancakes.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#mOrO9Ye3lyhOiv-mD-K_JQ\n\nThey recently moved to a new location at 1st St/Garfield since being featured on DDD. Look for this mural as you go down 1st St.:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#6zWWyXZVsPp83YplKgGr5g\n\nCozy little place has 12 tables and a breakfast bar section to hold maybe 50(?) people in there. Apparently it's no secret because we attempted to go at 9:00a on a Saturday morning. WHOA. 1hr+ wait. \n\nWe tried again at 1:30pm the same day and there was no line. So if you can't get there at 6:30am when they open, I would recommend going after the lunch crowd dies down, before they close at 2:30p. Look at how empty it gets:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#l4u6G9p-5Jzlbw7oS2kCjA\n\nAt that time you can order off the breakfast OR lunch menu, if they haven't sold out of everything by then.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We went around 8 am on a Thursday, and we had immediate seating. The coffee was amazing. We had the eggs benedict, which were quite good and the hashbrowns were extremely crisp. I had the waffles which melted in my mouth. The batter was not salty but sweet. We were really impressed. Matt's has a tiny parking lot next to the building but parking can be a problem.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Absolutely delicious, fresh food. Wonderful, friendly, on the ball staff.\n\nMy wishes for this place are:\n \nThey would put an awning and some misters outside for while you are enduring the long wait. The sun was beating down on us and we almost left as we had our 6 year old....it was getting to be a bit much. Easily rectified with some more shade and misters. I'm guessing they don't bother as they get enough business even without them.\n\nAs vegetarians, when we get something without meat, and don't sub it for something else, I always wish the price would be adjusted slightly. Wishful thinking in most places, I know.\n\nOpen something in Laveen Matt. :)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	It's tempting to suggest, "an egg is just an egg". You hear that kind of thing a lot, and admittedly, there have been plenty of "legendary" breakfast places that have made me feel just that. Matt's Big Breakfast is not one of them.\n\nWhat makes MBB unique is the quality of the food and the quality of the ingredients they use to make it. True, there menu is small, and when you read it, nothing particular will jump out at you , but that doesn't mean there's nothing special on it. For instace, everybody serves hashbrowns but these are without a doubt THE BEST hashbrowns I have ever had. The omlettes and eggs are great too. \n\nNo doubt, Matt's serves five-star food. It only loses a star because it's a little pricey and the wait is usually waaay too long. Maybe I shouldn't hold that against them, but I do...so get over it. \n\nAlso, their lunch is just average, and of course, they close far too early.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Because of all of the other yelpers describing the long waits, my partner and I decided to try Matt's on a Wednesday, mid morning.  We waited about 10 minutes before being seated.  I enjoyed the unpretentious atmosphere of Matt's Big Breakfast.  The service was excellent.  When I say excellent, I mean our waitress took our drink orders immediately, answered our questions expertly, and brought our meals exactly as ordered (which is impressive because I can be a tad high maintenance).  Our food was pipping hot and very tasty.  I had the cheddar omelette and added mushrooms and onions. I ordered home fries (roasted potatoes with rosemary and onions) and fresh squeezed orange juice.  The orange juice was just the right size, and not too sweet.  The omelette was chock full of mushrooms, onions and cheddar.  The potatoes were golden brown and delicious with a little extra salt.  My partner ordered the griddle cakes which she said were soft, buttery and with the real maple syrup, yummy.  While Matt's is pretty small, I think there's plenty of room to enjoy a great meal!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Its been a while since the hubs and I had been to Matt's. \n\nWe woke up on New Years Eve and I knew Matt's had to be our last breakfast of the year. \n\nWe got there at about 930 and were 5th in line! Wooooot! \n\nThe hubs and I grabbed a spot on one of the benches and had fun watching all the newbs come up. They always walk right past all the people standing outside waiting, past the sign in page and march inside like they own the place. soooo funny. \n\nThe food and service is still as great as its ever been! The waffle was sent from heaven and so was the bacon! \n\nEven though our visits have become few and far between due to moving further away, Ernie still knows who we are and keeps teasing us and asking when we are going to have kids, she is like a distant aunt! Love her! \n\nKeep it up Matts!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The fam and I were hitting some DDD spots last week in Phoenix while we were out there from LA, and we had to hit Matts.\n\nI've actually thought a lot about this place since, and I have to say I dig it.  It has a serious funky factor - it's tiny, loud and the servers are friendly and outgoing.\n\nAs for the food, the pancakes were rock star - absolutely delicious.  If I was on death row getting my last meal, those cakes would send me to the great beyond in peace.\n\nOther foods were good, and I don't get the deal with everyone saying the coffee is crappy - it's better than chain restaurants, so I don't know what the problem is.\n\nThere is one thing that's keeping me from giving it 5 start.  While we were there, about 5 minutes after we ordered, the power went out on the whole block.  To their credit, they finished our order, but the place heated up and filled with smoke from the grill (the fans weren't working), and by the end of the meal we couldn't see the back of the restaurant from the smoke.\n\nThat's fine and all, but someone called Matt and he came down and was stomping back and forth through the restaurant - walking around outside, back in, back outside.  The place was full, and it would have been appropriate for him, as the proprietor to talk to the customers, let us know what's going on - he didn't do anything, and we were all just staring at each other and him.  It was a weird scene - he could have set everyone at ease, and at least poured everyone some free iced tea, but there was nada.\n\nPower failures aside, the place is the bomb, and just what a breakfast place should be.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Food was good.  Greasy but good.\n\nThe price of the small glass of fresh sqeezed orange juice was silly expensive but it was tasty.\n\nI had an omelet with sauteed mushrooms and onions and cheddar cheese with wheat toast and preserves as well as home fries.\n\nI would eat here again if there was no wait and I was in the area.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's Big Breakfast is a place that I try to get to multiple times a month.  To put it simply... it is amazing.  I am not a big breakfast person, but I would gladly make time to get over there for some food when I can.  The Eggs Benedict and most of the specials are great!  I typically choose hash browns over home fries, as the hash browns are a little lighter, but both are quite tasty.  Most people overlook the lunch items on the menu, they are just as good as the breakfast items.  The pesto chicken sandwich and the big butter burger are quite delicious.\n\nWhat else to say... The staff is very friendly and attentive. I have never had a bad experience there and it is well worth the wait if you have the time.\n\nOh and do yourself a favor... make sure to get some Bacon (unless you don't eat bacon).
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	When people say Matt's is small, they're right.  I think there are maybe 8 tables and some stools up at the bar and that's about it.   Also, don't expect to walk right in & grab a seat.  Popular spot + tiny place = waiting (we waited about 45 minutes for a table for 2).  Thankfully, it was a pretty nice day, though there isn't a whole heckuva lot to explore in the area.\n\nPlusses:  \n-They serve RC cola!  Fun times.  I haven't had an RC since I was a kid.\n-Their waffle is really good.   Light, sweet, buttery deliciousness.  \n-Small place = intimate setting.  It's a good place for conversation, at least in a small group setting.\n\nMinuses: \n-The place, and my silverware, weren't especially clean.  Having a knife that's gunky doesn't make me want to eat.\n-The bacon was underdone.  I like chewy bacon, but mine was almost oinking.  I'll take a steak medium-rare, but please not the bacon.\n-The aforementioned RC cola gets served to you in can form. \n\nAll-in-all, the food was pretty good, but not a place I'd wait outside for 45 minutes for.  \n\n3.5 stars.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Always good, Always a smile! \n\nA" must-go" if you are anywhere in AZ ...! \n... get to Matt's and you can thank me later! ;) \n\nA HINT: get there a little before 6am or bring an umbrella for the sun in case you have a wait. \n\nRegardless ... wake early, travel with an umbrella or sunscreen OR sit for a bit ... you will be glad you "close this deal!" \n\nBfast or Lunch ... the answer is YES!\n\nBon Appetit!\n\n- Britten
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	If I had to wait for Matt's, I don't think I would like it so much. I mean, it's good, but it's not "I will wait an hour in the Phoenix summer" good.\n\nFortunately, I've live across the street from Matt's and discovered they have takeout! There is nothing better than walking out with my takeout while people who have been waiting for an hour enviously stare.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Not as long a wait as I was expecting.  Great service and the Griddle cakes were great. I would definitely came back, when I'm in town.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Awesome food and worth the wait.  My sis and I showed up at 10 am on a Wednesday morning.  Had to wait about 5 min.  All waitresses care about everyone and not just their own table.  Sis had the chop n chik.. I had the special...  Some sort of vienna Guada sausage scramblers with cheese....  AHhh-- mazingly good!!!   Juice, preserves, and milk all taste super fresh.  Some of the best hashbrowns I have ever tasted.  Have the perfect crispyness but yet the right texture in the middle.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place has received a lot of hype, so be prepared to wait.\nand wait.\nand wait.\n\nTo make the trip more enjoyable:\n- don't actually come hungry (or risk passing out in the lot from low-blood sugar)\n- show up at least hour earlier than you want to be seated then get on list\n- go hang out  at the farmers market across street while you wait\n- expect solid (but not mind blowing) food\n\nGo for the experience at least once, then find another breakfast spot.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Checked-in and asked for a cup of coffee. Woman at register was a complete bi!$& and was completely disgruntled and on a huge power trip.  I had to purchase a coffee to go and she threw my card onto the counter.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We were heading towards Scottsdale from Peoria and wanted a great breakfast place.  This breakfast did not disappoint!  We had to wait about 45 min. due to all the Oregon and Auburn fans in town, but well worth the wait anyway.  I had the pancakes and they were the best I have had served up in a restaurant.  My husband had the eggs, hash browns (crispy and buttery), toast with home made strawberry jam (like freezer jam my mom use to make with strawberries from our garden) and thick peppery bacon that you could smell cooking while waiting outside.  Next time I think I might ask for the jam and spread it on the pancakes.  Very limited menu, but like a lot of people say pick a few things and make them very good.  This is exactly what they have done there.  \nYou might even have a chance to meet the owner of the building and the Hotel Coronado next door, he mingles in the crowd and likes to strike up conversations with anyone.\nWe have had many people recommend different restaurants to us and they don't always live up to the hype, however this place was above and beyond what we expected.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I've been hearing good things about this place for so long, it was ridiculous I hadn't yet been. I'm all about supporting local business & breakfast is my favorite meal, so this past Saturday I decided to check it off my foodie bucket list. I met 2 friends at 10am. One of them had gotten there at 945 and put our name on the list for a table of 3. Almost 1 hour later, we were seated at a 2 top with an additional chair pulled up. To start, a hipster waitress wearing a huge gold watch and too many bracelets asked what we wanted to order after we had been seated for no more than 2 minutes. Menu-  I've been craving French toast all morning. Come to find they don't have French toast. "French toast is seasonal". Really? Waitress is back again asking what we want after an additional 2 minutes. I ordered a waffle that came with 2 pieces of bacon for $7.50. Waffle was good, served with real cream butter. They do have real maple syrup which is a plus. The bacon was thick, but peppered on the sides which I don't like. Maybe I'm greedy but I also think they should have given 3 slices for a $7.50 plate. I also ordered a cup of coffee (which admittedly I am a coffee snob). Ick.  Burned and watered down at the same time. Needing the extra caffeine, I got my coffee refilled once the cup had been empty for almost 15 mins. I actually asked a server passing by twice if they could refill it.  They never did bring the creamer I asked for (also twice) so I couldn't even drink the 2nd cup. All in all, we waited entirely too long for a crowded place whose food was nothing to write home about. Our bill was almost $50 including tip for 3 people. I recommend you skip this hipster spot that has been hyped up entirely too much. Simply doesn't meet up to expectations IMO. If I'm craving a hipster breakfast and am prepared to shell out $50 for 3 people, I will swing by Postino's for brunch on Saturday/Sunday and get a meal with fresher ingredients and much better coffee and service. Likely a shorter wait, too.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Bright and early, there I was standing in line, waiting to get into Matt's Big Breakfast.  The wait was tolerable, perhaps because it was still early (roughly 8AM).  Although, this tiny restaurant only provides limited number of seating; they were well-managed and promptly operated.  In addition, the waiter was friendly and the service was just flawless.  It didn't just take the restaurant's staff members to provide customers' smooth dining experiences; the customers also knew the etiquette.  They get in, eat, and get out, making the wait bearable.\n\nLike the name of the restaurant, the portions of our breakfast were extremely satisfying.  The extra plus Matt's deserves is the reasonable pricing that is particularly easy on your wallet.  Both their breakfast and lunch menu items range from $4 to $8 - incredibly affordable.\n\nI ordered the five spots with home fries.  As the dish was placed in front of me, the smell of fresh rosemary had swiftly increased my appetite.  The home fries were buttery, perfectly cooked, and well-seasoned.  The eggs weren't as fluffy as I'd like, but overall the pros definitely exceed the cons.\n\nI'd definitely stop by whenever I happen to be in town.  Bottom-line, good food, good service, and affordable prices, who wouldn't be a fan?
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Best waffle I have ever had, and the five spot ain't bad either. Food is a bit greasy, and I recommend going on a weekday.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	There and back again..\n\nWe ventured this morning to a great land called Phoenix (though today we shall call that Gondor) from our little Scottsdale burrow (we shall call that the Shire). The Shire has many wonderful things to offer so we don't venture to far. \n\nThere's been talk of a movement in the great land of Gondor.. this movement is called Slow Food. Were great humans feed others based on sustainable crops, dairy and meat. These humans try to whenever possible, use only locally grown ingredients. There was word of an outdoor market that believes in these philosophies and shares with all the locals there. So off to Gondor.  \n\nAfter an easy and painless journey we arrived at the great outdoor market to find that it wasn't open yet. A very small distance east of there were a few humans mulling around a classic Gondor building that looked to have been turned into some sort of eatery. Once inside we discovered a great man named Matt and his magical Big Breakfast! We were seated at a counter with many other hungry travelers. \n\nA fair maiden appeared.. she was so friendly and welcoming.. then took our orders.. the great man Matt had created something just for that day.. Salsa Verde Huevos Rancheros. The way the maiden pronounced these words we though for a moment she was speaking Elven.. only moments had passed and then set before us were 2 huge plates filled with roasted potatoes, 2 eggs over easy atop a corn tortilla covered in a green sauce. You see hobbits love good food, you can tell by their round bellies and lack of defined abs.. this was indeed a bountiful feast!  The fragrance arose from the plate and filled our nostrils.. we both stared into each others eyes then quickly began eating.. the flavors and textures were simply heavenly.. each better then the last! \n\nWe could see ourselves making the journey to Gondor quite often from the Shire.. we could see someday perhaps living in Gondor close to the outdoor market and of course the great Matt's Big Breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I love this place!  its so small but so cute at the same time. I think nearly everything is homemade which is great! their homemade strawberry jam is delicious!! They have the best pancakes! No syrup needed!  You MUSt get the hashbrowns!! everything tastes so fresh and flavorful. Its one of my favorite breakfast joints. The only reason they didn't get 5 stars from me is because the staff is kind of ALL OVER THE PLACE which tends to get a little annoying. Other than that, no complaints! Go here and BON APETITE!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What more can be said. Amazing food. Right next to the Farmer's Market on Saturday's. Friendly staff especially the ownwer's wife who noticed that we were new on our first visit and went out of her way to welcome us. The pancakes? Wow! 'Nough said....
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	so the quest is finally over.\n\ni have found my hangover breakfast spot.\n\nalthough not hungover on this occasion, i believe that matt's will fit the bill for my greasy big breakfast need after a long night.\n\ncame in around 11am, because i can never seem to make it up before 10, and there was no wait and we were greeted and seated right away. started with a coffee which was SO good, some of the best diner/breakfast coffee i have ever had. i went with the salami and egg scramble with hashbrowns and sourdough toast, and my friend went with the chick and hog with bacon and home fries. the food came up pretty fast and i dug in.\n\nfantastic.\n\nthe eggs were cooked perfectly and the salami was out of this world. the hashbrowns were a little greasy but i mixed everything together and it balanced out. a little tabasco sauce, and i had one bomb breakfast. i tried my friends bacon and it was phenomenal. crispy, thick, and peppery. delicious. their oj is like drinking straight out of an orange. the toast was great, and their jam was just the right amount of sweet. their portions are HUGE, i couldn't even finish my breakfast. my friend was as impressed as i was. it wasn't overwhelming loud inside like some small joints are known to be (like over easy...) and it wasn't crammed at all, even though the place looks incredibly tiny from the outside!\n\nexcellent service, stellar food, cool atmosphere, all for only $20 plus tip. i'm jumping on the matt's bandwagon.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	i can never remember if i like the hash browns or home fries. it's the home fries, definitely. portions are super huge. i don't go here nearly enough, but maybe that's a good thing. breakfast is too delicious for words.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	It's about time that people be a lot more honest in their reviews of Matt's Big Breakfast.\nThis place is over hyped in every sense, and mainly - still - because of its faux-trendy/hip atmosphere...  that was cute five or so years back.\nThough, what matters is the food and maybe the surroundings of a place, right?\n\nWell, the servings are hearty (pack an extra artery), and the home fried potatoes are tasty.\n\nThat's about it.\nEnd of review.\n\nNo... got to be a little more honest here.\n\nThe rest of the menu is mediocre at best, and hardly worth an hours' wait in line and/or just to be seated, nor enough to chew on or pay for.  The first or second time might be cool, you may enjoy it.  But the third time there you'll be honest to admit that there's far better elsewhere.\nAs surroundings go, the place is like a muggy gym locker room but smaller in size, and so poorly ventilated that you'll think that the proprietor's must think nothing of sitting in the humidity upon a toilet of a rest stop in Austin, TX with their plate of food on their knees.\nMe thinks that anyone with a few simple squares of aluminum foil and heat could cook any of Matt's menu items within their own kitchen and very likely do better within 20 minutes flat, easy.\n\nI don't mean to sound harsh or scathing, but after hearing so many sheep over hyping this place time after time you realize it's all fake kissy-kiss talk.  "Phooey!", I say.\n\nThe most important thing you must know and take from this - regardless of whether anything I'm saying here is something you agree with or not - is to beware of the... ehm... "coffee".  Sincerely.  I've heard many others state that you must be an incredibly gracious customer to take a sip.  Merely a whiff of its bouquet brings to mind a vinaigrette of acrid rags and dank wool socks.  Most folks count on having a great cup of coffee with their breakfast; a great cup of coffee is obviously required in conjunction with breakfast.  Like the necessary combinations of two things: Sun & Moon, peanut butter & honey, soap & water, doesn't everyone have a knowing that if you're going to serve coffee during breakfast it needs to taste like coffee?  Even if it's the most watered down brew it needs to taste something LIKE coffee.  Apparently Matt's will hear none of that; they don't seem to be aware nor have heard the talk that some folks don't return just because their coffee resembles what Grandpappy brewed up in a drop-pan a week ago ON TOP OF the coffee grounds that he brewed a month ago, then filtered through newspaper taken from the doghouse outside and used a second time to line the bottom of a bird cage.  (Shwew!)  In fact, I can count two separate occasions when I had actually overheard a server apologize to customers who'd commented on their putrid brew.  Utterly disgusting.\n\nThe servers and cooks are nice, friendly and personable (I'm talking - genuinely enjoy what they do) and that, admittedly, counts for a whole lot.\nNonetheless, give Matt's a try at least once.\nAt least.\nBut, pass on the coffee... or, "Don't go into the light!" as they say of near death experiences.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Service here is great.  Despite how busy it gets, the food came promptly and the wait was bearable (though 30-40 minutes on a Sunday morning can be hard for those running short on time!).  It's funny how you can smell bacon/greasy meat before you even walk in!  I eventually got accustomed to it.  I didn't get to try the waffles, but their hash browns were soo good!  I will definitely come back again if I'm in Phoenix again.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I am new to the Phoenix area and was in the mood for someone else to cook my breakfast for a change and stumbled across all these rave reviews of Matt's on yelp. Normally I find that the yelp reviews are just about spot on and very honest. This is my first case of the contrary. I don't know what hole in the wall "amazing" breakfast joint these reviews were for, but I must have been at the wrong place.........\n\nDon't get me wrong this place is reasonably priced for your basic breakfast, but that is about it. I gave them an extra star for using "local" ingredients. This place is below Waffle House and the like on my list. \n\nThe hash browns were more like a chopped potato omelet that needed a few more minuets, I.E. raw mashed potato in the middle. They take "over easy" a little too serious also. If there were such a thing as egg tar tar, that's what was on my plate. If you have ever had eggs like this, the ones that can't even be eaten with a fork, then you know my pain. I will say my pork chop was good, but who can screw up a pork chop? The bread was good, nice thick cut slices of what looked to be locally baked loafs. The preserve that came with said toast was okay too, but it got snatched away before I could finish. \n\nAll in all, this place is good for the sheep that need to eat downtown, but lacks anything for a reason to return or recommend it to anyone. If you are in the area and thinking of eating here, try somewhere else. I didn't have to wait in line like many on yelp have stated, and I'm sure glad I didn't for that lack of quality. There are many other options in the area, give someone else a shot that's not banking on you eating there because they were on T.V.................
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Googled best breakfast in Phoenix and this place  popped up, saw Guy F's review from April this year and it was good so we gave it a try this morning. It is easy to miss because it is so small. It had awesome service, was very fresh and tasty but disappointed because they only have RC Cola ( no refills) and not a huge menu but overall it was good. The special was awesome with home fries, around $8, my son got the waffle ( only get 1) with 2 bacon for around 8-9$ and my husband got 3 pancakes for about 9$ as well. You only get a small amount of syrup so an extra side is $1.50 ( too pricy for 3 pancakes). Bill was $28.00 and I think too much for what we got. The food was good, had to give it a try. Would never wait for more then a few minutes to eat there.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Get the Hog and the Chick! No wait... The Chop and the chick...NOOO, get the special! Ok. Just get it all!! Thick cut bacon, fresh squeezed orange juice, crispy has browns, fresh preserves on sourdough toast.  Oh man, is this place good. Yes, you might have to wait a while to get seated in this TINY place, but it is worth it! \n\nThe service is very friendly and very quick.  I enjoy sitting along the window with their cute little knick knacks.  \n\nI hear the lunch menu is just as good at breakfast, but I have yet to try.  I honestly wish this place was open for dinner..."brinner" is my favorite meal! ;-)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	After driving from Lake Havasu to Phoenix, the bf and I were ravenous and wanted something big and breakfast-y.  Matt's Big Breakfast was the natural choice, and we didn't regret it, not one bit!\n\nWe arrived at 2pm, and the place closes at 2:30, according to the sign on the door.  Luckily, they let us eat.  I got the waffle and eggs ($6).  The waffle was possibly the best I'd ever had - big squares of Belgian waffle fluffiness.  The eggs, scrambled, were organic, and they made sure we knew it.  I appreciated this very much because I live in organic capital of the world.  Also on the side was a delicious, fresh thick-cut of bacon, perfectly peppered.\n\nThe bf had the salami scramble ($6.50), equally delicious, with authentic, not-out-of-the-bag salami.  These were thick chunks, and tasted wonderful in the softly scrambled eggs.\n\nIf I'm ever in this neck of the woods again, I'll be sure to stop by Matt's. Overall, a delicious breakfast experience for a steal!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Since we were on vacation and Guy Fiere had suggested a breakfast place my wife agreed to go to Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix. This place may have converted my wife to becoming a breakfast liker.\n\nThough there menu below is kinda of lite on options. Nine breakfast items and if your there after 11am you can choose from another nine lunch items. If it wasn't for Guy Fiere featuring them on them twice on the Food Network we would have skipped this place. How could any of these common breakfast items be so good to wait in line for about forty-five minutes.\n\nOverall the restaurant can hold maybe about fifty people. I wouldn't suggest this place if you had a party of more then four. They really don't have room to combine a whole lot of tables. Also they don't quote wait times be scared, be very scared or bring a newspaper or your phone with a 2 person game like we did. We like playing Connect 4 it's an easy game but both of us are pretty competitive, so time passes fast. \n\nWe got seated at the bar, the service was prompt. We ordered coffee's, Griddle Cakes and The Chop and Chicks. Took under fifteen minutes to get our food out. The food was hot and smelled amazing.\n\nAccording to my wife these are the best pancakes the ever! She almost couldn't put the fork down. They were really light, sweet and fluffy pancakes. It was served with a nice dollop of butter and warm maple syrup.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	After all the raving I have heard about Matt's Big Breakfast and the long wait I was so excited to enjoy my food. The quality of the ingredients were high; however, the service was not so great. I felt that the waitresses were attempting to rush us out of the restaurant. I realize that it is a busy place, but their overt pushiness was not warranted. \n\nOverall I would not go back again. The food was made with great ingrediants, but it just didn't "do it " for me.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I LOVE this place and if I lived closer I would come here every day. I've had breakfast twice here with my boyfriend. I so want to branch out my order but both times I ordered the Hog and Chick with bacon and hashbrowns. Thick-cut, delicious peppered bacon and crispy on top, soft in the middle hashbrowns, what more could you want? The thick slices of toast with jam are a really nice touch and the honey lemonade is to die for. My boyfriend always gets the Five Spot breakfast sandwich that has eggs, bacon, onions and cheese on a fresh roll. De-lish! Next time we go I plan on trying the pancakes, I always eye them enviously when I'm there.\n\nWhen you get there, simply put your name on the list and the number in your party. The pad is usually on top of the water cooler by the door. Then grab a seat in the shade if you can find one and wait anxiously for your name to be called. Don't let the wait detour you, it's completely worth it. Now that it's cooling down the wait won't be so unbearable, especially if you're like me and want your weekend brunch around 1. (I've waited about 30 mins on average)\n\nThe restaurant is small and there are only a few tables but it doesn't feel crowded. The staff is super friendly and quick with your orders. You can usually hear some good tunes coming out of the kitchen. The prices are beyond reasonable for the quality of food that you get.\n\nYou will leave full, happy and extremely satisfied.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	As far as the food goes it is absolutely delicious. I had the special which was a 3 egg scramble with asparagus, top sirloin steak and fontina cheese and it was very tasty. One thing I really like about this place is that they have fresh squeezed orange juice. I love fresh squeezed orange juice and it is rare to find it in restaurants these days - or at least at the ones I have been going to :)\n\nThe glass of orange juice was awesome but it was tiny. There is also always a long wait here since the restaurant is very small and cannot accommodate very many people.\n\nI am deducting one star for the wait and the portions of orange juice, but the food was delicious - my wife and I ate every bite.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We'd always wanted to try this place out, especially after it gained fame on The Travel Channel. It's a literal hole in the wall in downtown Phoenix that's known for fabulous breakfast and endless waits. \n\n"Matt's Big Breakfast on N. First St. is a popular diner that serves heaping plates of Chop and Chick (pork chops and eggs). A local favorite, the small dining room fills up fast causing a line of early birds to pour out onto the street." - the Travel Channel\n\nEverything about this place could be described as, well, cute. The yellow door, tiny juice glasses with roosters on them, vintage art on the walls, even the waitress aprons. \n\nMy bf ordered the special; a concoction of eggs, hashbrowns and Andouille sausage in a hearty sauce. I opted for the waffle that came with A. the best butter I've ever had and B. some bacon. \n\nThe service was lightening fast once we were seated and the food was tasty. My waffle was by far the winner of our two entrees.\n\nWould I wait an hour to eat here again? Doubtful. Am I glad I got to experience it? Very.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Really good breakfast. The waffle was probably as good as I've had at a restaurant and the quality of the food was really good. I'd recommend stopping in, but as for now and where my travels have taken me it didn't dethrone Ruth's Diner in Salt Lake as my favorite breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I've been a regular here the past 3 years. Other than the wait being long, the five spot sandwhich and waffle make this place one of my favorite in the nation.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This was the aboslute BEST breakfast I have ever had. Every single ingredient is so fresh and tasty. I ordered a cheese omlet with a side of pancakes. My sis and I shared it. We also got orange juice and coffee. We were in heaven! We did not have 1 single complaint. From the service to cleanliness to the food it was a 10!! If you are looking for a delicious breakfast experience THIS IS THE PLACE!! \n\nI plan on going back asap!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We just landed from kc, we were hungry and wet from the rain.  A 20 minute wait and a good table, my birthday got brighter.  The bacon was extra crispy and the orange juice had bits of real orange.  Service was quick and organized.  The place is small, but clean & bright.  If you are ever there when they have the three meat scramble with eggs, spicy peppers & cheese- get it!  My partner ordered this & I had food envy.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	OK, every time I got to Matt's, I tell myself that is the last time I will got there. I hate the long wait. And I hate the feeling of being rushed through my weekend breakfast because they are more interested in turning over tables than me having a good dining experience.\n\nBut the food keeps me coming back. It is consistently good. They always prepare my food exactly how I request it. And I never leave a crumb to waste, which isn't usually the case.\n\nSa, as much as I hate to say it, Matt's is worth the wait. And I'll be back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I went by myself and waited an hour and a half on a Thursday morning. The hostess was rude, after a mix up when she called me (the name she called before me didn't come so she went to seat me, but then realized that she said the name wrong so I waited ten more minutes and then she called tables who were after me), she told me "oh there's a table inside in the corner you can go now". I felt super rushed and that I was inconveniencing the restaurant. The waiter I had seemed not all there. The food was ok but definitely not worth the hype and price.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I've been to Matt's a couple of times now.  There is always a line.  Most recently I went on a Wednesday, which they will tell you is the slowest day,  and the line was shorter that day.\n\nMatt's is small, not in a quaint way, but in a cramped way.  I sat at the counter.  It's impossible to sit comfortably at their counter, because of the lack of leg room, but the other problem is that  they have put one too many chairs at the counter, so I was bumping elbows throughout my meal with my neighbors.  If you go by yourself, they won't let you sit at a table, so you're stuck at their crappy counter.  (don't get me wrong...I normally love to sit at the counter at a restaurant, as you get better and faster service)\n\nOne of my meals, the AZ scramble (a special) was pretty solid.  And I like the rosemary homefries.  Other meals (including the salami and eggs) weren't that remarkable.\n\nMatt's won't be my first, second, third choice for breakfast in the valley.  Too much trouble for inconsistent results.  If I want to wait in a line I'll go to Morning Glory Cafe, where the atmosphere is SO much better and the food is better.  If I don't want to wait in a line, there are many other breakfast places that offer good consistent food without a wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I went here with a friend after he saw it recommended by Guy Fieri on the food network. It's a true dive; it can only fit about 25 people, your really never going to avoid a long wait and it's nothing special on the inside.\n\nThat aside, the food is RIDICULOUS. The butter burger is easily the best burger I've ever had. It's incomparable. I got a side of country fries which were also insanely delicious and tried the waffles which were unmatched in quality. They actually added a slight seasoning to the waffles which give it a nice touch to the sweetness.\n\nHighly recommended!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Num num num its Bacon. Great breakfast. I had the waffle with Bacon and sausage. I saw this place on DDD and had to make the trip.  It was really busy and they do not have a lot of seating so be prepared to wait 15 - 20 mins on the weekend.  It doesn't sound like much but I went there early and hungry.\n\nA must for Breakfast when you are in the area.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	basically i dont give a rat's **s on what the majority say i have never been treated like this in my life! saw it on foodnetwork, we just moved to az a month ago from los angeles. so after a 2 hr wait and it rained.....we were seated and for $4 we get a teeny cup of oj fresh squeezed i might add. we get the waffles with potatoes and thick bacon. it was ok but not worth the wait w/ kids! i didnt tip her becuz she just acted snippy. but we spent $47 so oh well. she comes running out the store like we stole something! was everything ok? (loud as ever) nevermind its a crowd waiting oiutside..she says rather loud...u didnt tip my server i said lady get out of my face u actlike i didnt pay the bill. its gratuity and there was no gratitude. i said your millionares after that show ...damn b&^%$# i will never go back. i also disputed the charge becuz she has the nerve to add 4 dollars in the tip line that i presigned. sheesh!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Always delicious !! Had their sausage with my breakfast this time, awesome!!\n\nExtra special bonus on my last visit...hot chic working there was wearing super short, super tight skirt, and little... to no underpants..and she kept wanting to pick things up from the floor, this was a great day.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Awesome American breakfast joint, the portions are big and the ingredients fresh. This place is small so you may need to wait but going on a weekday morning before work is not to bad  of a wait. This place is a great breakfast place but please no parties of six because you screw the rest of us who want to eat too :)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Finally made it to Matt's Big Breakfast.  I was prepared to wait a bit so didn't really mind that part, but they do need more seats in the shade.  \n\nThe menu at Matt's is somewhat limited.  While I like to keep things simple and can easily get overwhelmed by those menus with zillions of options, I was annoyed by the 'no substitutions' policy.  There was a daily special posted on the board that had jalapenos and sausage.  I don't eat sausage, so I asked if I could get a vegetable instead.  The answer was no.  Okay fine.  Could they add jalapeno to one of the dishes that didn't come with sausage?  No.  Ugh.  I ended up ordering the cheese omelet and paying $1 each for onion and red peppers.  \n\nI couldn't get enough of the hash browns, although unfortunately they were probably loaded with butter.  Good thing I went to kickboxing that day.  Overall this is a cute little restaurant with great food.  Just be prepared to wait and plan on your food being made Matt's way, not your way.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	For any of you that have been to Matt's and don't like it, no offense, but we wouldn't make a good breakfast eating team. \n\nBecause I love it. I had read and heard many a glowing review of this place from friends but the lingering question in the back of my mind was "How can bacon, toast, and eggs be that good?" Candidly, I still don't know the answer to that question. What I do know, however, is that it is, indeed, that good, if not better than I ever dreamed simple breakfast foods could be. \n\nThe line can be a formidable obstacle. There is a pad on top of the water by the front door where people write in the name of their party and number of people and you just wait for them to call your name into the tiny restaurant. I saw quite a few people outside, content to be waiting with a book, obviously knowing what they had in store.\n\nAs for the "too much butter" complaint from other reviewers, my advice is don't worry about it. If you want a light breakfast, Matt's isn't what you're looking for. For an obscenely delicious plate exploding with flavor and goodness, bring a book and post up at Matt's. It's worth it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Coming from busy Los Angeles, California, this place is stellar in the mellow neighborhood of Arizona. A little mom n pop breakfast house. Little in size but big in name where I had to wait for 45 minutes. Yes!! just for a plate of breakfast. \n\nFriend and I got the pesto pork chop and the hash brown ham combination. Hands down best hash brown ever! Crispy on the outside but savory sweet potatoes on the inside. Eggs were huge and had a very sweet yolk...organic maybe. \n\nOverall was just very satisfying for a simple American breakfast. Nothing fancy but premium ingredients for solid goodness. Honestly best hash brown  and home fried potatoes I've had thus far. Caramelized and seasoned to perfection. I can really eat potatoes every day if this place was around town.\n\nStreet parking but it's not bad at all on a weekend. I'm glad I was able to swing by on my visit here. Definitely must try if you're close in town.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We checked this place out after seeing it on the Food Network and it was delicious. The rosemary potatoes are top notch and the strawberry jam would be great on almost anything.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Very good traditional breakfast spot. I stopped in just as they opened during the week to make sure and grab a spot.  I was treated with a really tasty plate of eggs and peppered bacon.  One of the biggest pluses, Matt's actually knows how to cook hash browns, I didn't need to order them well done, they come nice and crispy as is.  The real show stealer is the toast and home made jam.  Nicely done breakfast at Matt's, go grab some!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Always a wonderful experience here. Fantastic staff, big portions, reasonable prices and delicious food. The new location is great - you still have to wait, but there is a lot more room inside and nice that there are more parking options outside.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I ADORE this place. Matt's has been a staple breakfast, brunch, whatever place for me since I moved to Downtown 5 years ago. They just moved to a great place up the street (where Verde used to be for locals) with more room so now everything isn't so crammed! Not that we all didn't enjoy their original house, this one just says, "I'm still awesome, I just stepped up a notch." Everything is delicious. I love their 5 Spot, the waffles are great, and their lunch specials are always amazing. If you like jelly - try their homemade stuff. Try the bacon.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I think Matt's has had its '5 minutes of fame'.  Note to owners: Your food is good enough,  your staff is great, so please save your money and move to a better location.  Right now, you're next to a rundown hotel with police baracade tape all over the place.The local residents(?) pan-handling all the waiting customers outside your place. Seriously?   Just sad.  Won't go again, won't recommend it either.  Good luck this summer, the heat will melt all your 'waiting area' customers out .
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	After a few times of walking past the group of hungry patrons waiting for their table at Matt's Big Breakfast, it was about time to stop in and try it myself. It was certainly worth the wait, and there is definitely nothing small about the breakfast. I had the special of the morning - three egg scramble with provolone, chicken sausage and spinach, and Sean S. had the griddlecakes. My scramble was the perfect mix of egg-y cheesy deliciousness for a Sunday morning breakfast. The home fries it came with were also mouthwatering. I think onions and fresh rosemary can make any potato taste good, and Matt's certainly had mastered this mix. I did try some of Sean's griddlecakes, and they were perfection - melt in your mouth, fluffy, and buttery. Finally, the service and the atmosphere were great. I don't think my waistline could handle Matt's often, but the breakfast is worth the indulgence occasionally.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	sorry, everyone else---all the crybabies that want a big place to get a table fast, absoulutely comfortable refrigirated air, and room for your party of 38.  this is not your place, so deal with it.\n\nwhat it is, and the only way i found the place was doing some work about a couple blocks away, and wanted to get a good bite to eat.  nothing special, but something close.\n\nsomeone on our work crew steered me here.  i went back the second day as well.  the food is fresh, plentiful, and the service--at least to me was really attentinve.  i was lucky to hit the place where i did not have to wait.  \n\nplaces like this are the kind that i keep coming back to.  the quality of the food that i had was very very good, and the prices are reasonable as well.\n\nit's a cute place, but if you don't want cute, don't want to wait, and don't appreciate the kind of place that matt's it----go somewhere else.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This is the idyllic breakfast stop for all you yelping food fanatics. Matt's is an upscale diner that will keep you believing breakfast really is the most important meal of the day; no matter how many carbs you just ate. My game plan was to order a meal and save half of it for later or even the next day; unfortunately, it was sooo good that I just couldn't stop.\n\nWhen they asked me what type of toast I wanted I half shrugged it off as just give me the "whatever" flavor and I won't eat it anyway. I generally stay away from generic tasting food in an effort to make my calories count for at the very least and awesome tasting meal.\n\nEven the toast was awesome! If they didn't bake the loaf of bread that my toast came from just as I was making my order, you could have foolded me. The hashbrowns were awesome, so much that I ate them all.  I wish I knew how to make my scrambled eggs taste like Matt does. You will not be dissapointed with any meal you order here.\n\nWords just don't give this breakfast joint justice, so be sure to check out all the pictures!\n\nExpect to pay about $10-11 per person after tax and tip for one of these awesome breakfast meals.\n\n**WARNING** Don't eat here if you are looking for just another breakfast place. **
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	As soon as we got word that class was canceled for the day we hit road with one destination in mind: Matt's Big Breakfast. This was my first experience with Matt's; my classmate is a little more cultured that I am, so he knew the ropes from previous experiences. \n\nThere really isn't a lot that the general public can use for parking near the restaurant, but I used my university parking pass to park in the ASU lot right across the street. Even though we went on a Tuesday morning the place was still packed. But the 20 minute wait wasn't bad because the weather was as nice as the outdoors waiting area. \n\nOnce we were seated (in pretty close quarters I might add) our waitress took our drink orders almost immediately. I got the honey lemonade which was such a great (and different) combination. \n\nMy classmate and I ordered the same breakfast entree: the five spot sandwich with a side of homestyle potatoes. Sweet Mary, the bacon on the sandwich was literally perfect. Everything tasted fantastic and complimented each other so well. \n\nI will eat here again whether or not my class has been canceled!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Awesome food in a fun setting.  Small place - only about 10 tables plus 4 seats at bar but worth a wait! Go during non peak times and you won't have to wait as long.  The fresh juice was good but in a TINY glass.  \nIt is a fun place but not sure I would wait over an hour for it!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I love this place! \n\nYes, the wait is long. I knew that going in, so it didn't really upset me. It's not as long if you go a little earlier in the morning. \n\nThe service is great. The owners are warm and cheery and remembered me the second time I went in! \n\nThe fresh squeezed orange juice is super yummy! Last time I went I got the porkchop and eggs. Mmmmm....
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	OK, I've wanted to try Matt's for a while, but I had drivien by and seen how small it was and heard of the long lines to get in. When I get up, I'm hungry and ready to eat...\n\nI happened to get up early last Saturday and thought "Hey, maybe I can get a seat at Matt's if I get over there early!" In a few minutes, my companion and I were on the road and on the way to Matt's as fast as her little Scion XB could carry us...\n\nMy master plan was a success and we were seated within minutes of arriving. I ordered the Chop & Chick, and my friend ordered the special which was a scramble with chicken sausage, cheese, and greens.\n\nWe were seated at the window bar and enjoyed several cups of good diner coffee (nice and strong, without being bitter) while we waited... \n\nand waited... and waited...\n\nWe noticed several tables come and go while we were waiting and as we were starting to get worried, Matt came to our table and apologetically told us that our ticket had fallen and gotten lost for a while and that our food was their top priority at that point. In the next five minutes, I'm pretty sure that every employee came by to apologize to us and ask if there was anything that they could get for us.\n\nWhen our food did arrive is was steaming hot and delicious. \n\nThe Chop & Chick was exactly as one would expect. Perfectly cooked over-easy eggs, no gooey whites, but plenty of liquid yolk with which to dip my home fries in. The pork chop was of average breakfast size, but cooked well and still nice and juicy.\n\nMy companion's special scramble was so good that it made me question my undying love of the majikal animal (pork) and the hash browns were awesomely crispy (but begging to be covered in gravy ;-)\n\nAs we ate, Matt came by and apologized again for losing our ticket and asked us to enjoy our breakfast on the house. It was so good that I kinda felt bad about taking them up on their offer, but I decided that I'd make it up to them by going out of my way for more early breakfasts there.\n\nSo, was it a perfect breakfast experience? No.\nBut the manner in which the mistake was handled, the professionalism of the staff, and the quality of the food puts Matt's Big Breakfast at or near the top of my Phoenix breakfast list.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Got 3 dishes because me and the boyfriend are greedy like that.  Eggs with salami was truly outstanding. Creative and delicious. Eggs and pork chop were ok. Chop flavor was good but a bit over cooked. Waffle was good, nothing special. Hash browns and home fries both pretty good, not great. Good coffee.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I have found that during the summer on a Sunday morning before 930 is the best time to go to Matt's....at least that is my favorite time.   Why you may ask? No wait!  I have yet to wait in line at all when I go that early.  But mostly I have been by myself and I find a seat at the counter.  \n\nWhile I scan through the specials, I find myself more often than not, getting the Hog and Chick with Bacon and Hashbrowns.  I have tried the sausage patties and the ham.  I was not impressed by the saugage and while the ham is VERY good, the bacon still wins out.  The hashbrowns alone keep coming back for more and I am not a big potatoe fan.\n\nBut I admit I am spoiled living just a few blocks away....
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Get the home fries get the home fries get the home fries.\n\nHow I never heard of this place before is beyond me. Found it by accident over the weekend and have never been so happy.  Ive been looking for a good greasy spoon breakfast place since i moved here and this place is great.\n\nIts small, there will be a line, but its so worth it.  I got the 5 spot (SUPER thick bacon, REAL eggs, onions, cheese on a roll) and my boyfriend got the griddlecakes, it was delicious.\n\nThe waitresses were nice, the place was clean which i imagine is a chore considering the cramped quarters, and the food is just awesome.\n\nIts casual, you should show up early, and 2 people can eat very well for under 20 bucks.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I travel to Phoenix often and after several attempts to bypass long lines, I was able to get seated after a 20 minute wait. With that said, dishes with eggs and home fries were excellent. The chops were dry and not really flavorful. We sat at the counter and the service was efficient without feeling rushed. I liked this place, but the wait and the metered street parking doesn't make this a very convenient option for a weekday breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Went here for the first time last month. I had read a lot of reviews and was expecting a wait. It was about 15-20 minutes so it was not too bad, and definitely worth it. The place is just so cute inside. The bread was amazing and the preserves were awesome. I love that they only cook with real butter and olive oil. The husband loves green Tabasco on his eggs (any pretty much everything else) and they didn't have any so that was a bummer but the food was very fresh. A very unique place, I would definitely recommend it!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Nothing but fat and grease! EEEK. \n\nGriddlecakes are great, however... everything else comes with fat, cut from fat. I'm sure it's good, just not my thing. \n\nBTW, be prepared to wait, and wait, and wait some more for a table. Come in with a bag of snacks if you're really starving and ready to eat. \n\nP.S. did I mention the wait??! YES!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Yes, we all know about the breakfast....I give it a 4. \n\nToday though, I went in for lunch. Gosh dang, 5 stars, it was amazing!\n\nI ordered the Chicken sandwich - Heaven! \nMy friend got the butter burger and he claims it may now be his top burger in Phoenix (even over the Chuckbox!) \n\nHomemade chips, toasted buns, garlic pickle, and just perfectly cooked meat.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Yeah...........What everyone else said.........Food is great.  Restaurant is small.  Line is long.  Service is great.  \n\nIf they delivered this would be the world's best breakfast place.  Even if they had take out.  But delivery?  That would be fantastic.  I could totally picture myself hung over eating a hog and chick in bed.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I loved this place. Its super tiny but the food comes out pretty quickly and they turn tables fast. I ordered the special which had eggs, ham, Fresno peppers, and cheese and came with hashbrowns. Everything was absolutely delicious. Their toast, as well, was a huge highlight. We didn't wait long because we called beforehand and were put on the list. They don't really have a host/hostess, you just write your name on the list, which I found interesting. I spent most of the meal gawking at one of their employees, Travis, who was absolutely adorable. I wish they had eggs benedict, but the food they had definitely made up for it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	If you're in the area and you have a small party, give it a shot.  It'll be good not great.  \n\nI love breakfast so I'd combed the Internet for breakfast joints to visit while in Phoenix.  Matt's Big Breakfast was near the top of the list.  \n\nFinally made it there today with my mom - not the most adventurous eater but game for a good experience.  She was turned off by the flies and the heat inside the restaurant but did enjoy her tuna sandwich and potato chips.  The tuna was tasty - light, not too soggy, not too much relish or add-ins.  It tasted pretty fresh and the bread was delicious - definitely not just out of a plastic bag.  The chips were a little cool but the pepper was a nice addition.\n\nI've read complaints about the coffee and I'd agree it wasn't that good.  Not awful but if you're open to other beverages I'd say grab something else when you're there.\n\nI had two eggs over easy, whole grain toast, and hash browns.  The hash browns were some of the greasiest I've ever eaten (and I eat a lot of hash browns) but at least we're dealing with real butter and olive oil at this place.  The potatoes are grated really fine which perhaps adds to your ability to see all the grease.  They were greasy but tasty.  Still, the home fries on a plate nearby looked equally, if not, more tasty.  The eggs were fine and the bread was delicious. I had to order everything a la carte because the only two egg breakfast on the menu involved bacon.  \n\nThere are mostly 2 seater tables though they can pull up an extra chair to some of the tables but if you've got a larger party, prepare to wait. There's also counter space for people who are open to sitting at the counter.\n\nIf you go around 1:30 pm, there's definitely no wait! :)\n\nThe service was friendly though not particularly helpful.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	There isn't much to say about Matt's other than they have the best damn breakfast in the Valley.  You have to appreciate a homegrown diner where the owner makes everyday appearances, his wife runs the place, and they use the best, freshest, local ingredients.  Kudos.\n\nI get the Hog and Chick every single time I go, I never stray.  Eggs over medium, hash browns, wheat toast, and the best damn bacon ever.  Always perfect every time.  I have never tasted bacon so good in my life.  The hash browns are out of this world.  They get shredded super fine and are cooked up on the griddle in loads of butter.  The BEST.\n\nIf you want to seem cool and in the know, at lunch time order the Insider Burger.  It's a traditional burger smothered in cheese, bacon added, and topped with an egg.  My brother loves it.  Similar to a Royal Red Robin Burger, but obviously superior.\n\nThe only negative is the wicked crowd that can form for breakfast.  Bring a lot of water with you and some sunscreen if you can brave the summer wait.\n\nSimply put, this place is amazing.  I am so lucky to be so close to this place.  Sometimes to avoid the wait, my husband and I wake up at 6:30 on a Saturday morning, head over for breakfast and beat the crowds.  After a hearty button bursting breakfast, we ride our bikes home and go back to sleep.  That is the life my friends.  You should try it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Get the salami scramble and enjoy. \n\nGreat service and amazing food makes the wait almost bearable, but sometimes you just want quality breakfast without putting your name in and getting dolled up  for the paparazzi. \n\nIn the end I'll continue to go and wait in the line, but I don't have to like it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We were visiting AZ this past weekend, and decided to try Matt's based on all of the great YELP reviews.  After an hour of waiting outside in the rain, the host called our name and said, "we'll be seating you shortly" and handed us menus.  He then came out 5 minutes later and said he was going to take our orders so he could get the kitchen started.  When we were finally seated (at the counter - not even a table) our food was served in about 10 minutes.  It was good (a little greasy) but I would never again wait an hour for breakfast.  Also, they don't have a bathroom in the facility.  You have to go next door!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Food was pretty good but the service was terrible. \n1. There was hair in one of our waffle plates. \n2. The servers were not very attentive. \n3. When we had a mistake on an order, the waitress rudely confronted us instead of being accommodating.\n 4. I had to wait over 5 minutes (after the rest of my party had walked out) just for them to notice I was waiting for the check. And last when I paid the bill they did not bother to ask how everything was. Poor service ruins even a great meal and I will NEVER return and let my friends know to not bother going there.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Saw this establishment on Diners, Drive-ins, & Dives. Guy Fieri was raving about his termed out of bounds breakfast choices. Matt appeared very courteous. Not as good as they say. They are all right. The reason is there's always a line is because this place is so darn tiny. Didn't have a restroom available... What's up with that? Will admit the service was efficient.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Look, there is no reason for you to read the 51st review on this place unless you specifically sought me out and you trust me.  Matt's is good!  Go stuff yo face in a waffle and that thick cut bacon.  Mmm!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This is the best breakfast I've ever had.  Period.  The food was SO good that it totally outweighed the wait outside on a hot day.\n\nYes, you WILL wait if you come here, but it is absolutely worth it.  The staff here are quite adept at quickly moving people through the restaurant without making anyone feel terribly rushed, and other than your wait to get seated, you won't wait long on anything else.\n\nMost breakfast places excel at one or two things, usually the sweeter side of breakfast (pancakes, waffles, etc).  I don't tend to eat a lot of these, so I'm stuck getting some half-toasted toast, eggs, and potatoes.\n\nNot here.  Here everything on their menu looks good and is even better in execution.\n\nI did end up ordering the toast, eggs, and potatoes, to be fair, but I still can't forget just how good they were.  The toast was a whole-grain variety, thickly sliced, nutty, and perfectly toasted.  It was served with butter and jam, and it was so good that I was reluctant to let my friend try any of it.  The potatoes were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, but both the toast and the potatoes paled in comparison to the eggs.\n\nYes.  Eggs.  Matt's Big Breakfast earns my nod as the best breakfast joint I've ever patronized because of their eggs.  They were scrambled, but something about them was so mouthwatering that I was disappointed when I finished them.   Most scrambled eggs at other restaurants are served cold, dry, chewy, or any number of other unappetizing ways.  Not at Matt's.  I'm sure they cooked them in butter or something equally as awful for you but, damn, were they ever good.  To this day, nearly a year later, I still have not had better eggs anywhere else.  Believe me, I've tried.  Nothing beats Matt's.\n\nEverything else looked amazing, and they frequently feature specials.\n\nThis is the Pizzeria Bianco of breakfast in Phoenix.  Long waits, but a must-attend for each and every Phoenician.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I have been a fan of Matt's for the last 3 years. I go there at least once a week to meet with my circle of friends. Ernie the owner has become a great friend and is an awesome example of someone who has connected with the culture of urban Phoenix. The only drawback which is also Matt's strength is that it is a small place good for only groups of 4 or so. I have had Matt's all to myself with bigger groups of 20 but it requires planning ahead. I suggest going with either the Hog and Chick or try the waffles.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Nice breakfast. Another 30 minute wait for food, but I thought it was pretty worth it.\n\nTheir special for the day was a three egg scramble with chicken artichoke sausage, organic baby spinach and mozzarella cheese. Very unique and executed quite well - loved the sausage and the freshness of the spinach.\n\nThe hash browns were a litte strange (like what would happen if you pressed a potato through a spaghetti-making pasta machine) but nice and  crunchy on the outside.\n\nMy wife got the ham and eggs. These were also good, with nicely salted ham.\n\nWe also had a side of bacon, which was well peppered and cooked almost to a crisp.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'm pretty pumped that its cooling off outside cause I'll be able to make my way down to Matt's for breakfast on Saturdays again. I tend to stay away during the summer months cause I sweat like a fat kid in a cannibal camp and would rather not wait the hour or so it takes to be seated. \n\nVery few places in town do I feel as "at home" as I do at Matt's. The staff is always friendly as are most of the patrons. For such a long wait and for the patrons to be in such good moods they have to be doing something right! The food is fantastic. I love how they find locally grown and raised food and only stock what is in season. The food alone makes Matt's one of my favorite spots for breakfast in town, but its the consistency in the ambiance that makes it my #1 breakfast spot in town.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Another DDD try, we had to come here twice. The first time it was just to crowded. Glad we came back. I really enjoyed the daily special, which changes every day. Also enjoyed the waffles. Wife and daughter enjoyed the usual eggs and hashbrowns. Very friendly service would come again!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ok.  I'm finally getting in tune with Yelp and I'm writing a long overdue review of one of my favorite restaurants of all time-Matt's Big Breakfast.  When I think of what is important to me in a restaurant, it's two things plain and simple-food and service-and Matt's excels at both.  Honestly, these are the type of people, Matt and Ernie and their staff, that America's needs more of...good hearted, honest, hard working people who give a shit about their customers.  They're as American as Apple Pie!  \n\nThe food: everything on the menu is very good but in my mind two things stand out and they are as good as it gets in Phoenix...the waffle and the cheeseburger.  Oh, and the bacon.  A cheeseburger brushed with butter.  Get the fuck outta town.  This is the mother fuckin shit y'all.  I consider myself a burger afficianado and this burger is the bombay.  \n\nThere is an occasional wait because Guy Fieri pimps this place on the Food Network all the time but hell, why wouldn't he, it's the shit.  I pimp it all the time myself.  I may get a Matt's Big Breakfast logo on my pimpstick it's so good.  The best times to go are during the weekdays in the early morning around 7AM or after 1:00PM.  \n\nGoGOGOGOGOGOOGOG....you'll be glad you did!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My husband surprised me with breakfast take-out here a few weekends ago and I was a giggling mess. I had the perma-grin waiting for him to get back with my favorite item, the Salami Scramble. It is scrambled eggs mixed with sliced salami, with their awesome thick toast and your choice of hashbrowns or home fries. The jelly they give with the toast is delicious, as well. I can't say I am a huge fan of the potatoes as both the home fries and hashbrowns tend to be really greasy. That's okay, though, because the rest of the food is great. They also have thick-cut bacon you can order on the side that is pretty wonderful. I have eaten in the restaurant, sometimes, and I never had to wait too long and usually the wait seems to go by fast. Inside, the service is pretty efficient which at times can seem like they are pushing you out. But everyone is really friendly. I love that the farmer's market is right across the street which is great if you want to get out and have a nice breakfast before hitting the market. Matt's is closed on Mondays, FYI. Don't be like me trying to hit it up on a Monday off and throwing the collossal temper-tamptrum in the parking lot.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Believe the hype. That's all I can say. \n\nThis place is the kama sutra of flavor for your taste buds.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'm going to sum up my own experiences and some Pros and Cons for people from reviews already posted, to give people a good starting information point.\n\nI had the Chop and Chick.  It was great.  If you like breakfast pork chops, this one is top of the line.  The breads and jellies are great too.  The hash browns, crispy and buttery.\n\nWhat I did not like is getting FLAT OUT RIPPED OFF with the TINY, TINY glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice they offer for $2.50.  I mean it's literally only about 3-4 ounces.  Tiny.  Grossly overpriced.  It's like they priced it like that to DISSUADE people from buying it.  Hate this about Matt's.\n\nPros:\n\nFresh, local ingredients, well-prepared and tasty.\nMany people say this is the best restaurant breakfast they have had, or among the best.\nPeople LOVE the buttery, crisp hash browns, and the home fries get a lot of praise also.\nAlthough the wait can be long, many people say it's totally worth it.\n\nCons:\nThe wait can be soul-crushingly long.  The place is TINY.\nStupidly overpriced orange juice. Fresh-squeezed, but JEEZ !!!\nTiny parking lot also.\n\nSo, ingest all that info, and decide if Matt's is for you.  \n\nHappy Yelping !!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that it's a victim of it's own success. My husband and I used to frequent all the time, but now that it's become so popular, we refuse to wait an hour for brunch, even on the weekdays. If you do decide to wait it out, the food is amazing, and the home fries are worth the wait alone. Very friendly wait staff, and cute place, albeit very small..
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Would you like some food with your butter?\n------------------------------\nFinally made my way down to Matt's Big Breakfast with some friends. We got there at about 10:30 and waited about 10 minutes for a table for 3, so that was pretty good, considering how small the place is.\n\nThe cute and feisty waitress got us all coffee, plus I got the OJ (Sarah K's review was spot on - it really is a tiny glass with half of it pulp). I ordered the cheese omelette with mushrooms & sauteed onions, sided with home fries and wheat toast. My friends got the hog & chick and a cheese omelette, both with well-done hash browns. We then ordered a plate of griddle cakes to split three ways. \n\nThe food soon was laid in front of us. All I can say is, I hope you like butter. Because butter was everywhere. I came prepared though, armed with my quiver of Lactaid pills. So bring it on, Matthew. I'm ready.\n\nThe food was great. Omelette was perfect and the home fries, seasoned with rosemary, were excellent. The griddle cakes were perfect for me, since I'm a big fan of the real maple syrup and light, fluffy flapjacks. My friends were fans of their hash browns, completely crisp and crunchy on the outside, and runny with butter on the inside. I'd never seen hash browns like this before, but I took a biteful to see for myself and the verdict? Really, really good. My friends enjoyed their meals, and our coffees and water were always being refilled, which was a great plus, along with our ongoing bantering with the waitress. \n\nDefinitely a great place to start off your Saturday morning.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We went on a Sunday afternoon, the wait was 45 mins for 4 people. We waited because everyone keeps talking about it. Man, was I starving to death when we were seated. I had the ham and cheese omelet and everyone shared an order of waffle with everyone else. The omelet was good. The waffles were light and fluffy. Good but not to die for. I personally think it was over hyped. It is good breakfast food, not GREAT.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Bacon? Outstanding.  Griddle cakes?  Crave-worthy.  Home-fries?  Awesomely awesome.  Service?  Ehhh.  Love this little joint tucked into a one-bedroom house!  The food was amazing -- I can still taste those griddle cakes, BUT the service left something to be desired (more about that later).  My hubby got the three-meat scramble with hashbrowns, and it came with a tortilla.  He gobbled it down, apparently it was really good.  We never got any hot sauce, after two requests.  I ordered the two-egg breakfast with bacon.  The bacon was to die for, the best I think I've ever had.  The thick sourdough toast which accompanied my meal was served with real butter and fresh strawberry jam.  The combo was killer!  All in all, a fantastic breakfast!\n\nAbout the service -- The female waitress who greeted me at the door specifically told myself and two other parties that were waiting that they ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES, no waiting at the table for someone else to show.  She must have said this three or four times.  I pointed to my hubby, who was parking the car across the street and told her he'd be here in just a minute, and she reiterated, WE ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES.  I was told to add my name to a list outside, even though he was 30 seconds away!  An older woman appears at the door and asks for a table, and tells the waitress her husband is parking the car.  "Oh, okay, I can get you a table right now," says the waitress.  No "WE ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES."  No "ADD YOUR NAME TO THE LIST OUTSIDE EVEN THOUGH HE MIGHT BE HERE IN 30 SECONDS."  Noooooo.  Instead it's "Oh, okay, I can get you a table right now."  GRRRRRR.  I piped up and said, "Oh, here he is.  We're ready now."  The waitress responds, "I'm going to get her a table, I'll be right back."  GRRRR.  I HATE people who say one thing and do another.  I was seeing red at this point, but the place is so danged small I couldn't tell my hubby what I was so pissed off about!!!  Anyhow, the waitress "that wouldn't seat us" buzzed our table once or twice, and I asked for water THREE TIMES before a very kind gentleman waiter got it for me.  They forgot my OJ -- he brought it out after I asked the other waitresses TWICE.  Hot sauce?  Never appeared on our table, even after two requests.  Just a tip -- the female waitresses were ditzy as hell.  Ask for a male waiter!!  (sorry if that sounds sexist, but I'm a woman and I know what good service looks like.  This was NOT IT.)\n\nMy rating above is based on the FOOD (5 STARS) minus one star for the SERVICE (TWO STARS).  (I know, I know, five minus two is three, but I just couldn't bring the food rating that low, It was THAT GOOD)  In fact, I think I'm heading out now for some of those griddle cakes.  From a male server.  See ya!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	i know the real secret to Matt's Wu-tang Style. \n\nsome people may think Matt's is over rated. but i know that to be false. Matt's is THE BEST BREAKFAST...period. there has not been a single time i was unhappy with the service, price, or wait. \ni would wait an hour, heck two hours if need be. \n\nthe 5-spot is by far my favorite breakfast item. its like a full on taste cell orgy. with over 50 taste cells per taste bud and a human tongue containing several million taste buds you have to figure that is alot of ecstasy in your mouth. \n\nif i could justify the time spent waiting as a business expense i would be there every morning. \n\nMatt and Erenia have a great thing going here.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Coming back from the airport after dropping off the wife, my son said "Dad, I want a GOOD breakfast"....  well my little foodie had a great idea, so I decided to take the advice of Yelp and stopped in at Matt's Big Breakfast.  \n\nOk, my first reaction to following my GPS device's guidance was "woah...I really don't need to get hit up for spare change today".  But once I decided that the neighborhood was ok, I decided to just forget about the surroundings, and give Matt's a try.  I am so glad we did!\n\nService:  Quick, friendly, and accurate!  An instant plus!\n\nFood:  I had a basic eggs and meats breakfast with hashbrowns.  The highlight was the bacon (OMG was it good) and the sausage (WOW!)\n\nMy son had the salami scramble and man did he chow!  He immediately noted we needed to come back and bring mom.\n\nThe orange juice was clearly fresh squeezed and was just great!!!\n\nWhat can I say, the reviews I read were right.  This place rocks!  It was very much worth five stars!\n\nOh, and don't park in the ASU lot or Barney Fife will give you a lecture like he did to me today.  This annoying little man was literally clicking his heels (jackboots) to lecture me about not parking...and I had to tell him to cut to the chase...as his lecture was going on forever.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Okay, I admit it - we are waaaaay late to this party. We tried once before but the hour-plus wait was just two much for the four starving carnivores with me that day. This time our strategy was to go early on a Saturday morning as close to 6:30am opening as possible. We arrived around 7:15 (it WAS the weekend after all) and only waited about 20min for a table for two. \n\nI had the special of the day - 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese - YUM! The sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked. My companion had the hog and chick - awesome meaty bacon with that.\n\nGreat value for the price - I packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home (who could not be roused at dawn). If you haven't been, get up early, bring a newspaper and rest assured Matt's Big is well worth the wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Finally got something I've never had at this place: Good service....obviously a Phoenix landmark that should be visited by all at least once, but new location loses some of the old charm.  Limited menu, but pretty good...expect a long line...
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What's that you say? This is the best breakfast in town? Why I think you're right! Simply put, Matt's does the simple American breakfast and they do it rather well. I go for waffle, eggs, bacon, home fries. BAM. A good morning indeed. Small, cute, very 50s feeling. Sure, there's a line out the door, but it's well worth the wait. Trust me.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	As soon as I found out I would be traveling to Phoenix, I began looking up places to eat. Matt's Big Breakfast was the first thing to crank up my Yelpdar!\n\nB R I E F  S U M M A R Y\n-- Probably the most reviewed/well known place in downtown Phoenix\n-- Featured on TV like everyone else said\n-- This newer location is a block further than the old (way bigger now!)\n-- Warm & welcoming ambience\n-- Friendly and attentive staff (seems like they have a system)\n-- I recommend coming early, only 6 tables @ 6:45am (Wed morning)\n-- Salami scramble was definitely unique but needed some cheese\n-- Potatoes had decent flavor (rosemary) but I wish I got hash browns\n-- Waffle was hot & fresh & syrup was high quality\n-- Sourdough toast was thick & good\n-- Strawberry preserves were delicious!\n-- The regular menu is very limited\n-- Staff recommends trying the specials\n-- Very sad I couldn't try the french toast, it's ONLY a special! :(\n\nWell I woke up super early because I didn't want to get stuck here and I had a meeting at 8am! I forgot that AZ is an hour ahead of CA. I woke up so tired and barely made it here at 6:45am. I walked from the Westin which was a healthy walk at 6 in the morning! I was a bit disappointed to find the old location but luckily I saw the new location was only a block further.\n\nI really like the feel and ambience of Matt's Big Breakfast (MBB). The wait staff were all ladies and they were all very friendly and attentive even at 6am! I was barely awake and I wasn't sure if I was going to come here again so I ended up ordering basically 2 dishes so I could try 2 things. My server loves the waffle so I had to get it. The special she also recommended but I'm just not a fan of apple sausage so I opted for the salami scramble. \n\nI'm from the San Francisco bay area so I'm almost accustomed to what MBB is doing with fresh, local ingredients. I applaud them for keeping their food quality so high but I wasn't uberly impressed because I'm sort of used to it. I expect to pay a decent amount of money for high quality food. I didn't feel like MBB was overpriced, I thought the prices were about right in my opinion.\n\nThe waffle was above average and I could taste the quality of the syrup. I really wanted the french toast but it wasn't being offered. To me, if you're famous for french toast, you should offer it on your menu! Nevertheless, the waffle is a good alternative. \n\nThe salami scramble was so unique and different. I've never had anything quite like it but I really wish they would have added some creamy cheese to smooth out the salami after taste. I think I added some ketchup or hot sauce to my potatoes and it helped balance the salami. If you like salami, I recommend. I probably wouldn't order again, I just was feeling adventurous. I was a bit surprised that the sourdough bread was so thick but it was still good. The preserves really enabled me to eat all of it otherwise it would been just too much bread for me.\n\nClearly this place is living up to the hype as it is the number 1 rated place in downtown Phoenix. I didn't search further than that because I didn't have a rental car or anything. I would definitely recommend coming here and if I'm ever out here again, I hope that I can grab some of their french toast!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place is the best breakfast in town. It used to be so easy to get a table too until Guy Fierri  had them on his show and now you wait at least 45 mins for a table.  But the food is so good OMG it is still worth it. It is so tiny but the food is huge!! The fresh fruit preserves on the homemade bread, the home fries with fresh rosemary and caramelized onions, yummy sunny side up eggs with a GIANT piece of ham. I just cannot stress enough how mouth watering delicious this little gem is :)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	WOW! This is one of the best breakfast I've had in years, from the fresh OJ, amazing Cave Creek Coffee, special three egg scramble with bacon, locally grown peppers and fontina cheese, with a tortilla and oh the rosemary home fries... drool. My family took me here and I would recommend this to anyone who lives in or is visiting Phoenix. Tuesday morning we waited about five minutes for a table. This really is the best quality local produce in a great little diner. Next time I'm in Phoenix I will have to try the Butter Burger.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My friend recommended this place when she was visiting me in Phoenix because she heard about this place on food channel. It was on triple D's (Diners, Drive-in, Dives). We came here on a Sunday morning for a late brunch (around 1pm).\n\nWhen we arrived there, it was street parking. We were able to find a place on the street. The place is very small, it reminds me of a very casual, good home-cooking restaurant - not fancy but just good food.\n\nWe put our name on the list outside. For a party of two, our wait was about 30-45 minutes. It was long but it didn't feel too long. It was a hot day so we waited in the shade. The hostess that sat us was very nice. We sat at the bar. My friend ordered the scramble special and I decided to order the Chop and Chick with wheat toast, hashbrowns and over easy eggs.\n\nThey served water in a little jars which I love. It's so cute and it reminds me of a simple, home-cooked. I looked around to see what everyone else was eating, it seems like couples like to split the food because the portions are big. Hence, the name "Matt's Big Breakfast."\n\nService is quick. The waitress and waiters are attentive and they are constantly moving. The food came out in a decent time, it wasn't too long but not too quick. \n\nWhen our food arrived, I almost thought they forgot my toast with my order. I asked them about it but they assured they did not forget me. My pork chop tasted like a pork chop I can make at home. I was a pan-fried pork chop that was oily and greasy. It wasn't seasoned too heavily, it wasn't too salty or peppery. The hashbrowns were very oily as well. I would like the hasbrown to be more crispy than oily. It was softer than I like. The wheat toast came with homemade strawberry jam. The strawberry jam was very sweet and had a strong strawberry aroma, I like the jam. \n\nMy breakfast was decent, it wasn't spectacular or horrible. It was a little more oily than I expected. It is your typical homecooked breakfast, they didn't mess up my order or anything.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Finally got to try Matt's EARLY one Sunday morning with the family.  Luckily they arrived well before I did and I didn't have to wait very long.  The place is small, like previous posters have alluded too.  You don't get how small until you actually go.  10 tables and 7 seats at the counter, tops.  The waits can be long and now I know why.\n\nSo we were a party of 8.  The parents sat at a table and the "kids" sat at the counter.  The menu is simple with not a lot to choose from.  I heard the pancakes were great, but I like a little more substance with my breakfast.  I chose the special, 3 egg scramble with bacon, cheddar, and fresh jalapenos, rosemary home fries and a tortilla.  Not being a huge jalapeno fan I almost had them nixed from the order, but decided to go with it.  Glad I did.  It was great and the peppers added a nice little bit of heat.  The rosemary home fries were outstanding!  I know all of this sounds very simple and you could probably make this at home, but it always tastes so much better when someone else makes it!  \n\nI think this place is worth the hype!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Teeny Tiny little place with little room to breath inside. Food was just OK IMO.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Whoa - what a bunch of spoilsports!  \n\nWhat's not to love about Matt's Big Breakfast (except for the wait)?  My friend and I are serious breakfast aficionados, hailing from Philly where we regularly b'fast at Sabrina's, Honey's, Carmen's Country Kitchen and Morning Glory Diner - all fine, glorious breakfast establishments.  Suffice it to say that neither of us are slouches when it comes to knowing a killer breakfast when we come across one - and he makes a mean frittata himself and I make sublime homemade buttermilk pancakes.  \n\nI read about Matt's online (altho I must say that I somehow fortunately missed the  ridiculously pretentious and nit-picky (too much rosemary for your retainer??? Get a life!) "yelp" reviews) so we decided to stop by for breakfast after flying in to Phoenix this past Saturday.  \n\nAs much as we love a good b'fast, we both despise a long wait ... but hey, we had nothing better to do and struck up conversations with other waiting souls and paid a visit to the nearby flea-bag Coronado Motel to use the restroom and soak up the atmosphere.  Matt's provides a cooler of flavored water and the time passed pretty quickly.\n\nIT WAS SO WORTH THE WAIT!  It's days later and I can still taste the perfectly light and fluffy (neither undercooked or overcooked) omelette, brimming with top quality cheddar cheese (who could imagine a basic omelette could taste so heavenly?).  The home-fries were bursting with flavor with the addition of rosemary, onions and peppers ... and the toast ... oh the toast ... homemade sourdough cut into thick slices, toasted and served with homemade jam.  My partner's special was eggs blended with some kind of slightly spicy sausage and cheese.  The coffee, too, is perfect, neither too strong or too mild and served with real cream and raw sugar.  \n\nService is fast, friendly and we were treated to the owner's adorable son seating guests and advising of the day's specials.  \n\nDidn't need to eat again until dinner - if you're in Phoenix, ignore the "yelp" twitwits - you simply MUST visit Matt's Big Breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	way overrated! bathroom in the kitchen, gross!  know what you're eating!  how much was the oj again?
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We decided to try the place out after seeing it on food network's diners, drive in, and dives.  I thought it was pretty good but my wife did not like it becasue it was to greasy. she did not like the butter fat.  We did have to wait a long time to eat.  It's small and they had a lot of flies in the windows which was a big turn off.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Whether you treat breakfast like dessert or like bbq, this is the place to start your day.  I recommend the ridiculous waffle or the salami scramble. What I am talking about... order both, you deserve it!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's is DELICIOUS. Yes there is a wait but it's so worth it. Best waffle I've ever had!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I had heard about this place since I moved here 3 years ago... But had been detoured by the long wait that comes with the fantastic reputation.\nI had some friends in town.. we ventured down there. We waited 45 minutes. We weren't expecting anything great by that point, but were committed to trying it.\nThe gave us menus in line & took our order, so that when we sat down finally, our food & drink followed immediately.\nAs doubtful as we were after standing that long, I have to say it was worth every minute. Down to the coffee, everything was spectacular. I ordered the special, steak and eggs. BEST BREAKFAST EVER!\nLike me, don't wait so long to try it and don't be discouraged by the long lines. It is phenomenal.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. Arrived for a late Thursday morning breakfast (11am) and only had to wait 5-10 minutes. Server was friendly and I had the chorizo scramble special. It was great! Very tasty and flavorful. I am one of the pickiest breakfast eaters (i.e. I don't really consider US Egg & Denny's breakfast places). I expect my eggs and all the ingredients to be fresh, and that was certainly the case at Matt's!! This is one of my two favorite breakfast places in the valley (for different reasons, I consider Matt's and the Orange Table to be complimentary).
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Wake up in the morning, food was on my  mind. Whats a good place to eat? "Heard the food portion at Matt's was astronomical!" Asked myself, Am I really that hungry? Yes, Yes I AM! \n\nKnowing that a trendy brunch place like this would attract a lot of locals and travelers. I had mentally prepped myself to wait an hour. But who knew Matt's big breakfast would be contained in such a small place. I had waited almost 90 minutes to be seated. Good thing it was breezy that day, or it woulda been pretty intense wait.\n\nOnce seated, pretty much knew exactly what I wanted to order until I saw the special. 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese. Sounds amazing. Got an order of that and an order of the Hog & Chick w/ hash browns.\n\nThe 3 egg scramble\nDefinitely prettier dish of those 2. The presentation was definitely on point, the plate was full of fluffy eggs with melted fontina cheese on top. The rest of the plate was filled up with the country fries(potato). The bed of baby spinach added contrast to the plate. A dish that pleases the eye as much as the tongue. The andouille sausage/egg/fontina cheese was good combo. The flavor of all 3 really worked together, instead of fighting each other.\n\nHog & Chick w/ hash browns\nThis one was less aesthetically pleasing. But don't let looks fool  you. This piece of pork chop is mighty tasty. The hash was real good. They browned both sides of the hash, and added some other stuff. It was tasty and had good consistency. Wish the chop was a thicker cut. I'd pay more for a thicker cut.\n\nEverything here tasted good, and stood out from other diners. It was not expensive at all. But good food from a small place like that just means a long wait in line to be seated. I think they do take out. So'd recommend take out or showing up early.  But if I had to wait in line again, I would totally do it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	no place i would rather be on a Saturday at 6:30 a.m.  then at Matt's Big Breakfast -definately we worth getting up early for with a small group of great friends - the best breakfast joint in Phoenix!!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Let me start by saying I hate waiting in line.  If I could, I would get an intern just to wait in line for me.  Having said that, I have waiting in line more than once for breakfast here.  The food is delicious.  I'm not sure if its the copious amounts of butter in the food but I swear it is the best toast and breakfast potatoes in town.  Oh and the main dishes are great too.  The place is tiny, and they really didn't spend much money on decor.  But really, who cares when breakfast is this delicious?!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	While in Phoenix, walked to Matt's for breakfast on Saturday morning. Not being really familar with it, I had no expectations. We ended up having to wait over an hour to be seated - mostly because this place is really freaking small. (If you have a big group, you'll take up the entire restaurant and that's just rude.) The menu is pretty sparse, but has something for everyone. I got the hog and chick - with scrambled eggs (just ok), thick cut bacon (it was heavy on the pepper but good), hash browns (odd, the home fries looked better) and sourdough toast (next time, I'm just getting the toast. The sourdough was awesome). With a coffee, I think my total was around $10-11 - not too bad. \n\nOverall, if it was a random day during the week with no wait, I'd be more excited. I'm not sure it was worth the wait - but my cousin is still talking about how great it was.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	After a late night out with a few college buddies, we woke up @ the downtown Hyatt starving for a hearty meal.  Einstein Bro's Bagels located downstairs, wasn't gonna satisfy our insatiable craving for some rib-stickin, home cooked food.  \n\nWhen we arrive, there are people milling about the exterior of this tiny restaurant, sipping orange infused water provided by the staff.  We assumed it must be excellent, if these people were willing to wait in the sweltering heat for a coveted seat.\n\nAfter 15-20 minutes, we feel like celebrities on the VIP list as we're escorted through the door.  I order the Hog & Chick, which provided more than enough hash browns, eggs, toast, and sausage to quell the lumberjack appetite I developed.  \n\nThe staff was friendly & fast, attentive to our dwindling water glasses and clearing plates quickly.  We were more than pleased with the meal, hospitality and price point--happy to walk a little of this hearty breakfast off, on the way back to the hotel.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Just got home from eating at Matt's Big Breakfast. Waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated which wasn't too bad. However, after trying the food, I don't think it would be worth it to wait beyond 15 minutes especially during the summer months to eat here. \nTo start, the menu is a little too small and was missing some key breakfast essentials I thought. Biscuits and gravy... Hello? Anyways, I decided on the chick and chop meal with hash browns, over easy eggs, and sourdough toast. The chop was really dry and tough and at times, flavorless. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns, though really greasy, were some of the best I have ever had. The toast didn't taste much like sourdough to me but the home made peach preserves were pretty legit. My husband on the other hand liked the toast. I also ordered a small fresh squeezed OJ. Maybe its just me but I almost felt I would have rather had something from a bottle. Something just didn't taste right to me about the OJ. Lots of pulp, so if you like to chew your OJ, then you might enjoy it. The husband opted for the special: 3 meat scramble with cheese and fresh jalapeno's, hash browns, and tortilla. He said it was alright but was a little weirded out that one of the meats was bologna. \nAll in all, the prices were not too bad. We felt they were a little skimpier on their portions than other places particularly with the amount of hash browns and the toast. For a place calling itself "big breakfast," I guess I expected more. Would we go back? Being that we are from Maricopa, this is pretty far for us to travel for breakfast so probably not anytime soon. The wait that is almost always present also doesn't seem worth it for a place that had nothing memorable to me other than their hash browns and peach preserves. Maybe if we are in the area and its not summer though...
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Best waffle ever! Cute atmosphere, you can tell he loves what he does! Good job, Matt
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ribeye Steak and Eggs... Best Breakfast in 15 years of traveling.  Be prepared for a bit of a wait.  Great service!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place is the real deal. Awesome portions and variety. I literally spent over an hour eating here because I had to savor each and every bite of the deliciousness
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I really don't understand what people are ordering that they say that the serving sizes here are small. My meal came with a pork chop, 2 eggs, and hash browns, which I could barely keep all on my plate (it was so much food) and a side of thick sourdough toast (2 slices). Mike ordered the fives pot which was just a sandwich. Considering we had waited almost an hour for breakfast we also ordered a side of bacon (so yummy!) and one pancake so we could try a few other things. The people sitting next to me at the counter ordered the special omelet which also took up the whole plate. \n\nThis place is so tiny. There were three tables in the main eating area (which could seat 2-3 each), 6 seats at the counter, 3 more seats in the side room at a counter and two spaces where they could seat parties of about 4-5. \n\nAlthough it took quite some time just to get in (and you have to wait outside to be called, keep this in mind if  you are there on a cold day) it doesn't take very long to get your food. It took 10-15 minutes to get our food. By the time we finished they had already turned over all of the tables. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and the food was good. My pork chop was juicy and I loved the hash browns and bacon. Mike's five spot wasn't as tasty. The eggs were overcooked and a bit dry. He wished he would have had the pancakes instead. \n\nThey have some good eats.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We have heard of Matt's Big Breakfast  many times since moving out here to Phoenix. Our family from other states have heard of this place as it has been featured on Travel Channel & Food Network. So we finally decided to give this place a try to see what the big deal was all about.\n\nMatt's actually moved down the street from their original location, which I had heard was very small. The new location which did appear much bigger, still had a long wait out side. There were a few benches that patrons can sit on & orange flavored water was offered outside for those waiting. \n\nThere was approx a 45min for out party of 4. Good thing we didn't come hungry. Once inside we were offered Bar seating, otherwise the wait would have been at least another 20 min. In my opinion, the bar stools were very slippery, or maybe it was just mine. I was wearing jeans, but I felt like I has to keep one leg on the ground in order not to slide off. & i'm kinda short so I was basically standing at the bar to eat.\n\nDefinitely a busy Breakfast spot. They state they use local resources & organic foods. \n\nThe food was tasty. I ordered the griddle cakes & they were BIG. I had to ask for more syrup which they said they would charge us another $1.50 for. \n\nNo one in our party was able to finish what we had ordered. We left with very full bellies. \n\nStill not quite sure what all the hype is about. The act of supporting Small Business?Yes, we will always try to do that. Or maybe I just needed to order something more adventurous?  Know you must come with a BIG stomach, but not hungry, because the wait is ridiculous. At least we can cross this place off of our Food Bucket list\n\nHappy Eating
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Beginning the day as I do most, with a morning run well before the sun is up, the first stop on this 6-stop tour would be downtown - a place I've now discovered to be devoid of most signs of human life on a Saturday...except for a small parcel of land at 801 North 1st Street entitled "Matt's Big Breakfast" where a line of thirty or so was already waiting for the approximately 20 seats inside.  Having heard of the nearly decade old establishment owned and operated by Matt Pool during my first visit to Phoenix but unable to make it downtown before ten on any day during that trip (when lines reportedly top two hours despite triple digit temperatures) I have to admit that I really had not anticipated the line to be so long at 6:55am and for a moment I contemplated heading elsewhere, but with my books in hand and nothing better to do my curiosity won out and I added my name to the paper list and took a seat in the rapidly dissipating shade.\n\nSitting and reading while a pair of ASU students talked about having seen Matt's on (presumably a repeat) of Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins the previous night I tried to ignore them (and Guy Fiere's existence in general) while a few people trickled out of the restaurant and with my name at least ten parties down on the list I was surprised when it was called - the solo diner benefit, it seems, landing me an end seat on the counter only fifteen minutes after I arrived and given the expedient service at Matt's a fortuitous happening that had me leaving the restaurant before the aforementioned students had even entered the doors.\n\nSeated at the counter with a menu I'd already memorized in hand and a daily special that held little interest I perused the interior - small, stark, but efficient and exceptionally clean - before my server filled my water glass, offered me coffee, and fielded a pair of questions prior to taking my order and handing it over to the kitchen less than five feet away.  With the space tight and my location literally on the verge of the kitchen and the pass it would not be long before my coffee was filled - a single pour that I subsequently sent back due to a combination of thin mouth-feel, acrid flavor, and no artificial sweetener - and even less time before my stool would be bumped into for the first of thirty times...to say the least this is not a place I'd choose to linger.\n\nSeated and watching the action of the kitchen as plate after plate came through the window and regular after regular chatted with Matt's wife at the cash register it would not be long before my order would arrive and with the restaurant's strong dedication to local/organic/fresh sourcing the items that were presented quickly made me realize why so many people deal with long waits and less-than-comfortable seating to experience Matt's Big Breakfast - the food is really quite excellent, beginning first with a perfect hotcake served with pure maple syrup and far too much (or perhaps just the right amount of) butter for $2.75.\n\nMoving from the dainty golden flapjack to something more substantial, my second dish would actually consist of two plates and four items in the form of "The Chop & Chick" - an $8.95 breakfast comprised of a Pan Seared Iowa Pork Rib Chop with 2 Poached Eggs, Hash Browns, and Whole grain Toast with Blueberry Rhubarb Jam.  Apparently their most 'famous' dish it is a little difficult to decide which aspect of the plate was the best considering the quality of perfectly poached eggs (something even good restaurants tend to overcook,) crisp yet buttery potatoes and lightly herbed juicy pork chop but in the end I think I would have to give the nod to the toast - hand cut thick, rife with seeds and a rich earthiness, and topped with house made preserves featuring what seemed to be no sugar at all but rather the essence of blueberries with a slight savoriness from the rhubarb...a strong contender for best jam/preserves I've ever encountered and reason enough to revisit Matt's when it moves to its new digs a few doors down (and hopefully decreases wait times and seat bumps...and perhaps finds a coffee roaster whose beans better compliment the quality of the food.)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The service and the coffee were absolutely excellent. The preserves and ham were tasty, as well. Their use of local produce and ingredients is a plus. However, the menu is limited and overall, our selections were merely good - not great. Our rosemary potatoes were under cooked and the eggs were far too runny. I would have understood this had it been busy, but it was just after noon and the cook was not overburdened at all. I would go back if the wait is a few minutes, but I would never stand around for a half hour plus for a table.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Here with friends. 1:10 wait, YES the new bigger place. But worth the wait. Pancakes Excellent, Omlette fantastic!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	While waiting outside, the fresh smell of BACON & waffles are waffling thru the air on the patio. There's a bird whistling a happy tune while the patrons come in and out of this small red brick building. When you cross the threshold to the other side, you are greeted the the diner atmosphere to the smell of fresh bacon.\n\nFreshly squeezed OJ & lemonade are on the menu w/ the freshest ingredients known to man kind.. Hence due to the caption on the back of the menu with the smell of waffle & bacon waffling around my senses. \n\n-Did I mention the smell of bacon? ..probably Ooh three or four times already. That's how good it smells while tantalizing my sense of smell.\n\nI can't wait to get in the door to the kingdom that's is Matt's.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	First off, lemme just say that this review reflects neither on the quality of the food (fresh) or the service (excellent).  But seriously, I've had better.  Contrary to other reviewers, Guy Fieri is not the savant of Flavortown the Food Network makes him out to be.\n\nMom really wanted to try this place, particularly the "Chop and Chick" porkchop and eggs dish that Guy had on DDD here and the reason his face is tie-dyed sprayed on the wall with the words "Guy Ate Here".  We altered our exit strategy from the Armpit of America (aka Phoenix - 120 degrees at 8am, no sir!) just to sample this mythically delicious dish.\n\nThe parking lot is the size of a postage stamp, and while there are several sizable parking lots nearby, you can't park there because it's private property and Phoenix PD don't mess around.  Which leaves metered parking along the streets.  a quarter earns you 10 minutes at Matt's Big Breakfast, and the wait time is about fifty cents on a good day.  You sign your party up on the list near a ceramic pig by the door.\n\nThe restaurant itself is exceedingly small.  Get to know your neighbors, you'll definitely be talking to them at some point in your meal.\n\nI had the organic chocolate milk which tasted exactly like the kind I have at home, an omelet with no special ingredients to set it apart from a Denny's omelet and Belgian waffles that weren't much better than the kind I buy frozen at Costco.  The menu at this Matt's location (I was told there are three around the Phoenix area, each with a more expansive menu than this location) is very limited and the ingredients are too.  No substituting fresh fruit, they don't have any.  That Chop and Chick that cost us $3.00 in metered parking?  I doubt Mom would have given it 2 stars.  Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but it wasn't something I'd do again.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What's there to say that hasn't already been said? Great, hearty food that sticks to the basics and very good service. \n\nIf there is a special of the day - get it. You wont regret it.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Hmmmmm, another place I heard about for years. Movie stars love it! Locals love it! Food critics love it! I am not a breakfast food eater for breakfast so I figured I would never try it. Hey, I am OK with Denny's or McDonalds for Breakfast! I knew I had to go when the gentleman sitting next to me on the plane recently told me that he purposely landed a layover in Phx just to try the darn place. ( I am like," Really"? But then I thought I might do the same over a great NY pizza sooooooooo I cut the guy some slack-lol) So when I found myself Downtown yesterday I stopped by. Ok, right away I had issues. Nowhere to park. I found a spot on the street and paid 2 bucks for metered parking.( And worried about a break in since the neighborhood is real bad)  We are not starting off well. I then walked the two blocks to the restaurant. Being 10:30 am on a Tuesday I figured the normal 1-2 hour wait would not apply to me, yet the place was not dead. ( Hmmmm, good sign in today's economy) I had to sit outside for a little while but the wait was less than 10 minutes and the woman who worked there was very nice.                                                                                                              The place is an old dive. Now don't get me wrong I love old buildings. Super fan of Coronado Cafe, Teeter house, and other old houses renovated into eating establishments but this place is not one of those. Frankly, it is pretty gross. Small and old looking with uneven floors. It only has 6 tables  or so and a tiny bar. No wonder the wait. The menu only has 6 things on the Brkfst side and 5 or so on the lunch side. I ordered a Salami Scrambled Egg plate with Rosemary potatoes.Maybe I  am not an EGGSpert so I couldn't tell what the big deal was and why they are quoted as being so much better than elsewhere. Now, they are cage free eggs and cooked in butter. They tasted good but I didn't like have a heart attack or moaning fit over them or anything. The Rosemary Potatoes were good but nothing I would wait in line hours for. I have had better. The coffee tasted average. Now, the bread was a different story YUMMERS! Smashing! I asked them if it was homemade and they said they get it at Wildflower Bakery. Soooo I am thinking to myself there are plenty of those in town. I will just go there next time. No wait or parking issues. I ordered an egg salad sandwich to go. Which was delish, BTW and the Homemade Mac salad was outstanding. So, my foodie fingers type, What's the big deal? Did I order the wrong thing? Why the fuss? What am I missing here?  It was very good I agree but Oprah and Guy Fierro????? REALLY? The service was fine. Everyone was nice.  I did go off hours so small wait. I honestly don't know how it made the Food Channel or why people wait three hours in the heat to eat here.  \n   I would go back sure but if I had never heard of the place I wouldn't have ranked it even in the top 100 of my favorite dining experiences.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	When I am in the mood for an omelet, hash browns and sourdough, this is my new go-to place! I don't care that I live 45 minutes away, and frankly, I don't care about the wait either!  MBB is worth every penny! So the place is really a hole in the wall, and it is noisy at full capacity. I haven't gotten out of a sit-down breakfast joint with even mediocre omelets and terrible coffee for less than $25.00 for two, but at MBB, we hit the jackpot! Here, I got a fluffy omelet with mushrooms (not from a can) and a mound of cheddar cheese, cooked perfectly (and I didn't even have to ask for it on the soft side), along with a heaping portion of the best tasting hash browns (fully cooked and not part raw)! And the sourdough toast . . . at least an inch thick, already buttered -- yes, buttered -- with homemade strawberry jam on the side. And, did I mention how great the coffee is, and within about four sips, they are there to give you a refill without having to wave them down?\n\nEveryone was so nice, from the nice young man who seated us, to the two (or three) waitresses that alternately handled our table (one took our order, two refilled our coffee, another took our bill). Service was top-notch! I can't think of any restaurant in our area of North Scottsdale that is even close to being this good! Especially for the price!\n\nWhen our waitress asked if she could get us anything else, I said, "another Matt's Big Breakfast . . . in North Scottsdale!"  I've already started coming up with a list of things we have to do in Phoenix so that we can go back to Matt's again!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	stopped in again last sunday before picking someone up at the airport. breakfast was flawless (again). i had the hog and chick this time and was very happy. hashbrowns were crispy, but not burnt. eggs were scrambled and fluffy. the jam of the day was strawberry, and some of the best i have ever had. love me some sourdough toast & jam. i waited less than 5 minutes ( it was only me), sat at the bar, and enjoyed swift, friendly service. coffee was fine but not great. if matt's is going to improve, i say the coffee is where to start.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The food at Matt's was delicious!  Went there on Thursday and got there around 10 and only waited 5 minutes.  I had the pork chop which comes with eggs, potatoes, and toast.  My son had the waffle with bacon. I also ordered a side of bacon so I could try it as we'll.  It was all delicious.  The food was very flavorful and well seasoned.  My son is 10 years old and is a picky eater.  He loved the waffle and ate almost his whole plate.\n\nI will definitely be back!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's Big Breakfast? \n\nI'd say the only thing big about this place is the wait. When you walk up to the tiny place (it looks like a miniature brick block that you're not sure is big enough for humans), you scrawl your name down on a standard piece of notebook paper... and then you wait. Not fifteen minutes. Not twenty. More like 60. At least they have free water outside because, let's face, even in October, the Phoenix sun can be brutal.\n\nPeaking inside, you realize why there's such a wait: about 8 tables (most seat 2 or 4) and about 5 stools at the breakfast bar. It's no wonder... If you do the math, the average person takes about 30-45 minutes to eat breakfast. So, add the ordering time... the cooking time... the debit card time... And you have about an average of an hour per meal. The odds are against you.\n\nBut, you put your name down, so you might as well suck it up. It's going to be a BIG wait for Matt's Breakfast. So, it's no wonder the food gets such great reviews. You're ravenous by the time your name is called -- you'd eat the fake flowers if you could away with it. \n\nCoffee is meh. At least they bring ya real cream. That's awesome. \n\nThe decor is minimal. It's said the color orange makes one feel hungrier. I really don't think Matt needs to worry about his patrons being hungry by the time they sit down to eat. Again, the wait is BIG. \n\nBut, I'll stop whining about that. Moving on... \n\nI ordered the daily special - a scramble with mushrooms and fotini cheese. It came with home fries and two wedges of cinnamon raisin bread. It looked very good when it arrived. One bite of the scramble and I thought, "I could have made this." The home fries were bland... nothing like Kerby Lane's in Austin, Texas (if you've ever been, you know what I'm talking about... please, somebody wipe the drool from my face...). The redeeming piece was the bread. Granted, it's not the best bread I've had, but it was pretty yummy. I made sure to finish all that off, but I left 1/2 my scramble and all but a couple bites of my home fries behind. \n\nAs for the service, is was above average. Not extraordinary, like I somehow expected from a place like this that boasts the cozy feel of eating among friends. The service was prompt, though, and the people working were friendly and seemed to be in a chipper mood -- that's hard to imagine when you've been on your feet since before 6 a.m. with a consistent rush. One of the cute waitresses even made people outside laugh with, "We accept all kinds of payment. Cash. Credit. Check. Or you can work in the kitchen for a little bit." I thought her happy-go-lucky attitude was a breath of fresh air. \n\nIn conclusion... \n\nWalking away from the tiny place, I commented, "I'm pretty sure I won't be going back there." \n\nFrom all the great reviews I've read, I had to try this place. I'm glad I did... it was definitely an experience, especially since the police showed up to deal with some next door squabble/drug bust/whoknowswhat. At least while I was waiting, I had free entertainment to occupy my time.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	tasty pasty!  \n\nmy favorite part of my experience was the butter and the jam. DEEELISSHHHH. \n\ni could hardly make a dent in my pancakes but I couldn't just let that butter go to waste, so i put the rest of the butter on a piece of pancake and ate that. it would have been weird if i just ate the butter, but i would have. I got the rest to go and asked for extra butter to come along with it. I think the pancakes were amazing, but it could have just been that butter. \n\nI must have thought I hadn't eaten in years bc I also ordered the bacon which is the best bacon i've ever had. let's add that to my list of best part. bacon, strawberry jam, and butter. healthy eating at it's finest. \n\nI also had the homefries but they needed salt and didn't go well w the ketchup they are served with. \n\nI would go back and order strawberry jam toast,  mountain of butter, and 12 slices of bacon.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Waited 30 mins to find out the girl was skipping me on the waiting list. She said she wasn't skipping me, that there were places for two people to sit, but not one. The last time I checked, one person is able to sit where two people can sit. I don't give a pretty fuck that you are trying to turn more tables, if I am waiting 30 mins, when it's my turn, ITS MY TURN. If someone that came after me, sits before I do, you are skipping me. There is no arguing with me about it. Won't be back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	OMG, you must be kidding and this place is in business?? so i have heard of Big Matts and wanted to try it. This afternoon i went their for the first time and what a JOKE. first of all i arrived at 12:15 PM and the front door was locked. I asked couple of men that were standing outside how to you get in this place and they told me from the front door, which i was standing in front of. So i knocked on the door and the server opened the door. My first thought is to the owner, dont be cheap and just go ahead and get a real lock for the front door. Then I asked servers where the bathroom was? she told me they dont have one, however they share one with the hotel next door. (this is not a Hilton by the way). I asked i just want to wash my hands. She told me they had hand sanitizer up front. so i used it . I understand the place is small, however, there is health requirement and I am not sure how they pass this. I believe the employees would wash their hands more then once a day. CAUTION!!!! HEALTH. \n\nFood. the server was nice and took my order. I asked for their best item on the menu and she highly recommended the daily special. Okay that is what i will get. I got two scrambled eggs, fresh motezzerla, sausage (disgusting) and sweet peppers, this was served with home potato's and toast. how bad can the eggs be, the sausage was uneatable, the potato's were full of Rosemary, and ONE slice of toast for $ 8.95. I have been to numerous breakfast restaurant  and never remember being served ONE slice of toast. Please dont be cheap for $ 8.95 you can serve two slice of toast. \nI am not sure what the hype is about this place, i will never go there. if you want breakfast go somewhere else like "the breakfast club".
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Yes, you have to wait a long time to eat here... I came to Matt's on a Saturday with a friend and we waitedddddddd, but boy was it worth it. It could just be that I was just THAT hungry and anything I ate at that point was going to be amazing, but I'd like to think it was because the food wasn't some greasy no flavor mess you get at iHOP or god forbid...Denny's. They use fresh ingredients and they have REAL butter on their pancakes and waffles!!!! btw...the waffles are like....how do I put this?.... Waffle heaven! When they offer you the home fries or the hash browns, say home fries! and I only say that because I have not tasted the hash browns and I think the home fries are amazing! The home fries are potatoes made in buttery goodness, rosemary, and onions (not over-onion-baring at all). The freshly squeezed orange juice is tiny but it is sooo worth the $2.50 for those exquisite 6 sips! Staff was very attentive and friendly, the hostess was apologizing to everyone for the wait... and I think she really meant it :)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place is fantastic.\n\nAbout the restaurant itself.  It's right by downtown Phoenix, and in fact right next to a Light Rail stop--so keep this in mind, parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily, if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option.  The place is seriously tiny, only about 6-8 groups of people can be seated at one time.  A slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating, which, given the predictably large lines even on weekdays, is a problem.  The Phoenix sun will make a 45 minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait.\n\nNow about the service.  I've always had a good experience with the people who work here.  The first time I came here, apparently one of the owners saw that I looked lost, because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated, where I can go to get coffee in the meantime.  She even suggested I leave my cell phone number and she'll call me when my seat is ready, in case I'm shopping for example.  The waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging, and they're always smiling, which for some reason makes the experience so much better.\n\nNow for the best part.  I swear, they put crack in their food, because although their breakfast options are simple, they are out of this world.  The first time I came here I got the waffles.  Perhaps it's because they use REAL maple syrup, or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown, but they make the best waffles I've ever had.  I don't even know how one makes a good waffle really, it seems pretty formulaic, but it's stellar.  I ordered it with bacon, which was also wonderful--the bacon used was the good stuff, not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket.  Every bite is spectacular, and when you're done, you're full, but not the kind of full you'll often get at breakfast joints where you think you're going to explode or take a nap--full, but refreshed.\n\nThe second time I came I got the pancakes.  Not the best pancake I've ever had, but still, superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof.  The third time I went I got the waffle again (see above).\n\nBefore I came here, I was excited about leaving Phoenix for New York due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city.  Now I'm worried there won't be anything as good!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	So for being featured on DDD, I expected a little more than what I got to be honest.  We arrived on a Sunday morning at 8:15 and waited a half hour, which I was fully expecting from the other reviews.  I was underwhelmed by the limited menu but understand that it has to be that way to turn the tables as fast as they need to in order to accommodate the crowd waiting outside.  My omelet was alright and my husband got the salami scramble which he did enjoy.  The sourdough toast, homemade jam and fragrant squeezed OJ was what I enjoyed the most.  I would recommend to visitors but honestly don't know if I would continue to come here and wait as a regular.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My husband came to my work to have lunch with me the other day and being how all I hear about in this area is Matt's, I decided we would go try it. So we pulled up outside and found a parking spot, WOOHOO!! (there seemed to be limited spaces unless you want to meter it) I looked at the outside and was again scared of the size (I really do have claustrophobia) but decided I was going in! It was VERY small but we got a table in the "back room" which cracked me up because there is this really small step to get to it and all the workers' kept saying "watch your step", it was just really funny. \n\nSo, I had the cheese omelet and home potatoes with bacon. It was delicious! My husband had the salami and egg scramble with hash browns and LOVED it! This is our new favorite breakfast spot! The only bad thing was the restroom which has been mentioned in other reviews, it's next door at the motel which is not so desirable so go to the bathroom before you go to Matt's and everything should be fine. The service was excellent and I will definitely be back, oh and no wait! It must have been my lucky day!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	100% love this place. I've been three times, all when passing through Phoenix, and I will be surely sorry if this place ever changes. I appreciate their choice to use fresh, wholesome ingredients, and their food is delicious. Amazing hash browns, fresh juice, homemade preserves, great bread! Everything is tops. The only bummer is that it's always packed, but I don't hold that against them.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'm sure you're asking how good can breakfast be? At Matt's it's the little things that count. Instead of giving you a piece of bread from a bag they give you a huge piece of fresh baked bread with real butter and homemade preserves. The organic eggs they use to make breakfast taste amazing and the syrup here puts Aunt Jemima to shame! Want to avoid the horrible wait everyone talks about? At Matt's the early bird gets the worm. Arrive between 6am-8am and you won't have to wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This is such a cool little place, just about hidden in a little building in a crappy part of downtown Phoenix. It is one of those tiny little diners, with GREAT food. I am so happy one of my co-workers convinced me to try it out. Expect a wait if you go during peak hours. The simplicity of the menu, and the great food it worth the wait though.\n\nNot sure why some of you had such a bad experience... Maybe it's because you went in the summer, I would venture to say that any place that small and that busy would suck in the heat.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Very delicious food! Very quaint atmosphere!  Super busy, so prepare to wait at least 30 minutes.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Been here twice ...and both times were worth the wait.  It is a tiny little place with nice, genuine staffers.\n\nBoth times I ordered their specials of the day...and both times...YUM!! One was a scramble with Anaheim chilies in it....delish!  The potatoes were scrumptious too!!\n\nDo yourself a favor and check it out...if you can...go during the week...weekend waits can be pretty long!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Such incredible breakfast! It loses one star because of the waiting time, expect to wait an hour, but the farmers market is across the street on Saturday so just tell them you'll be there when you put in your name and problem solved! Pancakes are huge and delicious and everything else is up to par :)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I was in phoenix on business and im allways looking for some good eats , I found this place with the help of yelp and food network app on my i phone . \nI originally planned on getting the waffle that everyone raved about , but ended up getting the Special Andouille sausage scramble ( spicy!) but very good . Hash Browns were good and i also liked the sour dough toast . \nWhen i go back im definatly gonna try the waffle \nBe ready to wait for a seat , it doesnt seem very big . \nSingles get seated faster because they have counter style seating
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place is always on wait, but well worth your time. After being discovered by Diners, Drive in and Dives, this place is jam packed. I love their pancakes and peppered bacon. MMM...my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Yum!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Oh my god. My first experience at MBB was on Good Friday, and it made it an Awesome Friday. The bacon was one of the more memorable things. Thick and cooked perfectly. Oh! And that delicious Honey Lemonade. Such a quaint little spot. Cute, small restaurant makes it feel small-town. The wait wasn't too bad either, but, I haven't been on the weekend yet. \nCan't wait to go again!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I don't normally like to share reviews without giving some critique for improvement. So... Matt's Big Breakfast- amazing food, delicious, flavorful. My girlfriend and I went suedo-hungry, the wait as we knew and expected was long and limited with seating, but totally worth it. Blythe time western sat, very hungry. We tore over the menu and order the Five Spot sandwich and the special. Both of us agreed we've never had a more delicious breakfast! Honestly was expecting a little letdown, but didn't. Awesome spot, will recommend to anyone with taste buds and time to relax. No wonder Guy Fieri came here!!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My dad and I went there for Breakfast.  It is a little hole in the wall joint which only seats about 15 people.  The prices are high for the amount of Food.  Three pancakes were $8.00 and they were not big at all less than half the plate.  My dad had a bowl of oatmeal which cost $5.50.  I was not impressed the food was just average nothing to rave about.  Also there is no parking except on the street which has meters and no bathroom you have to go to the hotel next door which has a bathroom.  It is very cramped and hardly any room.  I was impressed they had organic milk on the menu but beside this the food was just average.  I suggest not to make a special trip unless you're a DDD person and want to experience it like most of the customers were when we were there.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	One of a good reason to not judge first appearance. When my friends took me for brunch to Matt's Big Breakfast, I'm questioning her option, but since we were near this place, I agreed to try this place out. I ordered The Chick and The Chop, they gave option of eggs and I choose my fav scramble eggs. Fries or hashbrown, I choose the fries. And last time to choose my bread. Whole wheat it is! My best option for breakfast drink is always OJ so I ordered one. The OJ came, freshly pure orange juice served in a small cute cup with chicken logos. It was superb! Although the cup is small and I swore I can chug the OJ in 3secs but it still worth it! The porkchop was excellent! My whole wheat bread was thick and tasty! My scrambled eggs and fries were perfect! And last but not least, the additional bacon that I ordered was great! The only complaint that I have for this place is just the service. My waitress was too busy talking with 2 college guys customer that over-flirt her so she forgot we already gave her our card and wait for almost 45 minutes just to finish the payment. Overall, I will definitely be back for my superb breakfast but hopefully I will get a fast service next time ;))
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	IT WAS AMAZING. My friends and I were on a road trip to the Grand Canyon and also visiting a friend in the area, so we decided to stop by this place. It was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-In's and Dives and definitely worth every minute of it! \n\nWe got their daily special - spicy chirizo sausages with eggs, jalapeños and with hash browns on the side. The food came out pretty quickly and it was just perfect. The fresh jalapeños added a slight kick but the spiciness did not overwhelm the taste of the sausages. The eggs that were scrambled in with the meat was perfectly light and fluffy. Their hashbrowns were fried with butter, so it tasted a bit different from your typical hashbrowns. I am not a huge fan of butter fried anything, so I didn't really care for it, but my friends all LOVED it.  One of my friends got the waffles with a strip of bacon, and the bacon was thick and crispy, cooked just right. Also, don't forget about the coffee! It's delicious - not too acidic like Starbucks, just the way I like it. \n\nThe decor in the restaurant is also very cute - bright yellow doors, retro looking posters on the walls, a small traditional diner like table sectioning off one of the corners. All of our servers were super friendly and made the entire experience a blast. If you are in the area, it's definitely a place you have to check out!!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I have been to hash brown heaven. When I order hash browns I usually have to specify that I want them extra crispy otherwise I get a lump of anemic grated potato.  Not at Matt's.  They know what kind of hash browns this girl likes - a good crispy crust with a creamy almost mashed potato-like interior.  \n\nI also ordered the waffle and bacon.  The waffle was light and fluffy and very tasty with the real maple syrup.  The bacon was thick cut and had a delicious peppery exterior.  \n\nNow, if only I could get them to open one up in San Francisco.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I will not be back. \n\nYes, the food is very very good... but it is not the best breakfast I've ever had. \n\nWe waited outside for an hour.  There are only two umbrellas for shade and this morning, there was no water in the jug.    \n\nThe service could not have been worse--everyone seemed slow and apathetic. \n\nWhen we were finally seated, we were placed on stools in the window where tourists were taking pictures of us eating/the inside.  If you need to use the restroom, they send you to the hotel next door.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I don't know what people expect from a "diner".  I took my parents there this week and both of them loved it.  This is not some "health food" place for the Birkenstock crowd.  This is traditional diner fare.  Greasy yes, and good.  My Father had the omelet with the hash browns and he loved it.  He even commented on how good the hashies were due to the fact they were slathered in butter/fat.  My mother had the pancakes and she loved them too.  They have corn meal in them which might not appeal to a "traditionalist", but they were very good nonetheless.  I had the Belgian waffle and it was very good too.  \n\nThe coffee was typical diner fare as well.  I would not call it drek as I am a coffee snob and roast green beans at home.  The coffee was what I expected from a diner.  We went at 8AM on a Tuesday and walked right in.  The staff was friendly and prompt.  \n\nI would go again with no problem.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The service sucks at Matt's. Unfortunately for those of us that like good food AND good service the food is crave worthy- better than any breakfast I have ever had, so simple and so, so, yummy. That being said, I have never been to a restaurant that ran out of cream for coffee. Not only that but they made it seem like no big deal, no apologies. I had one too many bad experiences and have not been back since. I have been tempted many a time to go back and see if they have changed their evil ways, but I just can't bring myself to do it. We'll see- life is too short to hold grudges, especially when good food is involved, right?\n\nUPDATE: Ok, we ventured back to Matt's to celebrate my birthday in April and I have to say that the service wasn't bad at all.... no more snotty waitresses, so I am adding 2 more stars. If they would make the effort to be really friendly they would get my 5th star... but I won't hold my breath, I think it is just not that kind of place. Now if you really are a thrill seeker I have a challenge for you... go to the bathroom at Matt's (go ahead and ask them where the bathroom is and you will see what I mean)... and if you want to have a good laugh imagine a nine months pregnant woman trying to go to the bathroom at Matt's... yeah, that was fun, luckily I escaped with little more than a pinch on the thigh from the toilet seat... but unless you have a death wish you should definitely empty your bladder BEFORE you go to Matt's...fair warning.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	i have tried three times on weekends to get in here, usually not in top form, i may have thrown up the parking lot once...sorry.\nbut on a sunny thursday morning i manged to get in without much fuss.\n\nusually the fussiness is outside, oh! there is shade now jane l. this makes sense because summer is ovah...duh. so anywho...screaming tots a go go. this is a tiny place...why would you bring your spawn here? i hear tell ihop has balloon animals? maybe you could have them fashion  an anchor shaped balloon creation to match your tattoo flash inspired t-shirt? \n\nthe choices here are slim but the portions are large as well as the amount of grease. hey i like grease...but like red grease dripping out of the back end of my burrito at 4 a.m. because in the gleaming light of the morning it makes me feel so dirty. i had the oats, surprisingly grease free and my partner in breakfast crime had the cheese omelette. i also ordered home fries on the side, some have complained about the rosemary...mine had rosemary, but it looked like it was accidental. pretty bland and boring. the entire experience was pretty bland and boring. i don't see what all of the fuss is about, sure it's good, but it's also breakfast...how hard can it be?
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Met friends for breakfast this morning and was sadly disappointed.  I expected the 30 minute wait, but did not expect the over cooked eggs.  Now I did ask for crispy bacon and crispy hashbrowns and neither came out that way.  Maybe it was just a bad day, but I do not expect I will go back again.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We went on a Thursday around 10:30 and didn't expect a long wait... surprise, surprise, we waited an hour. Other than the wait (which was expected) the food was delicious. Everyone working at Matt's were friendly (they all say goodbye to you as you leave). I definently recommend getting the bacon as a side if it does not come as part of your meal. If you can't stand the heat, order carryout or show up later (at 11:30 there was maybe a 15 minute wait).
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I was willing to wait for 1 1/2 hour  for the best breakfast I  was reading about ... boy, I was disappointed.\n\nCON:\n*Bacon was dry .. really really dry\n*Hash brown  ... burnt on the outside soggy with butter on the inside. Don't get me wrong. I love my butter .. but that was just way too much.\n*Tables are tiny - we had 3 pple and a toddler  and they put us with a table  for 2. Please explain to me how we were suppose to eat ?\n\nPRO:\n*Matt was really nice\n*Service was great\n*The sour dough bread with blueberry jam was really good.\n\nWill I go back ?  ... No.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The best way to describe Matt's is "breakfast nirvana."  I've been going to this cheery downtown spot for weekend breakfasts and weekday lunches for around 2 years now and have never been disappointed with the food.  Small touches of quality abound: freshly-ground pork sausage patties, perfectly browned, homestyle potatoes o'brien (not of that cubed pre-frozen crap), thick-cut bread with homemade jam, and what tastes like real maple syrup for Matt's awesome pancakes.\n\nWhat keeps a breakfast enthusiast like me from hitting Matt's at each opportunity are the insane queues, especially on weekends.  The air conditioning can also be a bit sketchy at times, too, given the cramped space and swarm of humanity in there at busy times.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The place is tiny, you have to wait at list 30 minutes to the taste the most expensive small oj and very greasy breakfast! although their bacon is pretty tasty. I wish they wouldn't rush you so much.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Oh how I love a good breakfast!\n\n     My first experience at this quaint little establishment was this past weekend, my sister, her boyfriend....my girlfriend and I decided we needed a bite to eat after a looong night of celebrating....they chose to make the trek from Gilbert to our side of town...our first logical choice laying in bed with a swelling head you ask?  Of course we had to try Matt's...after all, we had been hearing for weeks about the bountiful breakfast that awaited....\n\n     I absolutely love something about a place that can make you feel as though your a tourist in your own town...and this one does it, very small inside....no waiting area except the side walk in front....you have to "sign in" on an ordering pad (cute touch in my opinion)...any how, after seeing what we were up against....I thought the worst, you know what I'm talking about....long wait!  Thankfully I was wrong, we were sat within about 10 minutes!  (Side note, I think we were a bit lucky on timing....as we left, there were a LOT more people waiting, I believe we got there around 9-9:30)\n\n     Ok....for breakfast we all tried about the same thing....."The Hog and Chick"....fancy(kind of ;) way of saying eggs and some kind of swine....anyhow, all the basics are included here...potatoes (your choice, home fries or hash brown)  I chose home fries...and let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised...with out a doubt the best I'd ever had!  Along with the potatoes there were onions and fresh rosemary....honestly the rosemary made them.  The eggs were cooked wonderfully....over easy seems like an easy fix...but its truly amazing how many times this can be a disaster.  My best friend had the ham....and let me tell ya...Nicki loves some good ham...and she got it!  \n\n     I have read some other reviews of this place....some talking of prices too steep....not sure where they were coming from, but all four of us....huge plates, soft drinks and or milk....with tip about 45 dollars...not sure I would classify that as "over the top"....not for a meal of this magnitude...maybe Denny's...but hey if you want that...you know where to go ;)\n\n     Only quark with our truly wonderful experience you ask?....we got the wrong drinks....regular instead of diet....other than that, the wait staff was cheery and funny...two things that are a must with me when I'm baby sitting a hang over.\n\nLike I said...I love a good breakfast...Matt's truly delivers!\n\nThanks Matt....I will be back, very soon!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Wife took me to breakfast this morning. My daughter told us to try this place. So here we are at around 8:30 AM and the place is busy. Had to wait about 10 minutes for a table...beats waiting an hour on the weekends. If your a twosome, you have a faster chance of getting a table.\nI had their Salami Scramble with hash browns and sour dough. My wife had the Hog & Chick with home fries and sour dough. \nThe last time I had soppresata salami was when I was a kid. The dish was great as long as you're a salami lover. It just brought back great memories as a teenager in North Beach in San Francisco eating a salami sandwich on a hard roll for lunch. \nThe hash browns were a little over cooked, but hey, they were hash browns.\nOne other thing, the sour dough was actually sliced from a loaf of sour dough bread which came with homemade jam.\nWe will return.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	besides the wait, being i am not a patient person all i can say its worth the wait  .this is my first visit the breakfast was simple but delicous bacon excellent great hash browns and thick baked bread slices and well priced oh and fab staff
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Consistently the best breakfast joint in Phoenix.\nThis place blows the competition out of the water without any pretension. The line is long but worth the wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	What a great place - small funky and right on time. I love this place - its old school charm with your mama's kind of cooking - huge portions, excellent food - sloppy joes - no way - WAY!  Not fancy - but I love the tight quaint atmosphere - reminds me of a neighbor joint in Chicago. Try it - you'll lie it! Historic area of the Phoenix Downtown area. Very reasonable - and REAL food!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The best breakfast place in Phoenix. Everytime I go i get the special.. which changes every time.. can't go wrong.... it's a long wait and small place but it's worth the wait
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'm  going to stop being such a taker, and give for once! I use Yelp along with other reputable websites to help make my dining, travel and shopping decisions and I never take the time to give back!! I know, I know....awful. I'm turning over a new leaf! Here is my first Yelp. Please don't judge. It's my first time.... Okay, here goes. So, I went to Matt's for the first time a few days ago....\n\nFood- Amazing.  Best pancakes ever! I'm not sure what the secret ingredient is but they are beyond good! Fluffy little cakes of love. I also tasted the butter burger. Very, very, yummy. If you decide to dine here make sure you try the bacon. I don't think I've ever tasted anything like it. Sweet, savory and cooked just right.\n\nThe building is very small, the wait is extra long and make sure you don't overindulge on the free refills of ice tea because there is NO BATHROOM!! The seating is cramped and the service is rushed, but the food is worth dealing with Matt's shortcomings.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's Big Breakfast is pretty yummy. I would have to agree though that a big fuss is made over this place. I have had the pancakes twice and both times they seemed dry. I think the biggest problem I have had is having a "big breakfast" and not enough to wash down my pancake the size of a UFO with. The juice is understandably "freshly squeezed" but a glass the size of a shot glass for almost 3 bucks is ridiculous. Personally I'm not one to enjoy water with a meal, which is probably your best choice so you don't end up spending your life savings on shots of OJ. They do have sodas but in a can and that's if you are an RC fan. The funny thing is I tried once to bring in a drink to help with the aid in digestion of my breakfast and they have a sign on the front door that reads "No outside beverage". Damn!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I went to Matt's the other morning for a solo breakfast before work. I was treating myself because I'd been on a gluten-free diet for over a month and that was the day I was reintroducing wheat after getting some blood drawn, and I'd been literally dreaming about waffles for weeks. \n\nDiet aside, it was such a nice, cheerful way to start my day. I'd been to Matt's before for a Sunday brunch, and we waited forever outside in the heat. This was totally different: I walked in and sat down at the counter, no wait at all, and the waitstaff is very attentive and quick. I found myself smiling out at downtown Phoenix through that big picture window before my beloved waffles had even graced my place setting. \n\nWaffles: solid. Belgian.\nBacon: thick-cut and peppered. I could have eaten 5 more slices.\nHomefries: this is what I remember as being so stand-out from my first visit, and they did not disappoint the second time. Crispy, tasty potato chunks with caramelized onions and sauteed bits of rosemary...oh yum. And they're not even made of wheat.\n\nThanks, Matt, for giving me a lovely mid-week breakfast experience.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	One of the best parts of my career is that I get to eat around. If eating were sex, I'd safely call myself a whore.\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast isn't just my favorite breakfast in Phoenix. It's quite possibly my favorite breakfast anywhere. Matt and Ernie do it right, and Phoenix is one lucky town for it.\n\nWhen I work in Phoenix, I conveniently stay just  few blocks away. On my last visit, I made it into Matt's no fewer than four out of the six days I was there.\n\nYes, you will likely wait outside if you go on the weekend. Not so much on a Tuesday, but perhaps. You never know. It's not important, though. It's so worth the wait. (weight).\n\nHaving tried a good portion of the menu, I keep coming back to the "Salami Scramble". It's one of those things you may make in your own kitchen and eat too much of when no one is looking. It's exactly what you imagine it is and, when paired with their amazing hash browns, close to perfection.  If you're feeling hungry enough, the Chop and Chick is the way to go. A delicious, well chosen pork chop with eggs. Sigh.\n\nThe quality of the food at Matt's is memorable for its flavor, temperature and love which is clearly sprinkled generously on top of every buttery bite. \n\nBig Breakfast. Big Love. Big Belly.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	A buddy of mine invited me to breakfast. Payment for fixing his computer. We meet on location and as I pull up, my friend is sitting outside and signals me to park around the back. The back parking lot was full, so I parked on 1 street, having to feed the meter. As I walk up I notice people outside waiting, so I sit on the bench next to my buddy out front for about three minutes when one of the girls calls us, we're next. The place is small and the atmosphere is loud because of the small space, but hey, this is downtown phoenix, who cares. I ordered the triple stack pancakes with a side of sunny side up eggs and a order of bacon. My buddy ordered the Pork Chop breakfast with potatoes. The food was great, all home made. The only thing that bothered me was there was no reg sugar, just brown. Next time I will have to bring my own sweet and low for the coffee. Girls are cute, service was great. I would definitely be coming back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ok so the look of the portions in the pictures are very deceptive.  The waffle and pancakes arent big as they look, however I am stuffed so I guess the waffle was big enough.  the food was very good, I thought it would be better, but I am not disappointed.  I would come back here :) the waffle was not as good as the farm and the pancakes were not as good as first watch. but thats just my opinion.  Next time I want to try some of their scrambles.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Hands down the best breakfast I have ever had! I have been here 4 or 5 times, and every meal has been wonderful. The wait is long, depending on the day, and they do not tell you the wait time. It can be up to an hour and a half. If you go on the weekend, get there early! By 9:30 there is a crowd outside. If you are able to go o a weekday, you may be able to be seated immediately. Either way, Matt's Big Breakfast is worth the wait!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Long Long Long Long Long Long Long wait, for average food. I remember saying to myself "We'll this was not worth the wait" the entire time I was eating. If I knew I could get a seat right away, I might frequent this place. Otherwise, I am not wasting my entire morning waiting on a meal that I could make at home in 1/8 the time.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The name makes my mouth water.  Matts Big Breakfast.  \nQuality food, this location will make you proud of what downtown phoenix has to offer and what is to Come.  From the vegetables to the meat selection hand picked food creates quality dishes.  \n  This location serves a  big breakfast in a small place. I look forward to seeing this place grow, do i hear patio?
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matts Big breakfast is great.  We go there frequently.  Yes it is small but isnt that part of the deal that makes Matts place special?  I think so.  They really do a great job of using every inch of the place to feed hungry patrons.  Almost always the service is quick, and typically the staff is helpful.  There has been the occasional bump in the road but we go there often and everyone can have an off day.....I will be back! \n\nIf you want a great breakfast Eat at Matts!!!!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My final meal in Phoenix, which was breakfast. This small brick place has made me famous with the name (of course) and was honored with a "Review of the day", which seems like a distant-memory ago. My first visit and first meal back then was a monumental one. Will my return to "my" breakfast place be a repeat? \n\nSome things hasn't changed much about my place. There was a little wait for a table, especially on a early weekday morning. "My place...why should I have to wait for a table?"\n\nThis time, my return back has got me ordering one of the breakfast specials, which was the Salami Scramble. For $5.95 and affordable meal too, I get three scrambled eggs mixed with Soppresata Salami with a side of Hash Browns and a pair of thick toasted Sourdough Bread with Strawberry Preserves. The crispiness of the sliced salami blended with the scramble eggs made it a tasty combination. The hash browns were tasty and a nice compliment to my meal. And the thick-ass toasted Sourbread bread with melted butter and the preserves was crunchy with a powerful explosion that can be heard all over the small diner (in a good way).\n\nMy place hasn't failed in my return. I'm always welcome to come back and dine at my breakfast place whenever I come back to Phoenix. And so, you can too.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	***300th Review***\n\nThis place is so nice, we went there twice!!!\n\nI was on my own for breakfast one morning and had read awesome things about this place. I am so glad I went!\n\nService was friendly and lightning fast!  I went with the recommendation of the server, and got the special: 3 Eggs Scrambled with Wisconsin Cheddar, Chipotle Sausage, and fresh jalapenos.  So simple and so fricken good! OMFG!  The fresh jalapenos were so spicy and yummy!  It also came with hash browns.  I know this is a simple thing, but, seriously, I've never had better hash browns in my life. I also had to order a side of bacon and am so glad I did. YUM!  Good coffee to go with all this too.  \n\n\nLater in the day, the hubby got out of his meeting early so we went to grab lunch there!!!  He loved the Reuben: its flavor, quality and quantity of meat, etc.  Had more hash browns and bacon =)  and tried the waffle. Tasty!\n\nI would go here every week if I lived here. Matt's really has a commitment to local, fresh ingredients and it shows in the food and how buy this place can get!  Am so glad I didn't have to wait for a table though...
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Best breakfast in town that I have had the pleasure to sample in Phoenix\nYou will likely have to wait a while to get in, and seating is limited.  If you take a big party, you should be ready to wait a bit longer.  The food is always done great, and they have a daily special.  The ingredients are part of the success, and they use local fresh organic ingredients in the food.  The waffle is the best on that I have ever had in my life.  The eggs and ham or bacon are mucho terrific.  My cousin is a fan of he chop and eggs, and that its two healthy pork chops with eggs and sides.  I have eaten most of the stuff on the menu, and there is only one clunker in my book.  that is the home made potato chips with lunch items.  They are a little heavy for my taste, and its would be nice to see fries with stuff like a huge butter burger.  Sample the organic lemonade, and you won't be disappointed.  The restaurant is close to the light rail, so you could go there on that, and parking is limited.  Visit Matt's BB and you will be back without a doubt.  This is the kind of place that is more old school, and if you want a lot of space and don't want to be close to your fellow diners, you might not like the dining experience.  I see more of these kinds of places popping up now in Phoenix, and it is a great trend in having a more varied palette in the dining experience beyond the huge chains that seem to dominate such new cities like Phoenix.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Again, people must understand that good things (food) come to those who wait.  Imagine if Matt's Big Breakfast seated as many as a Denny's.  They'd be forced to mass cook, quality would go down and service would suffer.  True, this place COULD be a tad bigger, but you can't discount them for being delicious and popular.\n\nThe time my wife and I went, there was only a 20 minute wait, so we strolled around downtown Phoenix, visited the local organic grocer, which I highly recommend, and the time flew by.\n\nWe sat at the bar and got the inside scoop on the place as we chatted to everyone from the busboy to the owner.  And the scoop was, they are opening a high-end organic coffee shop on 5th and McDowell or Thomas,
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	If you anticipate the wait at Matt's Big Breakfast, you'll have nothing to complain about. Put in your name, go get a coffee from Jobot, and relax. The staff is friendly and doesn't seem stressed about getting people in and out, and once you're seated and order your food, it comes out super quick. And it is fantastic. Hashbrowns have never been so glorious. Thank you Matt's, for a delicious place to start the day.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Well this was a pleasant surprise.  This place is small, a little cramped, but the food definitely makes up for it.  \n\nWhen seated, the waitress was very attentive and coffee was served almost immediately. The menu is small, but full of all the basics, along with the special of the day. \n\nMy fiance ordered the special, while I ordered the salami scramble. They are served with toast (white, wheat, sourdough, or cinnamon raisin) and potatoes (hash browns or country fried potatoes). We ordered the wheat, which was served with a chunk of butter melting between the slices and a small cup of jelly. The toast was served almost immediately after taking our order and it was full of nom noms. The service is fast and you never have to wait for a waitress to come by. There is always someone nearby to help. \n\nThe prices were very good as well. The average cost of entrees is between $4-8 dollars and the coffee has free refills. The amount of food served is just enough to fill you up with out making you feel like a glutton.\nThey don't take reservations and the place is very small with limited seating so either arrive early in the morning or expect to wait a while.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'm probably the lone dissenter in the land of Five star reviews here, but here goes. \n\nI wanted to love Matt's. It's adorable and close to home. \n\nI don't eat pork, which eliminated a good portion of the menu right off the bat. That's fine, it's not like I expect restaurants to cater to me, that's what my kitchen is for. \n\nI had the cheese omelet. It was good, but could have used some spices. The hash browns were ok, despite the fact that they were floating in their own grease. \n\nMatt's is great if you like breakfast with a bucket of grease on the side. It made me sick, so I won't be back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	On our trip to AZ we had to stop by here. We wanted to dine in, but on our way to the airport it only made sense to bring the food back to the place we were staying at since we had yet to pack. This place brings the traditional simplicity of breakfast back to the kitchen table.\n\nWe opted for the "Hog & Chick" and Griddlecakes. Both were delicious and very filling. Simple breakfast made with that home made touch. We were glad we stopped by here before we headed back home. On top of the food, the service was amazing and friendly, and the bill was not a big dent in the wallet either. Overall an amazing experience with Matt's. We will definitely be back for our next trip.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Food is great....5 stars.  The wait....1 star.  Sorry...no place is worth two hours for breakfast.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I've never eaten in but we've ordered takeout many many times from here - but the place is very small so if you're going to eat here there's usually a wait. I think it would be worth it though! This is the BEST breakfast place. Their menu is very small and they do have some "lunch" items but I will never stray from their awesome omelets! The home fries and hash browns are both delicious, and they always have a special that's super yummy.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This place under-promised and over-delivered. It was a definite whole in the wall feeling, and I'm assuming you should be prepared to wait should you go at peak hours. We went on a Friday morning and had around a 20 minute wait. The food was so fresh and the pancakes were absolutely delicious. They really up the ante on diner fare and go fresh and local. The difference is in the taste. Even the sourdough toast was homemade. Well done...and at a great price.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Nothing like a five spot sandwich after the Farmer's Market!! Still super tasty ...I don't mind the wait ... it's that tasty!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The PERFECT Breakfast :)  If only I could have this every day :)\n\nMatt's is all you want a breakfast spot to be...cute, friendly and the most amazing food out there.\n\nI highly recommend the hog and chick.  You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.  * = best ever, ever, ever\n\nI could write on and on...you've seen the reviews.  Just make sure to make it there, you won't be sorry, you'll be addicted!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I usually steer-clear of places that are rumored to have a long ass wait but my Mama selected this place for her birthday brunch, needless to say it was a yummy breakfast. We got there around 815 and were seated around 9, so if youre being leisurely, its worth the wait.\n\nThe menu is small and concise, making it somewhat easy to decide; it all looks and sounds so good. But it's all pretty basic meals with a couple of daily specials. One of which I had; scrambled eggs, jalapenos, cheese, onions, and a shit ton of delicious, partnered with home-fries and a tortilla. The jalapenos were just right and so fresh! We also had tried some of the walnut, raisin bread toast; which was fantastic. My boyfriend had the waffle which was good but I could tell he could use another one ($8 for one waffle?). I don't eat swine too often but the bacon was heavenly; thick and peppered. One thing I do regret about the meal was I saw someone order some chocolate milk, definitely should've got some instead of coffee; what's the rush to wake up on a Sunday anyway?\n\nWhen we came out, some people who had been waiting near us, were asking what we got and how it was. It seemed our leaving Matt's got everyone outside's mounths watering. Everyone lit up to hear our reviews, which I thought was pretty funny...So all-in-all it was good but nothing so amazing (which is what I've heard about this place). Great for a special occasion or once in awhile.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	If there was any place in town that is worth getting up at 6am on a Saturday to get in line for breakfast food, this is it. Everything I've had here is amazing and worth the wait as everyone else said. \n\nThe ingredients are local, the staff is friendly and the setting compact. Not a place I would try to to bring a group larger than 4 to though so if you have a large group, pick out the 3 others you like the most and ditch the rest! ;)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I feel like a douche bag for giving Matt's only 1 stars when everyone else raves about this place and the owner truly is such a delight so in my defense let me explain:\nThis place is a hot spot, every time I've tried to go there, it's packed.  Each time, I've never wanted to wait so I went on my way.\nOne Sunday, I was just down the street from them at Valley Youth Theatre watching Winnie the Pooh with my son and I thought how great it would be to take my son to this popular joint for a bit of breakfast afterward.  When we got out of the theatre, it was pouring rain in giant buckets, one of those rarities in Phoenix where you can't see what's in front of you cause it's raining so hard.  Well, we braved the rain and drove to Matt's~ 5 mins. after their posted closing time and yup, you guess it~ despite me and my 3 1/2 year old son drenched wet and  looking pleadingly at them for some warm food and a place to stay for awhile to get out of the rain, they told us they were closed and sent us on our way.  Talk about tough standards~ I guess when you are as popular as Matt's you get to make and stick by the rules you make.\nDespite that experience, I still wanted to try Matt's because of all the applaudes I've heard about the place. Finally I made it there on one of those days when I had the time for the long wait and sadly for me, I was sorely disappointed by the breakfast served to me.\nI had remembered reading some article about the BIG BREAKFAST served at Matt's and that's what I was expecting.  I ordered the waffle with bacon for $9 expecting a Denny's portion of food but with flavor and excellence.  The place was packed so I had to wait 30mins for my waffle to materialize in front of me.  When I got the one piece of waffle and one piece of bacon served to me, I thought perhaps while waiting I had accidentally swallowed Alice (in Wonderland) tonic and was now a giant looking at my rather small serving of food on my plate.  Seriously, I almost felt tears come into my eyes, I was so disappointed.  Needless to say, after trying so many times to go to Matt's and finally getting there just to have not a big breakfast but a are you kidding me?  where's the rest of my food experience, I will not go back there.  It's a good thing too cause it's far from my house and I hate waiting!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The best hamburger in Phoenix is Matt's BIG BUTTER BURGER, bar none.  Get it cooked medium and get the HASH BROWNS on the side, we like them crispy or well-done.  The meat is so tender and flavorful, it melts in your mouth, and the bun is specially prepared just for them.  Super fresh produce on the burger along with a big ole slab of American cheese makes this a burger you'll dream about later on.\nThe Griddle Cakes are our second-favorite item and when we go, we share a Burger and one order of the Cakes and we are both FULL and satisfied.  \nMatt's is truly a hole-in-the-wall, but don't let that deter you.  Figure out when the lines are short and GO, you won't regret it.\nWE LOVE THIS PLACE.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Great specials, decent service. Definitely a local hotspot. Board was not current.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	An hour wait and well worth it. This breakfast will put you into the best food coma you've ever had before noon. When you wake up at 3 pm all you'll be thinking about is the amazing bacon and fresh squeezed orange juice that put you out.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ate there this am. Waited 45 min. This is part of the culture of this place so be prepared to wait. The food was great. We had the special, extra bacon and lemonaide. this bill was 30 bucks including tip. I am a fan. If you are not a fan of the AZ heat, you may want to wait until fall to chow down. It's hot outside and hot inside. It's a tiny place with great food! The bacon is yummy and the toast is THICK sliced with homemade jam.( Didn't have coffee cuz we got it across the way while we waited for our time to eat.)
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Excellent food and service. I loved that they use all natural fresh ingredients from local farms. The place is small so get there early on the weekend if you want to avoid the wait and I don't think they have a bathroom so get that sorted before going. I was very happy with the overall experience and  I would  highly recommend a visit.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	During one of our Spring Training trips, we stopped by here for breakfast on Guy Fieri's recommendation on Diners, Driveins and Dives. The place gets packed and it's a small little area, so expect to wait at least an hour. We waited for 90 minutes before we got in on a Sat morning...\n\nWell worth the wait! Ben had their omelet scrabble special with spinach, cheese and sausage. I had a simple scrabble eggs with sausage. Obviously, I liked Ben's dish WAY better. We ordered a side of their peppered bacon, they were thick and juicy and DELICIOUS! Ben was in love with their home fries, the hint of rosemary really added to the favor. Their pancakes and french toast looked good too, but we were too stuffed to try it.\n\nWe are going back on our next Spring Training trip! Definitely a must try, but like everyone said, be prepared to wait a LONG time.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My husband had been buggin me to go.... always at least an hour wait, so I went with my sister who was visiting on vaca form LA.   only 25 minutes outside on a midweek morning about 930 ....  weather was good so that part was fine....\nI had the special, which was a pork loin benedict, and she had the hog and chick (ham and eggs).  I ordered the wrong thing for sure.    the server recommended the hashbrowns, but my husband said home fries (of course via text, after I had ordered).   the hashbrowns were DROWNED in butter.   Not a bad thing but a heart attack waiting to happen, for real.   service was great, they churned and burned us and got us in and out.   But not sure what the hype is about.  its close, but not cheap as far as diners go, so in my mind I think i would have rather just eaten at home.  \nso 3 stars, for locally grown food, good service, and a little pricey.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Coffee was good, orange juice was fresh & delicious.\n\nI had the waffle which came with bacon: OMG, my mouth was in heaven! Bacon was sooo good, covered in black pepper, and the waffle was soft and sweet and oh-so-good! \nBoyfriend had the breakfast sandwich: also very yummy.\n\nThe wait can be ridiculous. The place is pretty small, but it was very well-priced.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Food is good. Simple. Not worth the prices nor the wait. A small glass of orange juice is $2.50, which seemed a little pricey. Menu is small.\n\nHighly recommend going just to try it yourself, seeing how much fame it gets. I think they can pull it off giving that there's not many places that serve breakfast downtown.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	waited for a really long time . . . like an hour and a half.  To be honest - it wasn't all that and a bag of chips like I expected.  I mean, it was good, but I was expecting to get blown away and I didn't.  The breakfast wasn't even that big.  I had the special and I can't even remember what it was that's how unimpressed it was.\nI won't go back.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Like many others saw this place on triple D.  Have eaten here a couple of times since and have enjoyed it every time.  Go out on a limb and order some of the odd combos they have as speacials and you won't be sorry.\n\nA lot of people complain about the wait however there is one sure fire cure for it.....get up a little early and be there prior to 8am and the wait will be very short.  A group of 8 of us arrived at 745 and were in at 8am.\n\nHighly recommended!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Absolutely adore this place. Matts' serves the best breakfast in downtown Phoenix!! I usually order the special which is always amazing!!  The toast  is delicious with their organic preserves. The homefries are also yummy. I love the local vibe. The owner is always friendly,  and greeting you with a big smile! Stop by and you won't regret it! Can't wait to go back!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	So we waited for a table for an hour. in the winter. and it was windy. my hair was flying, my fingers were freezing and I was getting increasingly annoyed. why cant they expand their space just a little bit? The waitress kept running outside to check people off their list, and started handing out menus so that we could order. It took the joy of of looking at the menu and deciding what to eat. I was looking forward to a nice leisurely brunch after which we planned to go to the museum.  We would have left, except that this was downtown Phoenix and dint want to lose our parking spot. \n\nFinally, after a little more than an hour, we were seated. the place is TINY. Tables are close together and just as luck would have it, we got a table right next to the door, where every time she opened it, i was greeted with nice gush of COLD air. And people waiting outside could see us sit in the warmth and eat.\n\nThat being said, the food was excellent. I can't seem to remember names of our dishes, but the eggs were very good, with potatoes, toasted sourdough bread, orange juice and coffee.\n\nBut was the wait really worth it? I don't know! I don't think I'd want to wait for so long for a table. I'd recommend this place to friends for sure though. I think I just contradicted myself! don't get me wrong - excellent food. just that the waiting pissed me off. a lot.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I'm not quite sure anyone could do breakfast any better. \n\nWe came on a Tuesday at about 9am, after previous attempts, and were seated right away. It is definately small and there is no place to wait inside, just multiple benches outside to bask in the blaring sun. If this is the case, bring sunscreen.\n\nThere is a pad of paper, just outside the door, to write your name and total number in party down -- that is known as the wait list.\n\nDon't even try to go on a weekend, atleast in my experience.\n\nAnyway, we both ordered the "hog and chick" - it was fabulous. Although they could have cooked the eggs a bit more. The bacon was thick cut and peppered, the has browns were real potatos, the toast was also really thick cut with real butter and local preserves.\n\nThe wait staff do not hover, the owner goes around making sure everyone is doing well. It's very heart warming being here.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Yes, yes.  This place is awesome.  The other reviewers are right and have covered the details.  In order to not waste your time, I'll keep it short and simple.\n\n - Best pancakes I've ever had.\n - Bacon was quite delicious.\n - Spectacular, thick cuts of bread for the toast.\n - Yummy, homemade jam.\n - Quick and friendly service.\n - Don't forget to ask for your to-go cup of coffee.\n\nI went on a Friday morning, and we only waited 5 minutes for a table of four.  Like "they" say, this place is small so it's going to fill up quick on the weekends.  Not sure about you, but I instantly think, "What can I do to avoid the wait?"\n\nHere's my tip . . . find a reason to go out to breakfast on a weekday.  Plan a "business breakfast" with some co-workers (we do "business lunch" all the time . . . why not breakfast?).  Or pick a day when you can go in an hour or two late and have a friend meet you.  Make it a birthday breakfast for your signification other, parent, or sibling.  Whatever the reason . . . just find one!  It's a nice way to mix up the regular weekly routine with something fun and treat yourself at the same time.  \n\nAnd trust me, Matt's is worth it!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	My visit was a complete disappoinment.  I drove all the way from Scottsdale because I had heard such good things about Matt's, so I arrived hungry, and with high expectations.  \n\nThe restaurant was busy, with only counter seating available, so I took one of the available stools.  They are VERY uncomfortable metal stools.  The seats are round, unupolstered, metal, smaller than most folks butts (I am a small woman), insufficiently contoured, and very slippery. I had to pull the stool in close to the counter, wedge my knees against the counter, and keep my feet on the rungs of the stool in order not to feel as if I would slide off.  The hard metal seat was so uncomfortable that I kept looking around in to see if a table opened up.\n\nSo, uncomfortably perched, I decided to try the pork chop, eggs, hashbrowns and wheat toast.  The plated food looked good.  The eggs were fine and cooked as ordered but even after trying all 3 of the salt shakers on the counter, I couldn't get enought salt without opening the shaker, and though I am not a heavy salter, everything needed salt.  The pork chop looked appealing but turned out to be dry, overcooked, difficult to cut even with the steak knife that was provided, and tasteless (seriously),   I could see that the meat was seasoned, but I couldn't tast whatever they used.  I didn't understand the texture of the hash browns.  The top and bottom were crisp and pretty good, but the middle (which comprised most of the order) was really wet.\n\nHungry as I was, I ate some of the crispy part of the hash browns, a little of the pork chop, a couple bites of toast, and only one of the eggs because nothing appetizing remained to eat with the second one (I can't handle eggs alone).  No big breakfast at Matt's for me.  I was too disappointed to even complain about my meal.  I just paid my check and left for the treck back to Scottsdale with no plan to ever return to Matt's.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The bacon served here is something special.  However, this place not only has big breakfasts it also has big waits.  The waits are to be expected with such an establishment, but once you reach your seat... well it is not a comfortable one.  The seating is too hard and the set-up does not support a leisurely weekend breakfast with friends...  a yummy breakfast... yes... but not a leisurely one.  Nevertheless, give it a try and enjoy the bacon.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	3.5-4 stars.\nBumped up the rating because the servers were so nice considering how crazy/busy it was.\n\nSmall hole-in-the-wall breakfast place. Loved the cranberry walnut bread. Coffee was good. Had the 3 egg, mozzarella, spinach special which was good. Nicely made home fries & hash. Fast but very friendly service.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Today happens to be the first day of my Thanksgiving break, so I figured I should hit up a breakfast or lunch place that I wouldn't normally get to go to.  I read up on some of the reviews here and felt a bit unsure, as there are lots of negative ones but decided that I trust David SB, Mr. K and Pierre much more than all the naysayers.  I'm glad I did.\n\nI also, for some unexplainable reason, did not think there would be such a long wait on a random Wednesday morning.  I mean, don't people have jobs?  We ended up waiting about a half hour, which wouldn't have been bad but it also happens to be one of five days that it rains in Phoenix.  The wait was long, and both Nathan S. and I were getting close to regretting our decision.  There was great people watching though- a man running into The Coronado Hotel (that boasts an RCA electronic system and refrigeration) with a case of Natty Light, many people rushing out of Matt's to save their car from the meter police and just generally, the meter police vehicle.\n\nWe were seating and immediately served coffee which I don't usually drink.  Nathan S. assured me that this is not the kind of place with french vanilla creamer, which is sad for me, but overall a good thing and compliment to Matt's taste.\n\nI ordered the griddle cakes and a side of hash browns.  Our food arrived at different times which wasn't cool but I figure that kitchen is tiny.  It didn't take too long for his to arrive, so we just had to wait a few minutes to dig in.\n\nOne word- BUTTERTASTIC!  I am not a breakfast girl, and I attempt to eat healthy (mostly to offset the booze intake) but this was amazing.  I knew it was a very naughty breakfast, but delicious all the same.  Nathan S. also commented that the mushrooms in his omelet had definitely been marinated in butter prior to being put into the omelet, which made me like this place more.\n\nIf you are into naughty breakfasts, Matt's is your kind of place.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Amazing! Such a fun little restaurant. It adds character to downtown Phoenix and the food is great! I got the hot cakes, which were huge and tasted so free, with real butter and real maple syrup. The service was friendly and the atmosphere made me feel like I was back in time at a cute little dinner but with a modern twist. My friend had the special, which was eggs benedict and hashbrowns. Also amazing and you can tell all the ingredients are farm fresh. I'm salvating just thinking about it! The wait wasn't too bad for us. We got their right around 9am and waited for 20 minutes, ate in 40 minutes. However there was quite the line of people after us. I don't suggest going in a large group and only go if you have time for a relaxing morning, long wait but they feed you quickly- but not rushed!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	So my hubby and I found ourselves in this area and the first place on my yelp search is this one... and we may had not paid much attention to it, but it sounded like a place a friend had just mentioned a few days back so we decided to try it...\nYou know those little things that set a place apart from the others? this one is full of those! the tap water tastes good, the glasses are quaint and beautiful. The home potatoes had tasty herbs, I ordered eggs and pork chop and the pork chop seemed to have something like pesto. The Wheat bread was better than I ever had, and instead of jelly, real blueberries... I could go on and on. Yes, the place is tiny, and perhaps a little pricey, but I think it is worth it. Service was great too. And since we were there at the right time, we didn't have to wait to be seated, neither had trouble parking. Good luck and enjoy.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	There isn't much I can say that hasn't been said so I'll be fast and say stuff that possibly hasn't been addressed.\n-A big minus for me, the menu online is outdated.  Add two dollars to the price of everything.  Also the portions seemed to have shrunk a bit from whenever pictures here were taken.\n-There is only one 4-top, everything else is 2-top or counter, so plan accordingly.  We got there early and put our name on the list despite the agonizing taunt of all those empty 2-tops.  The bf was a little grumpy the waitress didn't put 2 tables together, but admitted there really wasn't room to do that without blocking a path.\n-The decor is cute and Ikea-esque.  Very clean and bright, I felt like I was in a Real Simple spread.\n-The blueberry jam tastes like normal blueberry jam.  It's cute and nice to get in a cup instead of a package, but otherwise not special.\n-I ordered bacon because everyone said the bacon was amazing, even though the sausage looked really good.  My bacon was thick-cut but burned and not particularly tasty regardless of doneness.\n-They cooked my eggs over medium!  I always ask and usually get over easy anyway.  I appreciate the effort, maybe he was concentrating and accidentally burned my bacon.\n-The home fries have a LOT of rosemary, so don't get it if you're not a big fan.  It perfumed the whole plate and the leaves soaked in the oil seeped into everything.  I liked it.\n-Don't come here if you want a quiet, private breakfast experience.  The guy sitting behind us seemed grouchy as soon as he was seated and spent the meal glaring at my in-laws, presumably for speaking loudly over the restaurant noise (like everyone else).  He made a lot of pointed throat-clearing and loud newspaper rustling that seemed to embarrass the crap out of his wife and perplex patrons around us.  I really don't know what we did, but don't be this guy.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Good breakfast. Be prepared for a wait list. Also limited parking, so you may need some coin for a parking meter down the street. Very small interior, don't bring a group. Gotta try Matt's Big Breakfast at least once.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The aptly named Big Breakfast isn't the only thing they should be famous for. The food is not only generous, its fresh. The potatoes are home made (nothing processed here) and the bread appears as if its never seen a bag in its life. \n\nThey kept the coffee coming! \n\nWe didn't wait at ALL on Tuesday at 7AM so if you work downtown, do yourself a favor and hit Matt's before work one day..you'll beat the traffic, the Saturday lines and be so full, you probably won't need much of a lunch. \n\nIn short: fresh food, tall coffee, tasty treat. Well worth it. Even with a wait.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Coming from a diner-centric middle america, I was a little underwhelmed at the limited menu at Matt's, but boy, what he does cook he does excellently. The scrambled eggs I had in my special were easy enough, and I liked the combination of the local shishito peppers, ham, and jack cheese, but the hashbrowns are a shining example of how to execute them perfectly. I wish I had the bacon, too, because that also looked outstanding. Like many of the best places in Phoenix the line grows exponentially by the hour, so get there early and prepare to wait. It's interesting to see the large amount of abandoned restaurant concepts in the surrounding area, but I don't expect Matt's will be among them anytime soon.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	This great breakfast spot is now open on Mondays too!\n\nYUM!!!!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Absolutely love this place! We chose to go to breakfast on a Tuesday and only had to wait 30 minutes for this delish meal! It was a good time to look over the menu and decide what we wanted to eat. The menu isn't big but everything looks good! Since we were only getting to try one meal at this place, I decided to go all out and get the Chop and Chick with a side of the bacon and a strawberry honey lemonade. The food was amazing. Hash browns all the way! And the bacon...oh the bacon...and the bacon! It was worth it for me to get the extra side of bacon. Did I mention the bacon? \n\nI do have a critique on the lemonade. It was a bit too sweet for my liking. So i diluted it with a bit of water and that made it just right for me. I'm going to have to try other menu items...I'm not a fan of waiting an hour, so it might have to go again during the week to avoid the much talked about morning crowds. You gotta try this place if you are in Phoenix!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	If the Chop and Chick is Guy Fieri's favorite breakfast dish, his credibility has dropped a few points.  I wanted to like it... heck, this was one of the reasons I drove out to Phoenix, but the pork chop didn't do it for me.  It was dry and there just wasn't enough pesto to grab my attention.\n \nThe hash browns saved the meal for me though.  They reminded me of the way my mom used to make them: very thinly-sliced, a little on the oily side and extremely crispy.  I can eat this forever.\n \nYes, the place is small and the wait is long, but I won't dock any points for that, even though it was in 100+ degree weather; waiting is all part of the experience.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	The food is very good at Matt's.  I usually get one of the specials.  My wife always gives me a strip of bacon from her plate, and I must say, they have excellent bacon there.  It's a nice thick cut of bacon, which is right up my alley.\n\nThe service is as it should be.  No frills, but they get the job done.  That's all I really care about.  I'm almost never in the mood for the fake banter you get from chain restaurant servers.\n\nThere is a little bit of a wait, but people who are not originally from AZ are used to waiting 2x as long, so it's not really a big deal to me.\n\nI'd eat here again.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	First time here. I've heard great things about this place since I've lived in Arizona. Let's just say, my expectations were exceeded. The bacon and toast are out of this world. Add the simplicity of the menu and the local feel to the place, and you get the best breakfast in the Valley.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	12/10/09\nFinally had the chance to take Mom in to enjoy breakfast at MBB!  I tried taking her here once, but the line out the door was ridiculous; Even today there was a bit of a wait, and it wouldn't have been so taxing if it weren't so cold!  (We arrived at 10:15a, sat down at 10:45a, and had our meals delivered at around 11:10a.  Again, the wait times wouldn't have been so bad if my Mom wasn't due to be at the airline gate at 11:40a!)\nMom ordered the 3-egg salami omelette and hash browns w/ cranberry-walnut toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=-gdeqfSkpFBnCfkRo3Lcng#-gdeqfSkpFBnCfkRo3Lcng, while I had the ham steak, hash browns, eggs (over-medium, please!), and whole-grain toast.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=OCEqJ846dKKtI2TLJ3mg5Q#OCEqJ846dKKtI2TLJ3mg5Q  (Let me just say that we both LOVED the cranberry-walnut toast!  Is it MJ bread or from Simply Bread??  I've got to get a hold of some to have at home!)  I enjoyed the ham steak and the hash browns were wonderful, as always.  Eggs are always delicious here- aren't they from local Hickman Farms?  Mom didn't enjoy her omelette so much- too much salami!  I don't like salami, but I tried a bite anyway.  Yep, I STILL don't like salami...  However, she did enjoy the eggs, after picking off most of the meat, and the bread w/ the plum jam.\nI'm always happy when my Mom enjoys herself at a restaurant that I take her to, so thank you MBB for helping her start her vacation right!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Lines, lines lines.  and the food was marginal at best.  I ordered the steak and eggs.  It was fine.  Better than Dennys, but worth the hype and wait...uh no.  I don't think so.  If you want a great breakfast/brunch/lunch without the wait at a reasonable price, head over to Gallo Blanco.  Those guys know how to get it done.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Amazing food. I travel all the way from Tucson monthly just to eat breakfast here. It's delicious. There's always great service and the food is the best. If you're in town, I'd check it out for sure!
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I am 26 years old and I've had a lot of good breakfasts, but I can honestly say this was the best breakfast I've ever had!  We waited 45 minutes at 10 am on a Sunday morning and it was SO worth the wait!  The bacon was semi-sweet, super thick, and had peppery spices on it.  The eggs were fluffy and were so good they did not need salt.  The potatoes had rosemary or lavendar or something and were amazing.  My husband had the steak, it was phenomenal, my bro and sis in law had pancakes that were the best I've ever tasted.  This meal was so good it was almost erotic.  Hubby and I slept all day after.  Eat there.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I feel kinda silly writing about a place that already has over 200+ amazing reviews, but this is the internet and goddamnit, my opinion matters. But its true.. All 200+ rave reviews are spot on... \n\nMatts. Is. The. Shit. \n\nIf it weren't for the long-ass wait in the three thousand degree AZ summer heat, I'd probably be there on a regular, but sorry dudes, I am a ginger kid, and I burn. I also have no soul, but you all already knew that.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI was skeptical for, ohhh, about a year... yes, it took me that long to actually muster up the patience to deal with the wait.. but I have very persuasive friends who have really good ideas., so last Saturday, I went, and the fact that its been almost a week since i've tasted the sweet spuds in their hashbrowns makes me want to cry. They are seriously, one of the most delicious things ive ever eaten. I got the Chop & Chick.. because i love pigs and eating them. The pork was perfect, nicely seasoned, tender and delicious. I got my eggs over medium, because egg yolk is one of my favorite things to dip shit in, and an order of home fries because the waitress said the hash browns were "kinda funky, not like usual", that day.. but she lied. or maybe she didn't, but my friend got them and either way, they were amazing. My friends got the 5 spot (breakfast sandwich thing) & the daily special (some chorizo mexicany mash up of yum), which were both equally amazing, but for real, my yolk covered pork chop superseded anything those fools were eating. Its been on my mind for days.\n\nAs usual, I drank way too much coffee, but what I should have done was order a chocolate milk like my good friend Georgie S. had.. For whatever reason, it was better than any other chocolate milk in the universe.\n\nIts small, cramped, kinda retro, no booze and there is no bathroom.. but whatever, I like places like this. its totally worth it, and did I mention its CHEAP?!\n\nGo here at least once in your life. Make sure to get the HB's and visit The Downtown Phoenix Farmers Market across the street when you're finished. Its the perfect way to start your Saturday.
-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Matt's is pretty good breakfast. I am glad that when I went we had no wait whatsoever. Not sure how we pulled that off on a beautiful Sunday morning...happy though!\n\nDefinitely overrated. No question there. However there is a certain extreme eating quality to eating at a place smaller than my living room with other guests. I might go back if i spy the line is nonexistent, otherwise...there are other places down the block that are better and you can walk right in and eat!
-0b86isaXMY0v4g-V8GZ9Q	The Knitting Tree has been THE yarn place on Monroe Street for many years. My daughter has gone there many times for help with her knitting projects over the years and the people there have always been friendly, helpful, patient and understanding with her. They have a great selection of yarn and loads of experience. If you need yarn or help with your knitting, this is your place.\n\nLocal tip: since it's street parking only, try to avoid going there during the evening rush hour as there's no parking on that side of Monroe St. then.
-0b86isaXMY0v4g-V8GZ9Q	A gem.  Great displays of sample knits.  Good books and magazines.  Quirky staff.
-0b86isaXMY0v4g-V8GZ9Q	I have to say, this shop is very cute and will fulfill the needs of any dedicated knitter.  The store clerk helped me pick out a gift, a nice book, for a friend of mine.  Unfortunately, the gift was not what my friend was looking for.  I was told later by another employee that they do not do returns on books as they have had issues with people photocopying the knitting patterns and returning the books.\n\nAfter speaking with the owner, she agreed to give me an exception after explaining the policy.  It is not likely that they are willing to do this again for anyone.  So, if any shifty knitters are reading this, SHAME!\n\nAlso, if you had read my last rating of this store, please disregard it.
-0b86isaXMY0v4g-V8GZ9Q	This is a strange place. I went to buy some yarn and asked one of the clerks for a recommendation. She told me I would have to choose a pattern and handed me a book. I already had a pattern, but she told me to pick one. I flipped through the book for a second and just picked one at random so that I could just buy some yarn. She finally helped me, but then said that I would now HAVE to buy the book, since I had used it. There's really nothing wrong with the place, but after that bizarre exchange (I refused to buy the book; she relented but seemed pissed about it), I'd prefer not to go back.
-0b86isaXMY0v4g-V8GZ9Q	Jackie and friends are the best. I am taking a class here and they are very helpful and Jackie and Patti and teaching assistant Peggy are great at teaching. Very patient. If you get frustrated and need help you are welcome to walk in. Beautiful tasteful samples to choose from. Things you would truly wear are shown in the store to tempt you to try to make for yourself . They have wonderful patterns! Thursdays they are open later and you can park in the lot across the street! They are expanding their store to a brand new spot right next door it will open in August!
-0b86isaXMY0v4g-V8GZ9Q	Love love love the Knitting Tree! Jackie and staff are very helpful. Anytime I need help with a project I sit in the store and work and they help me along. They are very encouraging too. Will order other colors of yarn for you , mine came in within the week.  There is one staff member who isn't very patient or helpful, so just ask someone else if you get her.  The new store is lovely with lots of knitted up projects throughout.
-0b86isaXMY0v4g-V8GZ9Q	Love love love this yarn shop. It's only my second time visiting the Knitting Tree, as it's a bit of a drive from MKE, but it is a lovely shop. The woman who owns the shop (she has a business partner that I've not met) is helpful and very friendly. \n\nBut the best part about this shop is the variety of yarn within its four walls -- Malabrigo, Madelinetosh, and plenty of other hand painted yarns to choose from, and in many different weights.
-0b86isaXMY0v4g-V8GZ9Q	The Knitting Tree looks so cute and inviting. Years ago, when I first started knitting, I was excited to finally get some "real" (aka: not cheap acrylic) yarn and embark on a major project. I was treated rudely and dismissively by a clerk who couldn't bother to have her personal conversation interrupted to help a customer.\n\nFlash forward a few years: I give them a 2nd chance. i ask for some help. I am ignored. I wait patiently. Finally, I am snapped at with "can I HELP you!??" and in the end I leave without a purchase.\n\nFlash forward another few years and, even though I have had bad experiences, and have seen how the mutual management has ruined Lakeside Fibers, I go in as a yarn company online notes that The Knitting Tree carries the yarn I seek. I was in search of a particular color. Not only did they not have the color, but they seemed to not have the yarn type. And that was fine. It was probably old info on the website that referred me. But the salespeople are always just so rotten and unhelpful. \n\nThree strikes: you're out. No matter how much they spruce this place up on the outside, it's like an evil beauty queen: pretty on the outside and coldhearted on the inside.
-0b86isaXMY0v4g-V8GZ9Q	I used to work at the knitting tree, way back in the 70's.  I was at Edgewood College then, and Dottie, Suzie and the gang helped me learn more about knitting than I even realized possible.  I was so happy to walk in recently ( Early Feb '09) to discover things are better than ever!  Jackie gave me the grand tour, and things were much improved since I worked there.  The selection is wonderful and the space is bright and open.  The "library" is inspiring and the pattern selection rocks.  \nThanks to Jackie and the folks there that day I felt welcomed and was so happy that I stopped in.
-0b86isaXMY0v4g-V8GZ9Q	A great selection of natural fiber yarn.\n\nHowever, they could be clearer on their policies.\n\nI went to exchange some yarn because the project I started needed less than what I anticipated. Did not think it would be a problem because the receipt clearly states that store credit would be given with a receipt within 3 months of purchase. Check, check.\n\nI go to exchange my yarn and I'm denied because "We don't accept yarn that's already been wound. You might have knitted off it already." Fine, whatever, get a scale. 100g = 100g. \n\nBut my biggest complaint was that I never asked to have my yarn wound when I bought it -- I went to check out, and the yarn was taken from me and wound. No explanation that it nullified my ability to return it, nothing.\n\nDespite the fact this store is half a block from my house, I won't be back. The flippant manner in which I was treated (as if I should have known this by osmosis?) soured my experience.
-0b86isaXMY0v4g-V8GZ9Q	The woman working was friendly and the customers who were also there seemed like happy regulars.  The shop isn't nearly as big as other places, but it was stuffed with great yarn.  There were many many books, beads, and knitting supplies to choose from, as well as some cute stuff.  I'd recommend a visit if you're into crochet/knitting at all.
-0b86isaXMY0v4g-V8GZ9Q	I have had two opportunities to buy yarn from this store. Great yarns. Lousy customer service. Sales staff seemed put out by my questions. I will give them one more try--but if I am treated poorly I will take my business elsewhere.
-0d4L4U3vKnTT0MEgyX_WA	Found this shop via yelp while in the area running errands.  I walked in looking for some e juice, was welcomed to sit and sample from a wide variety of juices on hand.  I was pressed for time and asked for something sweet and the guy (I'm horrible with names) suggested "Summer Wapple". I believe it's one of their "Da Val" in house blends.  He even mixed a bottle for me right there, smelled delicious like some kind of watermelon candy...I can't put my vape pen down today it's so good!  \nFriendly service, tasty juice.  Will be back.
-0d4L4U3vKnTT0MEgyX_WA	This is a pretty good shop, overall nice selection of items and Ejuice. Staff is alright, could be a little more interactive with customers but overall were helpful then most other places I've been too. The one thing i did like is their house Ejuice line. They have some pretty good flavors. Summer wapple has to be the best out of all them. \n\nIn terms of large selection they don't have a lot, they do have nice authentics and clones but not a large selection to choose from. They do have updated items that people are looking for but for me  I wish they had more. Instead of going every week to see what they have I wait about two or three weeks because  I know they wont get in stuff for a little. Might be a downer for most but I can live with it.
-0d4L4U3vKnTT0MEgyX_WA	David has a very nice shop that can accommodate all your needs.  He carries a nice line of AUTHENTIC mods which is a nice change.  He also has a great selection of quality clones.  After buying a couple of rba's, he took the time to build the coil for us along with great instruction on care and how to build ourselves.  Also has an awesome juice selection!  He never made my wife and I feel rushed and answered all of our questions.  There are a lot of options in Vegas, but we will be loyal customers to this shop now.
-0d4L4U3vKnTT0MEgyX_WA	Love this place & the atmosphere! Great selection of mods & rbas! Will deff be back for future needs.
-0d4L4U3vKnTT0MEgyX_WA	Great guys, super helpful. They have a solution for all your vaping needs. I just picked up a cloupour cloutank-Dry herb/wax  vaporizer and couldn't be happier. They have  a sweet taster bar, only one in town so you can preview your flavors! Ask for Manny, dude can seriously build and is super helpful. Happy vaping!
-0d4L4U3vKnTT0MEgyX_WA	I've visited numerous Vape shops around town, and this shop is my #1 go to spot for all my Vape needs. There customer service  is outstanding, they make sure you leave with 100% customer satisfaction and all your   questions are answered. Pick N Puff is a distinguished shop from the rest from the second you walk in the ambience alone is good enough to just Vape and meet new people or just relax and lounge. They have a variety of juices including their own called " Daval" I definitely recommend their DTG Vanilla Custard or you can try all their different flavors on their samples bar. This shop has it all their shop is immaculate, sure does make you feel like your walking into a high end Vape shop! Overall this shop easily became my one stop shop for all my vaping needs.
-0d4L4U3vKnTT0MEgyX_WA	Best employers\nAlways helping me out with good deals\nVery kind. \nTahnks to Manny and Conner
-0d4L4U3vKnTT0MEgyX_WA	Best vape shop in Vegas. Very knowledgeable staff and great juices. They have a tasting bar so you can check out the flavors before you buy. If you have any questions or just need a build, this is the place to go.
-0d4L4U3vKnTT0MEgyX_WA	This was my first time ever in a vape shop. So I didn't really know anything about vapping or the like. Manny (the gentleman working) explained everything to me and answered all my questions. He explained the difference between a start up set and the modded sets. He was a huge help and I will be stopping back by whenever I need questions answered. \n\nOn top of all that they seem to make their own liquids at the shop which is awesome. It's unique and helps set this shop apart from basic shops. \n\nI highly recommend coming by this shop and I will definitely be stopping by here more often!
-0d4L4U3vKnTT0MEgyX_WA	Seriously the best vape shop I've walked into, you will not regret stopping by. Dave the owner is awesome, customers experience comes first. They have tons of mods, authentic and clones, and will customize your rig. Come in and enjoy the e-juice bar and find your new favorite flavor.\nThanks for hooking me up with a sweet mod!
-0DwB6Swi349EKfbBAOF7A	I discovered Qi Natural Foods after buying some cat food next door at Bark & Meow. This store is amazing! It's larger than it looks, with even a grocery section in the back w/bulk bins, gluten free products, refrigerated & frozen stuff, and more, in the back. I picked up some raw sugar, veg bouillon, and tofu today. Up front it's vitamins and supplements, with a good selection and fantastic prices. The mid part of the store is bodycare stuff. Their prices are great across the board... I sniffed around extensively and found: my algae-based Omega-3 oil was just $25 (I paid $40 in Guelph and $35 at Health Service Ctr near Dovercourt for the same product); the Green Beaver lotions, Desert Essentials facewash and Avalon Organic shampoos are better priced than anywhere I've ever seen in Toronto. They also sell the types of things I normally order online from iHerb or LuckyVitamin, like pure glycerin, bentonite clay and jojoba oil. Staff were friendly & knowledgeable when I needed help finding ALA vcaps. Did I mention the prices are great?!
-0DwB6Swi349EKfbBAOF7A	The price is right!  (priceS)...\n\nQi is a go to place for many of my staple needs - organic rice, dha, cereals, snacks, nuts, jams,...\n\nMost of the people working there won't be able to answer specific questions (i.e. Is product A or B, better; what is good to use for x skin condition...)\nHowever, there is a male worker there, I've only ever seen him in the daytime, and he's knowledgeable.  The others seem to be guessing their answers; they're just people who work there, neither trained to be, nor are, health buffs.\n\nThat said, you'll find enough variety in this store, and... the prices are (generally) right.\n\nSometimes the walkways are narrow, but everyone seems to figure out how to respectufully get past each other.
-0DwB6Swi349EKfbBAOF7A	They have a very fine selection of raw herbs neatly packaged and preweighed but don't expect any advice or help with the products. More often than not you'll get a blank stare.
-0DwB6Swi349EKfbBAOF7A	Excellent place if you're in the area.  The store is spotlessly clean, the items fresh and the staff attentive and knowledgeable.  What a difference to having to endure those miseries at Noah's at Yonge and Eligible.  This place carries an extensive variety and assortment of well-regarded products and their prices are fairly reasonable.  A go-to place for me.
-0DwB6Swi349EKfbBAOF7A	Great prices, many of my regular purchases are cheaper here than even Kensington market. But with all supplements, I find you really have to shop around.
-0DwB6Swi349EKfbBAOF7A	Big selection and reasonable prices though I did find that some products were more expensive then what I paid for them at their Roncesvalles location.  I did not find the staff helpful nor knowledgeable about the products.
-0DwB6Swi349EKfbBAOF7A	This Natural Food store has a great selection of just about everything from Health and beauty products, to whole foods, supplements and bulk items. The aisles are more generous than other health food stores and I found that shopping here was a joy.  Prices weren't as high as I had expected, either.
-0DwB6Swi349EKfbBAOF7A	This is definitely one of my new favorite health and supplements places to go. The staff are always, always so helpful and friendly here: no Big Carrot rager attitudes! Overall they obviously don't have the same amount of stock as other places, but it's pretty decent for the prices they charge. Everything seems fresh and very clean. Prices are competitive and make this place worthy of a repeat visit.
-0DwB6Swi349EKfbBAOF7A	I was very happy to find this place!  Before kids I had tome to walk through Kensington after work and lived in the Annex so I had many choices.  Now that we live in Bloordale my options are more limited and usually very expensive.\n\nI have compared many prices to Essence of Life in Kensington which is great value for your buck and many of the items I purchase at Qi are the same costs as Essence.  Awesome.  I agree - staff are not always so knowledgeable but I know enough to get around in a place like this so it's not a real concern for me.\n\nWill continue to be a devoted patron :)
-0DwB6Swi349EKfbBAOF7A	The prices are good for the most part, however, some items are way off beat. A remedy for $38.99 at Qi is for $16.99 at Ottway. Thats too much of a difference. Same with Quercetin AOR. $33.00 at Qi, $22 at other places. So, make sure you have shopped around before going there. \nBesides, if you have a question, dont ask at Qi, they will give you an answer that you cannot understand. You want good customer service for the bucks you are spending, then this place does not have that. I spent over $200 and it was as if they did not give a damn. Every time.
-0DwB6Swi349EKfbBAOF7A	Bought a bottle of oil of oregano, they were helpful and walked me through the difference between brands and content concentration level.\n\nThey would be better off if they are able to speak better english, but they're located in Korea town, so I don't blame them.\n\nGood place.
-0hYy3V50dM1Avy5jewUZg	Used to visit here quite a lot but since then there have been several new hairdressers (Owners?) and they do not seem to offer the hot shave that I enjoyed so much when the turkish / armenian guy was still there. The girl hairdresser is well competent and very sweet if not a little patronising - as she offered me a sweety after being a 'good boy' when the haircut took place. You could tell it was done often as she had a big jar of the sugar treats! \nHowever I did have a very good haircut, but next time i'd like to leave a place without feeling like a 12 yer old :o)
-0hYy3V50dM1Avy5jewUZg	The new owners have had this place for over year now and Aleks (the male barber) always does a great job.  I always get a very short/bald fade and his blending is masterful and he takes his time.  The lady barber I have had less success with.
-0hYy3V50dM1Avy5jewUZg	I don't know what to say about this place really, it's kind of left me with mixed feelings.\n\nI'll start with the bad for a change. I don't want to question somebody that's qualified to do something that I can't. But I got the impression that they didn't really know what to do with longer hair. I imagine most guys that go decide on a number between 2 and 5  and its done. I think the staff member was just mad that scissors had to be used to cut my hair. I didn't get a bad hair cut, but it wasn't great either.\n\nThe good, it's very close to the city centre and I didn't have to wait at all. It's also cheap, but then again what barbers isn't.\n\nGood if you need something done quickly.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	Im used to strong shisha flavors. The mango flavor was too weak for me. Expected music and a more vibrant environment. Wasnt too impressed with the place.  The waffle with the three ice cream scoops and fruits was w
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	I recently moved into the neighbourhood and was excited to try this place out but I don't think I've ever been this displeased with restaurant service, especially as someone who has worked in the restaurant industry and is very patient.\nI came here with my boyfriend and started off with drinks, telling the server that we would get shisha after our drinks. My boyfriend finished his drink before me and was sitting there for probably 10 minutes without anyone coming over after the owner and the lady working there passed us several times. I finished mine and we sat there for probably another 15 minutes without so much as an acknowledgement. I was going to give him another 10 minutes but after seeing them serving other people, passing us several times and the owner sitting down when it was clear we were finished our drinks, it started to feel like we were being actively ignored. We got fed up and paid for our drinks and left, when we were planning on getting another two drinks as well as shisha. Waste of time and money.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	This place is amazing. Great service, great drinks, great atmosphere. To bad Toronto stopped allowing hookah bars. The shush a was always very flavourful.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	Cock-block. Third Wheel. That was I the evening of our visit here to Buda Cafe. My friend Romeo and his lady friend had brought me along to their dinner after work, and I've managed to stick around to the later hours of the night. Thank God they were far more civilized people than myself.\n\nI've passed this establishment for years, and during my high school years I always thought that this was the dwelling of Persian gangsters. Now that I am older and more sensible, I have realized that there is no criminal connection here, young Persian Men just dress that way. \n\nGlorious Shisha, the precious..sacred act of smoking indoors. God Bless the hookah. I asked for two flavours of the charcoal, I ended up with two hookahs. Well played family owned business...\nWe sat outside at the small street-side patio and it was remarkably comfortable. The cocktails here were fairly priced, the coffee here reasonable as well. Make no mistake, this is a bar which serves coffee, and no the other way around. There are constantly modified cars with bright lights parallel parked outside, but the environment is by no means hostile. \nThe waffles and ice cream sundae here are favourites, but I stuck to the White Russian throughout the two hours here. Buda is one of the few cafes in the city that is completely chill, and because it's a bar it makes it that much more remarkable. This explains why it's been here for so long, these owners figured it out. A difficult task considering the location. \nI have an urge to approach the Women at the other tables here despite the Men they're with. That's how chill it was, but I am no fool.\nThe apple flavoured shisha was delicious. Don't worry about the smoke, it's all flavoured so just pretend there's vitamins.\n\nVery relaxing and mellow establishment, which probably explains why Romeo didn't kill me for sticking around.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	Right off of Yonge street and very close to Finch station, if you feel like going to a hookah lounge - this isn't a bad place.\n\nIt's not really much of a lounge setting, more of a small restaurant and they bring the hookah to you.\n\nThe day I went, the fire alarm kept ringing. I assumed the owner would come over and apologize or reassure my friend and I that there were no problems... However, it just kept ringing the whole time we were there.\n\nThere isn't really anything special about the place and it's really small in size.\n\n3/5
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	Buda cafe is a very chill cafe. Its a little cozy place tucked away on yonge, but the owners are very accommodating. No matter how big the crowd, they always seem to make a table for them. Service to me was amazing. They were even nice to look out for customers in regards to parking.\n\nThey have specials like two shishas for $21.99 and you could mix upto two flavours per shisha without extra charges. I had amaretto sour thinking it might not be good but the cocktails and food were pretty good here too.\n\nOverall a very relaxed friendly environment.\nDefinitely a place worth coming back.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	We had a roasted brown tea and a cappuccino. \n\nHere's the thing:\n- good selection of teas, and for what concerns the tea I ordered, I don't have reason to complain. \n- the cappuccino: being Italian, I think I can proudly say I know how to differentiate a good one from a bad one.\nExactly, a bad one: this is by far the worst cappuccino I ever drank, and certainly, not worth $5+tax. \n\nService was a mere O-K just because we've been asked if we wanted chocolate or cinnamon on the capuccino. We decided to go for cinnamon, and we got chocolate instead. \n\nOverall the experience was ....blah! \nBuda bar is safe when it comes to tea but can't say the same when it comes to capuccini (FYI: 1=capuccino, 2 or + = cappuccini). \n\nUnfortunately I gotta say that from my experience if you can, choose another place where to "invest" your money for a drink. \n\n:)
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	One of the worst shisha places in toronto. I think they closed down because this place is literally empty all the time. I feel so sad to see this great location go to waste.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	I went there a few days ago and i loved the place. The people working there were nice and the they had great shisha.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	Hooray for Yelp check-in offers! By checking in at Buda Cafe, you get $8 off your purchase of two shishas.. but wait, they advertise the same on their menu.. \n\nThe owner of Buda is very homely and accommodating - he constantly came over to our table to check on our charcoal. He turns away customers when it's close to their closing time, but never rushes the existing customers already seated. \n\nThe flavors are extensive - mixed fruit, watermelon, lemon...etc. They also have a drinks menu that range from mojitos to straight shots. The patio seats around 8-10 people, and is a great place to just relax on a warm summer night. \n\nIf you have not tried shisha in this predominantly Persian neighborhood, Buda Cafe is the place to go! \n\nBonus points: Surprisingly clean washrooms!
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	The first time I went to this place it was over a summer and very late at night, I was with a group of friends and the owner of the place was working, he patiently waited for us to finish and never came to ask us to leave. We stayed thinking that Buda Cafe was open till late at night, we stayed almost 2 hours passed the closing time. The owner never said a word and waited for us to leave, we all felt so bad for making him stay so late but grateful for his hospitality. \n\nI really enjoy the Shisha at this place, the flavours and the coffee and fruit selection, I am big coffee fan and I like the great customer service Persian know how to give. I definitely recommend this place. \n\n#30daysofYelp
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	A cozy place to go for shisha (no orange heads though). Upbeat music playing in the background. Great service but a little stingy with the charcoal. The shisha itself was fancy but the flavor felt weak. Free WiFi. Prices are reasonable. Discount for buying 2 or 3 shishas and 10% discount on top of that every Wednesday. Check out their website for their daily specials.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	The following review is solely based on the shisha, as we regretfully did not have the time for food. \n\nThe shisha flavour (apple mint) was great, from whatever we could manage of it. Unfortunately, it was a mission to get it to produce smoke at the beginning. Most likely because the air valve was wonky. You could tell there was no ball bearing in the valve at times since the air kept escaping. How to know if there's no ball bearing? Blow on the shisha pipe, if air escapes from the sides = open valve. If it doesn't, you're good to go. Note to owner: invest in some ball bearings. BB pellets work fine, too. We had to use two coals to make up for it, which left the shisha chalky and gross within 20 minutes despite producing lots of smoke for a little while before that. Because of that, one star for the shisha. Only saving grace is the fact that the prices are pretty cheap and that the owner/sole employee was super sweet and welcoming, albeit did not look very professional as we didn't even know she was working there when we came in because she had her headphones in and feet up. Others would be offended, personally thought it was too beautiful of a day to be mad at her for it! And she was sweet afterwards. Help yourself to free water instead of having to wait for it! \n\nAll together, three stars for the beautiful decor; an eclectic mix of modern and traditional. The walls next to the bar counter are decorated with napkins with drawings on it. If the artist(s) is/are reading this review, your work is amazing!
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	Not many places in this block to just have a drink if you don't feel like soju or sake. I've passed by this place many times so thought I would give it a try. It's not quite a lounge, and could be made to be more comfortable inside. We sat on the patio and ordered two hookahs - it was priced as expected although they said there was a deal on that day. I wouldn't pay more than what we did - about $11 per hookah. Excellent flavour selection.\n\nThe martinis were a bit pricey considering they tasted like there was only 1oz of alcohol in them, and for the lack of atmosphere. Not sure I would order a cocktail here again, but would come back for the hookah!
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	Ah lost my shisha cherry here many years ago. Now it's just obligatory for me to do the same to my shisha virgin friends at the same spot.\nIf you are a shisha newb, I recommend the mint flavour as a starter. It's more refreshing than the other flavours and you won't end up with a gain headache.\nDon't purchase extra charcoal. By the time you get to 2nd charcoal that came with your shisha, you'd be smoking charcoal fume only. So if you want to smoke more, I suggest you to get an extra shisha.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	This place is legit. Shisha offered is never harsh and it never burns your throat. Good selection of hookah flavours, they serve alcohol and the service is great. And the restaurant itself is really clean inside and not dirty like your typical hookah bars in Scarborough/ north York area. \n\nWill always go here for hookah, great location as well :)
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	This shisha bar has been around since I was in high school. I love coming here especially in the summer, for their little outdoor seating by the street. Price is reasonable, for food and drinks alike. They have a good selection of flavors for their shisha. \n\nOnly thing that was always a peeve for me was the seating, but there's not much else to complain about.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	Very chill especially on a Monday evening. We told them the corner is too loud so they turned down the music volume for us. Good shisha and Persian tea served with a small chocolate bite. Their interior is also very home like and dim. I think their shisha is much milder compared to other places. I usually cough after smoking, but not here.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	Shisha slash hooka for $15 is the way to go,  plus it isn't bad. Small place but a nice atmosphere with a nice little menu.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	I love this place. The sheesha (although herbal) is never disappointing and the owner has to be the nicest guy around and he looks after the customers. Never ordered any food items coz I usually enjoy sheesha with a nice drink. Coffees and teas are great every time. Decent price and a nice cozy ambiance ... No complains. Kinda small for large groups so definitely call ahead for availability.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	Buda cafe is located  at Northyork and Yonge. The bar area is quite small, however it makes up with a friendly staff and a good shisha. \n\nThey offer an outdoor seating in summer, try mintflavor for shisha and green tea for drink. Enjoy!
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	Pricey but very sanitary. The staff is nice, and it's a nice environment at night. It's more of a restaurant setting rather than a lounge.
-0mgn9dRi95otXd_h61LdA	I am a fan of this place partly because of the good location uptown, on Yonge street. Also because they serve alcohol (even mixed drinks like White Russian and Long Island Iced Tea), which isn't that common for hookah cafes. The table next to us had a full bottle of wine they were sharing. They also have teas which I'm told are delicious, along with dessert items. \n\nOn a warm summer night, this is a great spot with their outdoor patio setting that probably fits 10-15 people at most. The view is of Yonge street so with busy traffic from cars and pedestrians, this makes for a relaxed setting. Hours are open decently late. \n\nHookahs are about $15 to share for two people. The mango and mint tasted nice. Owner is pretty nice. There is only one unisex bathroom though. It is the only cafe of its kind in that area that I know of, so it's a hot spot. The clientele is there.\n\nUpdate: Last time I was there, they made us order drinks in order to smoke shisha. Felt a way about being forced to get drinks. Would have gone elsewhere if there were other options nearby.
-0nEqS3_A_nnUut4DrEPEg	Yoga Digs is a great group of instructors & positive community. They did a great job offering unique events while in their south side location. Looking forward to joining them for class in Green Tree!
-0nEqS3_A_nnUut4DrEPEg	I love the new Yoga Digs studio in Green Tree!! It has such a positive and calming atmosphere with extremely friendly and experienced instructors. YD offers so many different fun classes... I would definitely recommend it!
-0nEqS3_A_nnUut4DrEPEg	Love this space!! And the community makes it feel like home.
-0nEqS3_A_nnUut4DrEPEg	I started doing yoga last march and I started at Yoga Digs.  Never having done yoga I came to class with low expectations, however I was impressed by the relaxed and inviting atmosphere and the connection between the teachers and students.  I was able to learn and grow in my yoga classes.  I am now a die hard yogi!!  My husband has done nothing but comment on the positive changes in my body and my attitude.  Lindsay and the crew are top notch!!
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	4 star for atmosphere.\n4 star for service after 3pm.\n3 star for food...\n\nThe standout here is the 30% off food from 3pm-7pm during weekdays.  It's a really great deal!  The decor and atmosphere here is dark and classy, and after the lunch hour rush has dissipated, obtaining service is not an issue.  The daily drink specials are a bargain.  On a Friday evening, glasses of sangria is $3.48 each.\n\nThe food unfortunately downgrades the rating for this restaurant.  I had the 18 maki set where the rice was just a bit too thick, and the nori just a bit soggy.  It really wasn't anything special and the quality didn't meet my expectations.  A previous visit provided slightly better, but similar results.\n\nThough I didn't try any, the restaurant is now all about organic beef purchased from local farmers.  You can even order large cuts of beef from them sourced directly from the farmers!\n\nUninspired food, but an interesting, quiet place to people watch for after-hour Bay St-ers ogling and chatting up the bartender.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	Food was ok except for sushi - sub-par but expected. \n\nI had the Squash Soup which was nice slightly creamy pureed soup. I liked the salad - spring mix with one piece of avocado, mango, cherry tomatoes and spicy ginger-citrus dressing. The miso glazed black cod was cooked perfectly, however the broccoli and cauliflower were hard, and the rice was cold. Dessert was apple crumble with green tea icecream - a hard, granola type crumble with soft apples at the bottom. Fried banana was okay too.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	The menu is actually a mix of Japanese and Korean food.  I was going to go for some sashimi, but based I other mixed menu places I have been, I decided yo go for something else.  \n\nI ordered the beef teriyaki bento box, which came with a coleslaw (not kimchi), clear noodles, and vegetable tempura.  The serving size was very good for the price and I found the quality of the ingredients to be good.\n\nThe service was polite and quick. I would go back for a quick lunch here!
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	Going to have to give this place a big fat one star. \n\nWe came here for a lunch date for the girls.  The servers were disorganized and rude. They were dealing with a busy lunch crowd, especially being in the path that's always a given.  I ordered the bibimbap and shortly after my stomach did not agree with what I ate =/ \n\nThe servers refused to split our bills up because we had made reservations. Never thought that was a rule, when we settled with one bill but different payments she gave us attitude and told us "no" walked away and came back with the machine demanding us to pay for the bill. Not only that but she added 15% gratuity in PEN on the receipt after she had printed it. Another rule that was made up. \n\nThe food was mediocre as expected in the path, over priced and undelivering but I guess someone has to pay for the rent. \nI will not be returning even if my meal is free.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	Took 8 colleagues visiting from across the country for lunch. Everyone really enjoyed their food. It's a very busy spot, but service and prices were decent. I'm not a sushi fan, so ordered one of the Bento Boxes. It was delicious - espcially the tempura shrimp. All meals come with a small salad and miso soup - both of which were great. Yum. I would definitely go back to Akco and will recommend.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	I work on Bay Street and often go to Akco for lunch dates. The service is quick, efficient and friendly, and the sushi is consistently good. I always order the salmon and tuna maki, and have never had a bad piece of fish here. I like that they don't use too much rice in the rolls (not a fan of huge rolls that you can barely fit in your mouth), and that they have options for non-sushi eaters. I also highly recommend the gyoza- delicious!\n\nI (along with the rest of my office) often get take-out from Akco for lunch.  We've never had a bad experience, and it's usually a very quick turn-around. \n\nMy only warning is that it seems like the quality is better at lunch than dinner. I recently went for happy hour (30% off between 3-7pm) for the first time, and can understand why other reviewers may have been disappointed if that was their only experience with Akco. I'm not sure what it was, but some of the rolls were not in keeping with the quality that i've come to expect from them. For example, the fish was a bit too cold and the rice tasted like it had been in the fridge.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. \n\nOverall, it's one of the better options in the financial district for sushi and I'll definitely be back.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	It's always nice to see some additional ethnic food offerings in the financial district. So in that regard, this place does OK. But apart from the location, there is really nothing spectacular about this place.\n\nI came here for a work-related lunch. We had reservations, so we were seated promptly. Otherwise, it does get rather busy here. Service was generally courteous, quick, and attentive. No complaints there.\n\nThe menu offers up a number of standard Korean and Japanese offerings, ranging from sushi to bibimbap. My colleagues had some sushi while I opted for a more simple bibimbap. The sushi was laid out nicely, fairly fresh, and rice-fish ratios were reasonable. Nothing special, just decent. My bibimbap was much the same. Edible, albeit a bit less flavourful than the ones I've had at any of the mainstay Korean restaurants uptown.\n\nPrice is a touch on the higher end, which is to be expected given the location.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	Arrived here like a stray lamb for lunch with some co-workers. We were quickly seated in two nearby tables as we were a large party.\n\nThey have attractive names in their menu, grass fed cow. Makes them sound more delicious. I ordered the bulgogi bibimbap. It was yummm.. their gochuyang is more sweet than usual, but I enjoyed the taste and it tasted great especially for the PATH.\n\nI sampled their meatballs from my nice coworker, and they taste really nice.. italian! A pleasant experience despite secretly craving the kalbi, but I happily settled for the bulgogi for the lower price. lalala~~
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	Located in First Canadian Place, this is a good option for lunch if you want to go to a nicer kind of sit-down restaurant in the PATH. I was lucky to get a table during the lunch time rush with a group of 5 coworkers, considering we didn't make a reservation. The service is quite efficient here, probably because they are accustomed to dealing with Financial District employees who are pressed for time. They have a fairly large variety of options on their lunch menu - individual sushi rolls, salads, bento boxes, and they have a mix of Japanese and Korean food (i.e. bibimbap, etc.) For a nicer sit-down restaurant, the prices are pretty reasonable, mostly ranging from $10-$15 for a lunch item. One of my coworkers ordered a bento box/set lunch, and it came with a LOT of food - sushi rolls, teriyaki chicken, glass noodles, tempura, etc. My other coworkers ordered salads (not just your typical salads, one was a calamari salad and I forget what the others were), and they were presented very nicely and looked delicious. I got chirashi don for $15.99 and was pleased and satisfied with my choice. It came in a decent sized portion with lots of sashimi on it. There were about 7 pieces of salmon, 3 pieces of white tuna (?), 3 pieces of red tuna(?) and lots of fish roe. All of the sashimi tasted fresh and delicious. I would definitely come again!
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	My colleague and I decided to lunch at Akco Lounge after a last minute lunch reservation snafu at another restaurant.  Luckily, it wasn't terribly busy and we were seated right away.\n\nOur server was friendly and efficient, though there was a bit of a "situation" near the end, but more on that later.\n\nWe ordered endamame, California rolls and a grilled scallop with mango salad.  All three dishes were delicious, though the portion size for the California roll was a bit small.  The scallops (2 large scallops) were perfectly grilled and the mango salad, which wasn't really a mango salad, but rather a few slivers of mango and cucumber thrown onto a small bed of mixed greens, was perfectly dressed with just a drizzle of a sweet citrus dressing.\n\nOur total bill for the 2 appetizers and California roll was $33 including tip.\n\nOf note, we were in a bit of a hurry to pay our bill as my colleague had a 1pm meeting, so we handed our server a credit card and asked her to process our bill.  She came back to our area with a large platter of food for the table behind us, along with our bill. However, after having served the table their food, our server opened up the billfold to check before handing us our bill, only to discover that the credit card was gone...after a few frantic minutes of servers racing around the restaurant looking under tables and plates to try and locate the missing credit card, the table behind us announced to our server that they had located the credit card under their table.  It must have fallen out of the billfold while she was dropping off their food.\n\nAnyway, crisis averted.  All in all a good experience.  Food was ok, price was a little on the high side, but it is lunch downtown.\n\n**I would like to note that I do order take-out from them quite often...best to call well in advance of pick up, and make sure you check your order before leaving, as they've forgotten to include items on more than one occasion.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	Rotten fish; rotten service. \nPutrid seaweed; no, not fermented: putrid. \nTasteless green tea. How'd they manage to screw that up?\nThere was no polite way to dispose of the rubber that was my (not) miso-glazed octopus. \nThe avocado in my handroll was rotten. Not bruised: rotten.\nJumbled courses. Water server after savories, after requesting it twice. \nTo top it off, the (banker) suits around us were practically getting kneeling service. \nOur intended quickie lunch ended up lasting over 2 hours! Every time we flagged our server because we wanted to pay up and leave, he made an excuse for the kitchen. \nOur $40 lunch was barely picked at. I really wish I'd returned my dishes to the kitchen.\nWe are typically generous tippers, but this was one time where it pained us to leave even 10%. We did. That's why it pains me to have to leave one star, as well. I suppose that can count for the convenient location. \n\nIf you are craving sushi at lunch time, Sushi Q, also at various intervals on the P.A.T.H, is delicious and fast. Their rice is perfectly gooey, the bites are the right size, and the salmon is always fresh. Plus, they are friendly. The drawback is that there's no dedicated table.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	I've eaten here for decades, and was sad to see it all boarded up last week!  I hope it's just being renovated, and not closed for good!  I'm jonesin' for some beef teriyaki!
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	Love the 18pc maki combo and the tempura spicy salmon / tuna rolls. If you go during the happy hour it is totally worth it. Best sushi in the downtown core. Nothing compares.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	Modest sushi restaurant in the PATH. Does the job. Efficient and quick service.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	clam chowder cannot be called chowder - super thin, pretty tasteless\nstirfry chicken - cold, gross pieces of chicken, noodles were ok but not much of it, broccoli was unexpectedly cold - yes, cold. What do I expect for $5 though?\nonly saving grace was the hotsauce --  a nice alternative to sriachia (sp?) in the rooster bottle that you usually find..\nSaw they had sushi and sashimi too.. looked ok, but I'm leery to try it after my experience today.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	Came here for lunch with a few coworkers and it was super busy. We waited at least 15 minutes before the server even asked us for for a drink or what we wanted to order. Of course being in an asian restaurant you can't expect good service. Our server was rude and not attentive. We each ordered our own dishes and that took another 30 mins so by the time we got our food we had to rush our meal since we were on our lunch break. I ordered the spicy salmon tempura roll and let me just say that this was the worse roll I've ever had. The presentation was terrible and the salmon inside the roll was cold, lacked flavour and wasn't even spicy at all. I was very disappointed. \n\nLastly, when when we asked for separate bills they said that wasn't allowed for a reservation for 5 or more (please note). Only restaurants that make up this rule are just not efficient. Wish we could have left no tip but of course a 15% gratuity was automatically charged. That just means I won't be coming back.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	This is a great place in the financial district for a "nice lunch" without breaking the bank.  They serve up japanese and korean food so you can get a sushi/sashimi combo, a bento box, bimbimbap, etc.\n\nService is decent and relatively fast so you can be in and out within an hour.  Reservations are recommended, especially in December when lots of people splurge for the holidays and get together with friend/coworkers when things aren't quite so busy at the office.\n\nI come here every time I have a craving for hwe dup bop (Akco's version is rice topped with arugula/field greens, and sashimi with korean spicy sauce).  This seems to be the only place in the downtown core where you can find it (or at least so I could find).\n\nIt's a pretty solid choice for when food court sushi won't cut it, but you don't want to spend the $$$$ to go to a place like Ki.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	I was pleasantly surprised by my last visit to Akco Lounge. Next to Ho Shim, I always thought it just served up Ho Shim food (which is quite cheap and only so-so) at more expensive prices in nicer digs.\n\nI went for lunch on a Friday with a coworker because it was close. I ordered the Salmon Set - I got 6 pieces of salmon sushi and one salmon roll for $12.95. Fairly reasonable for this neck of the woods in Financial District. As Karen S says, they also have 30% off food from 3pm-7pm, so I can see that as a great deal.\n\nMy sushi tasted surprisingly fresh and had a sauce that was quite delicious. It was the type of sauce you would get in spicy tuna or spicy tuna roll - worked really well here. It also came with miso soup and salad - fairly standard issue but no stand-out here. \n\nI was debating about giving it between 3 and 4, but I decided to bump up to 4 stars due to the sauce, the location and decor (swanky dark) and reasonable prices for its location. Service was efficient. I would recommend this place as a decent sushi place for lunch. I would return again.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	This is probably the only 2-star place I go to regularly.  Why? It's one building over from my office.   I have to say, the sushi is average at best, and rather highly priced.   Service at lunchtime can be painfully slow.   If only Fune wasn't always full, I'd never come back.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	I liked this place.  We went with a big group of people and the waiter (possibly the manager) was great.  \n\nWe bought expensive wine so he hooked us up by giving us free miso soups and appetizer (I can't remember which one).  \n\nWe ordered a sushi boat to start.  Everything on the sushi boat was great.   \n\nThen we ordered a few entrees to share- black cod, salmon, sushi pizza, tempura vegetables, and some kind of noodle soup.  The block cod and salmon were really tasty.  I personally didn't care for the sushi pizza but my friends all did.  The tempura veggies were good.  The noodle soup (can't remember exactly which one we had) was only ok.  Didn't have a lot of flavor but nothing too awful.
-0NhdsDJsdarxyDPR523ZQ	The price is right, or fair at least.\n\nI went with two others, and immediately two of us noticed the Daily Drink specials.  We went there on a Thursday evening, and the crantini's were $3.99.  They tasted watered down.  Maybe try going on a Monday, when they have sake martinis - if you want a full(?) shot of alcohol, I guess.\n\nI ordered their vegetarian bento ($12.99), vegetarian dragon roll ($8.99?), and Akco fries ($5?) with a specially requested wasabi mayo.\nThe dragon roll was good, with their tempura yam inside...\n\nThing is, I guess I'm particular about tempura batter.  Whenever I eat tempura.  Ugh!  The batter here was so thick, I could have attached a pencil to the bottom of one deep fried slice of potato or yam, and cheaply replaced a ping pong paddle.  They were so thick and hard, children/dolls/little dogs, could use them as fake frisbees.  No, these tempura'd veggies, were battered up - to an extreme.  \n\nAt first, I ate and ate (I had an appetite going into the place), but after a while I had a small epiphany -- the battered veggies stood out as being too thick and too hard.  I suggest they consider changing their batter to a lighter one.  Perhaps the average person wouldn't mind their existing batter, however.\n\nWorth one shot; maybe or maybe not... two visits.\n\n~\naside: From the corner that we were in, we seemed privy to some interesting behaviours displayed by two of their 20-something bartender and server (both female).  They were chummy with their male clients at the bar.  I suggest that if you're a single heterosexual male Yelper, with a penchant for the act of karaoke (which they have), drinking alcohol, and having ready company of two cute enough females, go there, and sit at the bar.  No promises, but you may find yourself basking in the glow of some decidedly focused staff attention...\nWe saw one of them, in particular, walk her clients out, hug some of them, kiss one of them on the side of his face, lots of touchy touchy feel goodness going on.
-0oNlErLlU7PQa-TpespdA	So I know this place good because quite frankly - I don't remember much of my visit. I remember my first Chambord martini, and that's about it. Had a sip of the martini, we planted ourselves near the fireplace, and that's all I've got. Well done bartender! \n\nWould DEFINITELY go back. ;)
-0oNlErLlU7PQa-TpespdA	I really like this place! Living in Chagrin I somehow did not frequent 87 West. However, I think that's going to change. For one, on Wednesday night they have 1/2 off bottles of wine. And although I can agree with Scott that there is nothing on the wine list that I go crazy over, the Pinot Grigio is fine by me. Especially when it's 1/2 off.\n\n I love walking in because it's so cozy. There are plush chairs and comfortable couches to sit in rather than a disarray of bar stools. The lights are dim and you feel like you're at home in your own living room. Very relaxed atmosphere. \n\nI really wouldn't go there to eat. I have had food there before, it's not bad. But it does take long and I think it's a little overpriced for the portions they give you. My friend noticed that the portions had gone down in size since the last time she ordered something. I guess it wouldn't be bad to split a few appetizers, but you'd definitely need a few.
-0oNlErLlU7PQa-TpespdA	Here's what I like about this place- they are in a great location.  In the summer the patio is the place to be.  It's unique as well with French bistro lighting strung up and cafe tables that are always packed.  In the winter it is a cozy place to be with lots of bench seating and a fireplace that blasts heat all night long.  \n\nTheir wine list is kinda laughable since it is called a wine bar, but I guess that it would please the masses.  I just really don't ever find anything that is interesting on their list in red or white. The rest of the booze taste just fine to me and they make one mean double dirty martini on the rocks with blue cheese stuffed olives.  A couple of those and I might just order a glass of wine.\n\nThe nibbles are good, but you will wait for a while since they come from the restaurants around them- Gamekeepers and West End.  We have always been a fan of the cheese board.  They used to have these tenderloin bites as well that were just fantastic.  Not sure what happened to those.\n\nThe best draw to this place is the bartender Jen.  She is fantastic, conscientious and funny.  I don't think that she is there anymore, so hopefully they found someone to replace her who is just as good.  Whenever we went I didn't even have to order- my dirty just showed up.  Kind of like Cheers, only clean and outside.
-0oNlErLlU7PQa-TpespdA	Good, strong drinks, nice patio and atmosphere.  Server was attentive.  There is a large fire pit on the patio; it was very nice.  This place is quieter than most bars; you can actually hold a conversation.  This bar is especially enjoyable after seeing a show at the theatre; it's conveniently located.
-0oNlErLlU7PQa-TpespdA	Cozy outdoor patio, lit with lights laced around the nearby trees--perfect for a drink with friends on a summer's evening. Also, Patrick was extraordinarily helpful, friendly, and a blast for our table.
-0oNlErLlU7PQa-TpespdA	My two friends and I met up here last Saturday night. It was my first time, and finding it was confusing. It looks like a little house right on the corner. Once I was inside though, I loved the quaint and modern atmosphere. Definitely experienced a don't-judge-a-book-by-it's-cover moment. \n\nThe wine that was recommended to me, some Argentinian red wine, was okay. After that I had various glasses of white wine, and I loved it. I'm probably biased though, since red isn't my preferred choice. \n\nService was great. They often came over to see if we needed refills. Bathrooms are located upstairs. I had to scale some steep steps to get there, which felt like an adventure after multiple glasses of wine.
-0oNlErLlU7PQa-TpespdA	I really enjoyed this place! Cozy and soft sofas to sit on, server was on point and seemed very educated on all of the drink options, and even though it was a cool winter night, the fire on the outdoor patio was very warm and the trees were beautiful with the lights strung on them. I had a Frozen Grape martini and it might have been the best one I've ever had. Very crisp, fresh, and over all delicious with a natural grape flavor. This place is a location you could easily go into with jeans on or dressed up. The atmosphere is wonderful and the decor is pretty creative!
-0uEqc2vw1xXtuI_r1xTNg	Me and a friend ended up here for brunch after the restaurant we had originally chosen was too full and we were too hungry to wait. \n\nLet me first start off by saying that the bar tables, were spring loaded. What does that mean? It means that for some bizarre reason, the designer of the restaurant decided to build tables that are on springs....that move when you press on them. This isn't really awesome for eating and drinking. I was spilling and splashing my drink all over the place and It was essentially impossible to rest my elbows or hands on the table without everything moving. I really just am having a hard time understanding the reasoning behind this decision. It seems there are some regular tables in other areas of the restaurant so at least you aren't forced to endure this strange experience. \n\nThe food was also a bit disappointing. I ordered a standard poached eggs with hash browns, sausage and fruit. The eggs were a bit soupy and there weren't very many potatoes that came with the meal. I asked for hot sauce and all they had was Tabasco. I love my eggs with proper good hot-sauce and in my opinion any good breakfast/brunch spot should ensure that have it. The saving grace were the toasted baguettes that came with the meal, perfectly toasted and buttered and the nice assortment of fruit as well. But those items were secondary to what I ordered. \n\nMaybe I just caught this place on a bad-day in terms of the food and I suppose I could have asked to change tables but this experience overall wasn't great and I doubt I will be back.
-0uEqc2vw1xXtuI_r1xTNg	A small restaurant near the eastern end of Roy. There are two types of seating, hard old wooden chairs with backs that surround you on three sides and bar stools at raised tables. The decor is eclectic and anemic. In some ways it feels like a garage sale of items. The food is advertised as tapas and yet, can you really call something tapas if the style is French? Isn't that really more of an amuse bouche, then? Anyway. most of the tapas were nice and the prices were reasonable, with the exception of the beef tartare which on the night we had it, had an off flavour related to the spices. The alcohol prices were a little high, but still acceptable. The soft drink prices apparently were set by someone from Paris or a stripper, because at $4 for a soft drink, I expect someone to be dancing around nearly naked (or at least be on the Champ d'Elysee, with a snooty accented French.) Makes you wonder who is setting the prices, because a glass of milk is just $3, but cost wise is more than any softdrink. Of note, the Fennel salad was excellent. The creme brulee was nicely prepared. The chevre chaud was too sweet for my taste. The salmon was good. But I would skip the tartare. Oh and the Piano man was quite good.
-0uEqc2vw1xXtuI_r1xTNg	Went a Thursday night with a friend, was the last night for our groupon coupon. I don't even know where to start. The restaurant seems to be very confused what tapas. Being server raw veggies and some sort of sour cream dip IS NOT a tapas!! Something so amateurish to serve. That last dish some potato cake that I guess is suppose to be a spin on a Spanish torta, was cold, mushy and left the worst after taste. My friend left with such a bad case of heartburn, they use canned tomatoes for all their dishes and out of the 11 tapas there must have been 7!! \nHowever the service was great! Our waitress was amazing, super attentive.
-0uEqc2vw1xXtuI_r1xTNg	I had brunch here the other day, it was great! The serving was humongous, yet reasonably priced. The omelet was tasty and healthy. The fruit was super fresh. The ambiance and staff were nice, I'll be back!
-0uEqc2vw1xXtuI_r1xTNg	Went in May with a Groupon coupon and it was pretty good and friendly. Fod was Ok for most part....\nStopped by a few weeks ago (in the middle of Summer..) and they were closed for vacation ....\nAs I had another Groupon coupon I called (cell phone..) to reserve last week. The mailbox is full and they don't respo9nd to msg either ... Not sure how long the place is going to last.
-0uEqc2vw1xXtuI_r1xTNg	Le Roy pendu, vive le Roy! Petit restaurant de quartier (quoique...) hyper charmant, on nous reçois ici dans une déco rustique un peu kitch mais qui fontionne très bien. Le menu se compose de plusieurs plat en format tapas et de quelques plats en portion plus généreuse. On offre une carte ecclectique passant du carpaccio de betterave, au risotto en passant par les calmars frits... Mais ça marche. La formulaire simple et complexe à la fois (en gros on peut tout prendre,  ou faire différente combinaison, ou y aller avec des formules déjà faite) vous sera expliqué par la très charmante et gentille hotesse. Elle est d'une gentillesse et tout simplement super sympa. Bon, retournons à la nourriture, les plats sont tous (et je crois les avoir effectivement tous essayer) très réussi. Le boeuf autant en tartare qu'en plat principale y est excellent. \n\nIl faut y retourner régulièrment et encourager ce type d'établissement.
-153AjTW5luZPK4omEujWA	Eisenhower once said, "Some people wanted champagne and caviar when they should have had beer and hot dogs." The man knew what he was talking about. Vegas is a place of flashy exuberance; dripping with neon lights and bronzed blonds dressed in sequenced gowns. Champagne and caviar are as easily accessible as sweet Asian Lucy. Believe me when I say I wasn't in the mood for either. After winning a whole ten bucks on the penny slots, I wanted something good and semi-cheap to celebrate.\n\nAfter meandering the pseudo streets of New York, New York, I settled on Jodi Maroni's Sausage Kingdom. Surprisingly, this little stand had a lot to choose from. There are Sausage sandwiches available from Hot Italian to Polish and Bratwurst to Chicken Pomegranate. There's also the good old fashioned hot dog which I settled on. I decided to get the combo which included fries and drink. The hot dog was good and the french fries were delicious. A simple meal, yes, but it definitely hit the spot AND I had some money left over from the ten bucks I won.\n\nJodi's is located near the "Chrysler building" and the Zumanity entrance. There are a lot of little tables and chairs around to sit and enjoy your meal and it's also a great area to people watch. Definitely a cute little  place. I give it three solid stars.
-153AjTW5luZPK4omEujWA	Always a favorite while at the McCarran Airport. They're andouille sausages are to die for. Meals (dog+fry+drink) can get a bit pricey $9-$10
-153AjTW5luZPK4omEujWA	After eating super rich foods & spending ridiculous amounts of money in Vegas all week, a hot dog lunch was just what we needed.\n\nLocated in New York New York, this quaint little hot dog place has a quality dog & great fries. Two people will leave full for just about $10.00. \n\nA native NYC-er & Chicagoan give it 2 thumbs up.
-153AjTW5luZPK4omEujWA	I've had better hot dogs, namely Coneys in Detroit. But for being hungry, wanting some options, and being a short walk away from MGM Grand, this place is ok in my book.\n\nA good, cheap place to eat if you need some food in your stomach before getting ready and going out to the clubs.
-153AjTW5luZPK4omEujWA	Bleh....I guess.\n\nI had the Chicago-style hot dog and the veggie mix on top was just way too excessive. I couldn't even taste the hot dog anymore because of all the damn toppings. My friend ordered the bratwurst and it was pretty plain tasting, nothing special. Even our sodas were wack -- super syrupy and sweet. Wish I tried some other place before here.
-17RjDnOY9c7IsCcYUjx5Q	Great little thrift store! Clean and organized with friendly staff. Someone has clearly put in time and effort arranging stock items to make them more appealing: creating gift baskets, bundling wine books with glasses and decorative stoppers, setting up tasteful window displays, etc.\n\nStopped in looking for furniture and decor items, got a vase and a basket to place shoes in by the front door, both for under $10- which was great pricing but unfortunately, card purchases under $10 are charged a. $1 transaction fee. Didn't mind because it is run through a charity organization, but it is worth noting.\n\nCashier was friendly and let me know that each day of the week they offer various 25% discounts- one day is military, another is teachers and students, etc. Unfortunately the discount schedule changes weekly, so you can't just stop in on your day of the week. Not sure what the logic behind that is.
-17RjDnOY9c7IsCcYUjx5Q	I will say that this store use to be really good with how much good quality stuff they got.  Now every time i go in I always ask if there closing because they never have anything really. I have been to the store on  eastern  and like it because they're never empty but they are way way overpriced . You would think with the stores being under same organization they would have same prices and stuff. But I am giving 5 stars because when I do go I get awsome service and if I find something it's a really good price not dirt cheap and not Macy's high. Besides this store is closer to me than the other one. But they really need to get more stuff shelves look empty. Overall I like this little place it's  good for the community.
-17RjDnOY9c7IsCcYUjx5Q	I stopped by here after going into Zombie Zone and I was a little surprised to find that the store is pretty run down despite the busy shopping center it is in. They don't really seem to have the selection that Goodwill has, but who's to say you might not find a treasure hidden somewhere? The employees were very friendly so I cannot comment on any employees arguing. I managed to find one brand new burlap sack tote bag but the rest of the items were pretty grim. However, I figured this is for charity so I felt pretty good about my $5 purchase.
-17RjDnOY9c7IsCcYUjx5Q	I just stumbled across this great little thrift shop located in the Albertsons Shopping Center an decided to take a looksee.  \n\nI am always looking for ways to complete my crafts, DIY projects so thrift shopping makes it a lot more convenient and easier on the checkbook.  For one if I mess up there is not much of a loss (just my hurt ego). \n\nI find it surprising on how some of the more well-known second hand stores, price their donations.  There are many times I leave feeling ripped off rather than a smart shopper. Some of the other competitors will give you discount coupons for your donations which helps but otherwise pretty pricey at times.  And I get that it's a business, but lucky form me I have found a great alternative in Catholic Charities. \n\nThey have specials all the time like half off on a specific colored tag or on some occasions $1 shoes if the original pricing is under $5.  They have a display case full on nick-knacks, racks of clothing, shoes, kitchen wear, furniture, electronics and so much more.   I have found some great almost new items to furniture pieces to refurbish or repurpose.\n\nBest of all it is priced right with no sales tax. Sure like any thrift shop, you are not always going to get lucky with great finds, but when you do, at least here you can find the pricing to be fair. \n\nThis place is going to be one of my first choice thirft stores when shoping and donating because I believe they have right concept.
-17RjDnOY9c7IsCcYUjx5Q	I frequent this store, and usually love it!!\n\nIve been here about 10 times and have always found cool things at great prices! For the most part the staff is very nice and helpful. \n\nOn this trip I went after my son and I ate at China One, I went looking for vintage necklaces to no avail. I did find some cheap phone chargers which were awesome! My son seen a dvd player and I decided to buy it. I askes the worker if we could test it out with a dvd and he stated they werent allowed... But assured me it worked bc they test them before they leave the warehouse. Ok, ill buy it I said. We went to check out and I asked the cashier what if it doesnt work? She stated (after swipping my card) that there is an all sales final rule. Ok, I get it its a thrift store, but if im dropping 15$ on a defevtive dvd player itd be nice to bring it back and exchange it. She stated if it didnt work to call and speak to a manager. We get home and I plug it in and try to play a dvd and SURE ENOUGH IT DOESNT WORK!!! So my son starts crying and I call them, this was around 530pm. The same cashier answers and says she remembers us, she says the mgr stepped out and took my number, alas I never got a ohone call. I call this morning and spoke to the manager and right off the bat she was rude. She stated all sales were final and I interjected and explained what happened. She did not care one bit. I went on to say it wasnt right that I paid for a defective dvd player bc her worker wasnt allowed to test it. Of course her rebuttal was "idk who you spoke to but we test everything when asked" well I asked 2 workers and both didnt! She then states I should go buy a dvd cleaner, those dvd ones... Really lady? I just spent 15$ on that and now you want me to go buy a dvd to clean it IN ADDITION TO A REMOTE AND THE CORDS??? Ok, I understand that 15$ may not be a lot to people but im a single mom living off unemployment, I figured coming here would help both of us, this is what happens! She tells me in a very irritated voice "well just bring it back and ill buy it off you" \n\nListen, I dont want my money back, I just want a working dvd player! I shoulda just paid the 30$ to buy a brand new dvd player WITH CORDS AND REMOTE. I LOVE thrift stores but I do not love getting taken advantage of! I could see if I called back months later but I called back within an hour of purchase! \n\nI do like this store but wishes they wouldnt be such sticklers about these types of situations! Everyrhing is DONATED and they cant even be compassionate when they wronged me by not testing it in the first place!
-17RjDnOY9c7IsCcYUjx5Q	I can see by the reviews people who love this store are only giving it 3 stars. This is shocking to me. If you love a store one would think you would give it a five star.\nI am giving it a three star, not because I don't like the store, but because I only went there one time. I got a bender for my granddaughter, and to my surprise it was broken. It didn't run. I have never been to a thrift shop that didn't test the things before they try to sell something. You cannot return..To bad for me and to bad for them. They lost a great customer the first day.  Don't let my problem keep you from visiting this store, just be careful...Have a happy day..
-17RjDnOY9c7IsCcYUjx5Q	YELP 365 CHALLENGE 2014-(318/365) "Thrifty Treasures"\n\nWhen it comes to poppin' tags, Savers and Goodwill are usually the first things that come to mind. Another place is Catholic Charities.\n\nThis location is pretty small and pretty organized. Aide from clothes, they got tons of random stuff for your home, sporting goods, toys, furniture, and more...pretty neat place to look for costume accessories too if there's an upcoming Yelp event that we can dress up for!\n\nThe people here are very nice and friendly, and always ready to answer any questions you may have. They also give you a heads up on any specials they are running. On this visit, they had 50% off all clothes in the store. You may just find what you need for your ugly sweater party here!....;) ALOHA!!!\n\nShaka Meter:  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  3
-17RjDnOY9c7IsCcYUjx5Q	Staff is nice, store is a little run down. They have some shopping carts, but they're so bent and grubby I wondered if the homeless had been using them prior to Catholic Charities getting them.  Prices were OK - $7.00 for a poly-print women's dress (just a suggestion, they might want to take the $5.00 Walmart price tag off before pricing the dress higher).  My husband picked up a number of hawaiian print shirts which were cool.  Oddly enough, we were trying to find a used Bible and were surprised they didn't have any (or any books for that matter) at a Catholic thrift store. Overall, this place is just OK - I don't think I'd make a special trip or anything to come here.
-17RjDnOY9c7IsCcYUjx5Q	Hmm where do I start? First of all, I told myself I'd never shop here again after the only two times I'd gone, the employees were ARGUING WITH EACH OTHER, at checkout, while customers were in line! That's right, 2 separate occasions, two different days and different employees each time. Really? I recently went back with my mother and she asked the cashiers (who were just standing behind the register talking to each other) where the women's jeans were and the male cashier rolls his eyes and goes "over there ma'am... By the pillows..." Then when my mom walked away he let out the hugest huff I'd ever heard, like he was SUPER inconvenienced to pause his conversation to speak to us and let us know where they had moved the jeans. I was PISSED but so surprised that all I could do was give him a death stare.\n\nProblem is I ALWAYS leave with something I never thought I needed and their prices are L-O-W, low. I have an 8mo old and infant clothes are only .25 a piece! Goodwill's baby clothes are a minimum of $1 and they charge about $3 for a plain white onsie... I can go to Ross and buy new for that. They have different sales everyday, half off certain tag colors or furniture for example but just get ready for the cashiers to call a manager to MAKE SURE that even though the sale of the day is "50% off ALL clothing" that this shirt is in fact 50% off... Shaking my head.\n\nOVERALL, come here for a great DEAL but get ready to DEAL with attitude and lots of confusion at checkout.
-17RjDnOY9c7IsCcYUjx5Q	Sadly, over the last few years this store has completely changed and not for the better! I think that anyone who has shopped there from the time they opened in 2011 until now would agree that it's gone from a great priced, well stocked, boutiquish feel with awesome customer service to a dirty, unorganized, unfriendly junk store!! I used to prefer going there to the Goodwill but not anymore, over the last couple of years they've lost all but 2 of their best employees and their new management team doesn't seem to know how to successfully run a thrift store.  They had an awesome Retail Director that opened the 2 stores but after the Monsignor passed away back in 2013, I heard they lost more than half of their management and the people that were hired to take the place for retail.... well, it speaks for itself. Check it out for yourself, especially if you haven't been there in a couple of years.... you'll be shocked too!!
-17RjDnOY9c7IsCcYUjx5Q	Great staff the prices are good found some amazing soccer jerseys at a very low price probably rare jerseys
-1sjyJNHTqFgM7GZGK7L7A	Located in the basement of the Chase Building, this florist shop is definitely one of the best florists that service the Phoenix downtown area.   Their bouquets are gorgeous and range from classic,exotic to contemporary.  Great service and Judy, the owner, takes care of any of your needs including any personal touches that you'd like to add to your order.\n\nOnly reason why I knock a star is that I wish that they had more of a selection of fresh flowers for people who just want to buy flowers on a whim.
-1sjyJNHTqFgM7GZGK7L7A	I just received a delivery of flowers from here. The petals are falling off the daisies  and the other flowers are half dead. Some have brown curling tips. Two flowers have no petals at all.  It looks at least 5 days old. I tried calling the florist and got a message that the mailbox was full. You may get fresh flowers in the shop but, delivery flowers are old.\nChanging to 4 stars for customer service. I called again and spoke to Judy. A new bouquet was send and the old one taken.  \nChanging back to one star. The "new" bouquet was just as old and will have to be thrown out today. Flowers from a florist should last up to a week and sometimes longer if you change the water every day and trim the ends every second day.
-1sjyJNHTqFgM7GZGK7L7A	Plenty of actual competent and professional Florists. My experience here reflected neither:\nWas told delivery was made when it wasn't - ok fine. Somehow could not contact driver (yeah right) to see about the delay. They lied saying the Building security won't let deliveries up (they do). Girlfriend's coworker saw the flowers outside on the ground, which I must assume was the reason for the delay. Flowers did not include what was discussed (they fell out?). Manager refused to take any responsibility, or just be straight with me, just that she is busy.
-1sjyJNHTqFgM7GZGK7L7A	For the sake of being objective, I will state the facts about my purchase from here.  I did not receive my flowers.  I also did not receive a refund.
-1sjyJNHTqFgM7GZGK7L7A	DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE. Let me explain.\n\nFirst of all, I order a lot of flowers. We do events all over the country so this is not anything new to me. A week before our event, I called and placed an order over the phone with the florist. There was no charge to our card, I thought perhaps they will charge it the day of the event. The morning of the delivery I called the florist and they explained to me that they lost my order and there was nothing on the books. Luckily, I was speaking with the same woman who I placed the order from and she acknowledged it was her fault and she upgraded us to the next size bouquet. Great. Fast forward a week later, we notice there are 2 charges on the credit card for the same thing. I call her back and explain to her we need this charge reverse as soon as possible because they have double charged us. She assures me that they will take care of it same day and send me an email confirmation. I am in New York and they are in Arizona so I leave that night, only to come in the next morning with no email confirmation. I am still trying to get the second charge reversed however, they only answer their phone half the time. \n\nDO NOT ORDER FROM HERE.
-1sjyJNHTqFgM7GZGK7L7A	My advice for future purchases is do not buy something online because it will not look anything like the picture shown. I hate to give them 1 star but I was not satisfied what so ever with the purchase I had made. I also upgraded the bouquet $10 hoping they would add more flowers. Instead I got more greens and less flowers. I paid $80 total for something totally different than what I picked online with less flowers. Picture posted to give you an idea.
-1sjyJNHTqFgM7GZGK7L7A	I wish I looked at Yelp before I ordered because I would not have ordered from here. One of my best friends shared a tradition w me that her mom would send her flowers when she started a new job. Well her mom past away and when she started a new position I knew I had to keep this going for her! I selected flowers online that had the color rose of her new company and pink carnations which is the flower of her sorority (something very important to her and that she is still active w as an alumna). Neither flower made it into what they sent. I know you may run out of something but you shouldn't be able to send a totally separate arrangement. To top it off they spelt my name wrong on the card though it is typed out on their website. Seriously disappointed
-1sjyJNHTqFgM7GZGK7L7A	You need to seriously consider updating your google page because it says you are open today from 9-5....and just lost two potential customers as a result. Get your act together
-1sjyJNHTqFgM7GZGK7L7A	We sent flowers to our mom for mother's day. We ordered them in advance and to be delivered on the Friday before mother's day so she could enjoy them all weekend. It's mother's day, the end of the day, and she still hasn't received any flowers. The customer service representative was nice but only offered to put in an inquiry in with the florist. Their customer service was unable to help me. I have no answers, no flowers, and am down some money.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	This place is new to the Centennial area and we were ready for some Friday night sushi and thought we would give it a try.  There were probably 7 or eight tables full with customers.  The décor is a zero.  Looks like they just moved into a four wall spot and just put a sushi bar and some tables in there.  The ceiling looks unfinished as they didn't put a drop down ceiling at all which I think would help the look of the place. Definitely don't be expecting an ambiance.  \n\nWe ordered edemame, ebi, spicy California roll and chicken fried rice.  Everything was really good.  The fried rice had slivers of almond in it which was different but really tasty.  I'm not sure if I have ever had almonds in my fried rice but it was a unique touch. I might just come back for that alone!  \n\nThe service was an "eh". An older woman was our server and seemed to be the only one working the tables and she didn't seem all that friendly or maybe she just didn't know English very well.  Minus the ambiance and service, the food was good and we will for sure give it another whirl just for the eats. ;)
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Tofu Hot pot was delicious! I love soft tofu in soup! Was eager to eat so I don't take pic but you got to try it!!! Everything we ordered was on point!!! I don't know why they only get 3 star rating?! Service was great and the ambiance was welcoming and beautiful. We will return again!! Happy Hour 11am - 3 pm Mon thru Friday!!!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Not toooooo shabby. But the only upsides i could give were the Shrimp Tempura crunch roll, and the tasty chicken Katsu. \n\nI walked in with my girlfriend around noon to have some AYCE goodness. 21.95 is a bit high, but a few dollars isn't too big of a deal. But my experience wouldn't bring me back. There were 2 or 3 other people in the restaurant, and while we were eating, a few groups came in, sat down and left without eating. I have no idea why.\n\nWe started off with miso soup. My girlfriend was fond of it, as for me it tasted a bit runny and a little on the downside of flavor, but it was the right temperature and it was just ok. The sushi was fair and like i said, the crunch roll was tasty and had to be the best roll that lunch. They do not have half orders, I prefer half orders because if there were to be a roll i did not like, there would be a small portion to finish, and also half orders get you to try all of the different kinds of sushi they have to offer. So this place is better for groups.\n\nService was definitely fast, the lady who served us was nice and friendly but she seemed rushed in a way that you would see as if you were late to class. I don't like seeing someone in a hurry or having that panicking look.\n\nOverall just an A-OK Not really much to say about this place. I may come back with a bigger group or find a different AYCE sushi place.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Yum!! My husband and I have been here twice and loved each one. Small place, friendly staff, varied menu. My husband's new favorite thing is the jalapeño roll. I really enjoyed the crab and cheese roll. We also had chicken ramen, cucumber salad (so good!!!), and the miso soup. Not a fan of their soup, but everything else was wonderful!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	I'm rating based on the service. When we walked in we didn't know what to do. No one was in the front & we didn't know if we were supposed to seat ourselves. There were a lot of paper menus in the front & when we got seated & menus weren't given to us, we were confused if we were supposed to take them with us from the front. Our waitress ended up getting us menus after taking care of another table. She didn't ask if we wanted drinks for quite some time. I ended up getting the lunch special & my boyfriend got the AYCE. At first I didn't realize that there were no utensils at our table & I had to wait literally 10 minutes to ask for chopsticks. It took another 7-10 minutes to get the ginger/wasabi AFTER we got our sushi. The sushi was okay. My boyfriend enjoyed a lot of the rolls. It was only us and 2 other families so I really don't understand where our waitress was going. She'd disappear a couple of times. Tables next to us were putting their empty plates on top of tables next to them because no plates were being picked up. Ok sushi but probably not coming back.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Was on our way to Henderson to another sushi spot (Daisho) when we remembered seeing red ginseng had started doing AYCE.. so we stopped.. glad we did!! At first glance thought it might be closed.. windows looked dark and it was 10:00 but they were open and we were the only ones there.. thought about leaving just because if nobody else is brave enough there's usually a reason.. glad we stayed!! This is a family run place.. the older lady waits tables.. I think she's the wife and owner.. the husband and son are the chefs. She was very sweet and accommodating.. always offering offering more and I eat a lot so that says something..\n\nThe Jalapeno Bombs (aka poppers) are the best in town.. as are the monkey brain and the First Class roll.. All off the charts good.. Everything was great thats what was crazy.. they didnt miss!! The food quality is top notch.. as this place was a la carte and still serves a la carte quality at ALCE prices.. I've been to ALOT of off strip sushi bars in town.. Oyshi, Goyemon, Kaya, Sushi Loca, I Love Sushi.. and this beats all of em!!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	This place is great, my gf was having surgery at centennial hospital and this was across from it.  Went in and service was friendly with reasonable prices, its a shame I dont live near it. Food was delicious sushi was great and fast!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	I ordered the kimchi seafood hot pot and it was the most disgusting dish I have ever tasted. It was a bowl of frozen and rotten tasting red mess. There were literally three calamari rings and four tentacles with firm old tofu and rotten tasting kimchi (rotten not fermented). The bowl was full of what they called fishcakes, but it resembled Styrofoam popcorn packing material and tasted like gooey dough. The dry white rice was served on a large white plastic plate on the side. I ate a quarter the dish and had to stop because I started having a stomach ache. The one star is for the attentive service by the servers. Definitely not coming back.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	We are always down to try a new sushi place. We dropped in here on a weekday for a late lunch. We were one of 2 tables in the place.\n\nFrom the beginning, it was a lackluster experience. Table for four, including 2 kids. We were seated and not given any menus for over 5 minutes. Any mother knows with little ones, service must be efficient as kids do not tolerate long waiting times. The waitress dropped off the menus and ran off. She came back and wanted our food order. When we told her we were still thinking, she immediately ran off without even giving me a breath to tell her our drink order.  She brought our drinks but forgot one. We gave her our food order and sat. We ordered a veggie tempura appetizer. That came to the table. It was a big platter of tempura but accompanied by the most tasteless dipping sauce. Plus, they only serve it with the tiniest amount considering the dish it was paired with. I also ordered a cucumber salad but never received it so I cannot comment on what it tasted like.  Next we ordered 2 chicken ramen noodles for the entrees. Those arrived and were huge. The broth had no flavor and the chicken was cold. It had clearly just been sliced up and thrown in. It too had no flavor. I thought it would be grilled or marinated or something. Definitely not worth the $9 price, even Top Ramen tastes better. My kids had a veggie noodle dish. I give her credit for getting that out to us quickly, but she did not give them any utensils.\n\nBottom line, horrible service with nothing to excuse it e.g being busy or understaffed. And blah food. \n\nNext time we will stick with our usual sushi joint down the road.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	I stopped in during the hours of lunch for some sushi. I sat down knowing that I was ready for the AYCE sushi deal for about $22. I forgot the name of the 6 rolls that I indulged in, but they were all delicious. The service was prompt, and friendly. I will be back for more!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	The sushi is really good, but it's kinda pricy. The customer service is kinda weird too. Overall it's a decent place to go though.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	I've been going here every once in a while since they have opened and it's great everytime. Idk why people are bitching about ramen on here, if you want that go to china town and get some real ramen. Pho!! \nAnyways this place is always fresh and this old couple really works their ass off. Place is always clean and the only other place on the north side that does AYCE other then krazy sushi.  Don't hesitate to stop here def good little joint
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Came for the lunch special, service was good, food was great. I recommend the bulgogi chicken, also got a spicy tuna roll which was good. Need to come back for dinner and give that a try.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	My boyfriend and I went there for lunch and it is pretty dark and lonely. We had the special of a miso soup, salad, and four rolls for $12.99 which we thought wasn't bad. The sushi was good couldn't finish my food. Service was good they didn't take long and were polite. I have noticed that a lot of sushi places are doing the same special so I'd rather try a new place then go back.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	This is the best place I know for california-type Sushi. Reasoably priced as well. The Dinner All you can eat is around $27. For Sushi and other high quality japanese items I think that is very reasobale.\n\nThe store has a kind of dark feeling to it and the waitress is "asia friendly" if you know what I mean. But hey: the food is awesome! And that is what counts first and foremost.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Their Big island roll is delicious!!! I drive 20 minutes out of my way to go get it.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	This place is great. We have gone there a couple times the service is not the fastest but worth the money . Try the lobster roll \n The place  doesn't have great atmosphere but the sushi is good
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Sushi is so-so, a bit pricey for so-so sushi. But worst of all this place smells like a dirty dish rag that has been sitting out in the baking sun. The smell is very off putting and ruined our experience. Also the service was so-so.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	As an AYCE place, I would say it's decent but as compared to others when considering price, quality, service as a whole I can think of others in the area that rank higher. That being said, this was my second time here and I had no major complaints. My daughter thought the lemonade wasn't too good because it literally was a few lemons squeezed in water and was tart....but I kinda liked it. The stuffed tomato was really good.\n\nI would like to see more cucumber wrapped items however....
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	This is my first review ever on Yelp. I just had to share my experience in this place. Best sushi experience in my life and I've been to about hundred sushi places so far. The reason I like this place is for their special all you can eat sushi. I only had lunch special, they also offer dinner. This special includes everything on the menu including appetizers as much as you want, all kinds of sushi, rolls, special rolls and so on, plus one mochi ice cream. The best part is that it's not actually a buffet but everything is made to order. So the food is very fresh and really good quality. I didn't have anything that wasn't good. The first time I was there with my husband and we were ordering little by little because we didn't know how much we can eat and there you aren't supposed to leave anything. The second time I brought my mom and ordered everything at once knowing exactly how much we would eat so there was no waiting for food at all. Not many people know about this place so they have a lot of tables available. The price for the all you can eat lunch is $22.00 which is very reasonable for what you are getting, it's what two rolls will cost anywhere else anyway. Other reviews mentioned that the service is "Asia friendly" and that's true, however the quality of food outweighed it. The second time the service was better. I recommend this place just be patient with your waitress.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Excellent. Having a great lunch with my daughter. Service is fast and friendly. Owners came to check on the tables. Very nice
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	We went on a Sunday afternoon for AYCE during lunch which runs you $21.95 for 60min time limit. For appetizers we ordered soft shell crab which had too much tempura batter and no flavor.  We also got the vegetable and shrimp tempura. Okay so I know tempura is deep fried but I never had tempura that left my fingers saturated in oil before.\nMy husband and I both ordered 4 rolls each, his all coming from the spicy roll list. I got the shrimp lover which was alright, it smelled and tasted really fishy...I also ordered the lobster roll which was sweet and the jackpot roll which incl their special house sauce (ponzu sauce) both which were good. But my absolute favorite is the the lovely honey roll, they use cucumber instead of seaweed with yam yam sauce. I was considering ordering only that for the rest of the meal but wanted to try other things.\nThe atmosphere was nice, the place was pretty dead so our waitress acted as our personal hostess, overall it was okay.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Not your hoppin sushi bar but the quality is great. If u want a nice quiet sushi place, this is it. The service was great
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Service was really slow. \n1. Had to wait almost 10 minutes to get our drinks. \n2. To place an order for an alacarte we still had to write it down as if it was an all you can eat. So instead of placing the order already we had to wait another 10 minutes to get her to pick up our paper.\n3. Ordered garlic edamame and it she gave it to us as regulars edamame. \n4. The Nigiris was very bland. \n5. Not just that, the server forgot the name of one of the role. It was sexy girl and she's just said sexy something..
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Sushi was pretty good, and fresh. They also have oyster shooters which I love! The menu has alot of options and I like the fact that they dont put too much rice. I wouldve given this place a full 5 star if the service wasnt so slow. Overall, I would come back again. Looks like their lunch menu is pretty good. Btw I love their ice tea. Its Korean style.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	I never want to come back here, which is so disappointing because their location before this one was wonderful.  My boyfriend really wanted to come, since he was craving it so badly.\n\nThe waitress there didn't even ask us whether we wanted a booth or sushi bar table, she just assumed we wanted the bar table.  She kept coming back and forth to us wondering if we were ready to order.  Come on give us some time to at least look at all your selections...  They only serve main entrees during lunch hour, which is strange because I wanted something else that's not sushi related.  The appetizers were WAY too over salted.  The edamame was covered in salt and half of them were cold and half hot.  The seaweed miso soup was just way too overpowering of saltiness, had like 1 tofu and 1 seaweed in it.\n\nThe only thing keeping me from not going 1 star was the sushi rolls.  My most sincere compliments to the sushi chefs because it was delicious.   I got the tiger roll and 007 roll.  My boyfriend did all you can eat and he thoroughly enjoyed the food as well.  \n\nAnd lastly, the waitress never asked us if we'd like any water until we were almost done with our food.  She also never mentioned that a refill on hot tea would be an extra charge..   And she kept hovering over us like she wants us out and to hurry up and pay the bill.  There was nobody there but another couple.  Not sure why she wanted us to hurry up... Whatever, regardless never coming back.  I'll go to a closer sushi place by my house thanks.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	I was delighted to discover the new location of Narita Sushi bar now with the updated name of Red Ginseng Narita Sushi & BBQ.  I had enjoyed eating at their old Cheyenne & Tenaya location for many years. Howard & Emo are now in a new location with twice the square feet inside & located in the shopping center just South across the street from Centennial Hospital. I was not surprised to find that Howard continues his tradition of providing the largest size servings of sushi in Las Vegas with quality product. Their new location has added an "All You Can Eat" option plus Emo's Korean Barbecue. Check them out for quality sushi at the best price in town!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Slow service, waitress overcharged me (didn't fight it), food was so so, wouldn't recommend it.  Kind of sad, I was looking forward to another sushi place here in the NW...
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	This is the worst sushi place ive ever been to in my life. Taste awful. service was so slow, one waitress, one sushi chef. will never ever go back or recommend this place.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	I was so excited to order from this new place so I placed an order to go.\n\nService was friendly and I waited for my order.\n\nWhen I got home I found a big 'ol sloppy mess!\n\n$18 for a dry tiny piece of tasteless salmon, gross dark chicken parts, globby rice, overcooked katsu with NO SAUCE and they forgot my veggies which came with the order!\n\nSadly did not get what I expected. \n\nNot coming back:(
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Showed up an hour before they closed for AYCE and was told its "take out only."  That's bullcrap. I guess they didn't want anyone to dirty the dishes, that they are too lazy to clean. They should be more clear on when the dinning room closes. Never tried to go back. Found a better place closer to my house. Customer service is crap.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Great little sushi place. I was there around 3:30 and they let me order off of the lunch menu. For $12.95 you get a salad, miso soup, 4 pieces of sashimi, and your choice of two rolls. Excellent value and very fresh. I will definitely be back again!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	My mom and I actually found this place accidentally while looking for another sushi restaurant. We figured it was really close to the house, so why not give it a try. We were greeted and we sat at the bar. The lady that sat us ( I think was the owner) was a bit pushy at first but very attentive. We ordered the tiger , pink roll and samurai . All were great and you can notice that he takes great pride in what he does. The sushi tasted very fresh. My mother ordered the ramen soup . It was good and all the vegetables tasted fresh. The restaurant itself was clean and well kept ( they've been at this location lil over a year) . The temperature was 110f today so when we walked in, it was cool and shaded. I will definitely be back. Next time I will try the Korean BBQ.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Red Ginseng is fabulous sushi. Always fresh with beautiful presentation. Will come back often
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	The service is a little different than I'm use to from other sushi bars but once I figured it out I was set. I ordered everything under the sun. My husband and I tried things that we've never thought would be good but the owner promised themed be good and they were. Will be back many more times to comes.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	This place is good. The have a good deal by 2 rolls and get one free. Their rolls are cheap and come with 8 not the usual 4. Try it out for yourself
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	I consider myself a sushi fan, not sushi snob mind you. With that said this place was well below what I expect for sushi quality.  I did the AYCE lunch special.  The price was good but the quality....not great.  I don't expect top tier sushi at AYCE price but nothing was very good.  Everyone was very nice and maybe I caught them on a off day but I won't be back
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Were to begin... No one welcome us in, we had to sit ourselves. I ordered the dinner combination chicken bulgogi and shrimp tempera. Their was no taste at all... Should've went to panda next door and  prices is way too high.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Howard is an awesome sushi chef! His sashimi & sushi is always top quality and very generous portions. A must try is his hand rolls!! The spicy scallop & the salmon skin roll are the best! I can't rate the service because we always get our order to go, but they are always friendly!\nI'm so happy he has moved to the Centennial area!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	We ordered 2 bento boxes here only to find out that the amount of food they give you is enough for 2 people to split one box!\n\nOur meals came with two huge rolls, 4 pieces of sashimi, tempura vegetables, soup, and hot tea.  GREAT deal for $13!!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	YUM!  Another great outing.  Terrific fish, great sushi, sashimi, and rolls.  Can't wait to get back here.  TREMENDOUS value for the $.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Best thing I ate here...ginger! And it was just regular, not the fresh kind either. Thoroughly disappointed w the lackluster bland nigris, heavy handed sauce saturated rolls and the awkward fake friendly service! Think other reviews pointed out their flaws already so I don't even wanna elaborate. Wish they were decent but looks like I'll continue to look for a good sushi  lunch place.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	I don't know why it's called Sushi & BBQ when all they have to serve is sushi.\nIf they do serve any sort of BBQ, I was not brought a menu for such options.\n\nTheir drink menu is just some pictures of bottles, no price listings. I know beer is pretty self explanatory, but for people that don't know too much about sake, like me, it would be nice for a regular menu to see descriptions and what quality it is. Also when I asked for a bottle, they said that they don't have it. Why is it on the menu then? If you don't sell whole bottles, don't have a "picture menu" with whole bottles. \n\nThe sushi was decent, I got the Rocky Mt. Sushi roll. It was good, but not $16 good. They put everything on huge plates to make it look like you get big servings but don't fool yourself, it's still just a roll. \n\nThe waitress wasn't very attentive. After sitting there for 15 minutes, I had to summon her over to bring the check. (I'm the only one in the restaurant) Actually, she never even brought the check, I just handed her money cause I was trying to get out of there as quick as possible.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	I feel like I walked into the twilight zone after my dinner experience here. I should have known it was going to be a bad experience judging by the one customer they had sitting in their restaurant. \n\nFirst off, the busser sat us at a table and threw down dinner settings that were messily scattered next to the table next to it. The server took forever to take our order and when we told her we wanted to order AYCE, she gave us a piece of paper to mark what we wanted. This took another 5 minutes for her to come back even after she acknowledged that we were ready to order.\n\nThe fish for the sushi was actually decent but the rice was hard and stale. They didn't even put the wasabi in the nigiri like they normally do. The chicken skewers looked like they grilled up chicken breast and shoved them on to the skewers; not to mention they were extremely dry and flavorless. \n\nBy the end of dinner we noticed we were never brought several items we ordered. We were also charged $8 for a pot of tea, where normally we would be charged for a cup of tea with unlimited refills.\n\nThe bottom line is: DO NOT COME HERE!\n\nService was terrible. The interior decoration was dark, gloomy and awkward.  You can find a better sushi restaurant experience else where. Trust me. This was the worst AYCE sushi experience I have ever had. Save yourself the time, trouble and money.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	I always feel bad giving low ratings but I hope it helps Red Ginseng search for ways to improve. With that said, everything was prepared well, they definitely have experience in that regard, but unfortunately the fish was the least fresh I've ever eaten. There is either an issue with their supplier or the way they store it. I hope things improve.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Had AYCE lunch here. We were promptly seated and served drinks. Appetizers came out quick. Our rolls were very large and nice looking. The staff was very pleasant and quick to check on us. Plenty of rolls to choose from. Can be a bit slow as there was only one chef while we were here. Look forward to coming back.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Went in 7:20pm on Friday, only two couples there, plenty of empty tables. The server asked us to wait to be seated. Unclear why, as most employees were standing around, some staring at us. Left after the server asked us for the third time to "wait a second" while something was being done to prepare a table. Nope.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	My gf and I went on a Tuesday evening and it was really good. I believe that this is a small family owned business, wife was our waitress and husband is the sushi chef. Not real busy so we were seated right away by the hostess/busboy, wasn't bad seating but wish they would have given us the option. No biggie though. The ambiance is very casual and welcoming, never felt uncomfortable. Once seated, she (the wife) was really nice when greeting us, and we received waters almost instantly. The menu is organized and easy to read, and the alcohol menu is conveniently on the table at each seat. We decided to go with the garlic edamame for an appetizer, which was good but nothing fancy. The gf ordered the sexy girl roll, which she enjoyed and looked great. I went with the AYCE with a Asahi beer and was not disappointed. I pretty much ordered every type of roll and everything was delicious, came out in a timely manner, and looked wonderful. The price was more than appropriate for what we ordered, and everyone was real nice to us as we left. All in all it was a good experience, would recommend to anyone looking for good food with a casual atmosphere.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	I really am a fan of this little sushi place! The first time I walked in you can hear the lively music. There was a few people there. It is a bit small, but it does have plenty of tables and a bar area you can sit at. I believe that this is a family owned restaurant. The husband and son are the sushi chefs and the lady is his wife. I like family owned places.\n\nThe lady there is very sweet and she tries her very best to be fast and efficient with seating you and getting your orders out to you. My boyfriend and I ordered the all you can eat, $21.95. There were plenty of sushi rolls you can pick from, you can't do half orders, so it might be good for a group of people! \n\nThe appetizers were good! Shrimp tempura and chicken katsu, came out freshly fried. The soup did its job for me. It wasn't plain, but it wasn't filled with flavor. It was just okay.\n\nThe rolls were quite delicious. We loved the different shrimp tempura based rolls, so yummy! It didn't take long for them to make, but it wasn't fast either. It took a little bit of time. They were also elegantly done. Not just slapped together. They looked like art when they were served to us. I like that touch. We don't get the sashimi.. which is weird, why get sushi when you don't eat it raw right? Oh well. So I cannot really rate how those were. As for the rolls, they were delicious and came with around 8-9 pieces, good amount in my opinion. \n\nAfter about 4 huge rolls and appetizers, we were stuffed. There wasn't any dessert on the menu, so I asked if ice cream or mochi came with the all you can eat! The lady said yes it does.. it doesn't hurt to ask, right?! So we had the green tea ice cream. It wasn't a lot but it was just the right amount of sweet to satisfy my sweet tooth. \n\nThere are plenty of other things on the menu besides sushi, so we will be back for something else on the menu! Maybe the lunch specials :) The only reason I am giving this place a 4 is because I heard from my brother is that the service can be slow when it gets quite busy, but like I said.. family owned. They don't hire professional waiters, but they do their best for their customers. I admire that they try for their business. Will come back here again!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Red Ginseng is very well worth the money you pay for. The quality is very good and the service is outstanding. I highly recommend the Golden Philadelphia roll (the typical Philadelphia roll but it gets lightly fried). Among the other notable dishes I've had include the Popcorn Lobster and Spider Roll.  The salmon roll was also very yummy. Be sure to save some room for dessert, the green tea moochi is a great finishing touch to the end of the meal. The presentation is always very appealing and it really makes the food and experience. \nThe appetizers are good. I had the vegetable tempura which is freshly fried and had just enough batter- not too much or too little.\nThe service is outstanding. It is a very organized ordering system, you get the menu and a ordering sheet. Order what you want and it comes very quickly. You can tell that it is a family run establishment by the pride they have serving you. It can get a little hectic when they do get busy, but it is definitely worth a bit of wait for the food.  I personally like sitting at the bar area of the restaurant because the chef will talk to you and make recommendations based on what you order. Remember, it is AYCE, so maybe a little time to relax between dishes will work to your favor. \nI am originally from Northern New Jersey, right across the river from Manhattan. I can honestly say that Red Ginseng beats most, if not all, the sushi places I've been too. The quality and the service you get here beats many places that you might pay double or triple for on or around the Strip and other cities. I highly recommend a visit here.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	This is my go-to sushi place now! Every time we go, the food is fresh and delicious! I love the shrimp tempura and the jalapeño bomb. It's definitely a hidden gem!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Amazing sushi great service amazing tempura rolls such a variety delicious mushi ice cream and open late which is great for nights out with friend highly recommend!!!!!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Came here for the first time with my boyfriend. And we FREAKIN LOVED IT!  I think my fav. Roll was the baked salmon roll. But everything was so good.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Great sushi !! My husband and I just ate here for the first time and we got the AYCE . What a great price for great food!! They have a great varity of  rolls and the customer service was awesome! The sushi chief even came out to our table to ask how we liked everything .  The Japanese Lasagna  was the best we have ever had!! Impressed!!!!!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	They are not a la carte anymore, but all you can eat, so I decided to try it for lunch. \n\nI started with appetizers - \nsoftshell crab - good batter. It was served with tempura sauce which I didn't prefer over ponzu so I just ate it plain.\nseaweed salad- standard and fine\nstuffed jalapeno- this was good actually, nice crispness and good flavor\nmonkey brain - this seemed interesting since it said crispy banana with crab and masago. I was expecting a banana chip, but it was a battered slice of banana. I did not like this texture. \nfire cracker- I normally enjoy this crispy rice with spicy tuna, but what they did here was make a rice ball coat it in panko and fried it up a bit. It never got crispy and was just oily and mushy inside. The texture was so off putting I couldn't eat that rice and hid it in a napkin. They need to toast the rice crisp in a oven to achieve that delicious crisp. \n\nPortions were big on appetizers so its a sharing thing. Each thing had 4 pcs when I was expecting 2. \n\nNigiri - \nThe cuts were actually nicely done, the fish to rice ratio was good. Unfortunately, the sumeshi was very wet, mushy and was not seasoned. I would have not served that. I sat on most items so that the water would evaporate a little. \nGarlic tuna, albacore and yellowtail were all very fresh. The super white tuna was OK. Scallop with masago was good. \n\nI got one roll, it was a no rice roll and unfortunately was served the wrong thing the soy paper version vs the one covered in cucumber and radish. It was alright, but I know the crispy cukes would have made it better.\n\nI got a salmon skin hand roll and it came with a gob of crab mix! I was a bit upset at this, I just picked it out and threw it in a napkin. Who puts crab on salmon skin?! \n\nService was friendly and nice, but it was inconsistent. There were times she was no where to be found to ask for more drink so I sat empty a few times. You order with a paper menu and I found my pen was gone after the first round. \n\nIt's a shame. Their cutting and freshness here is good, but that was some awful rice that day. I don't ever ever ball up food in a napkin and that happened on this visit.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	My husband and I were on our way to a different restaurant and discovered this new sushi location was open! Yay! \n\nThe staff and the food were both great. the one little wish that I have for this place is to someday soon offer an All You Can Eat price. :-)
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	One star cause.i had to choose it. First time here and No stars for this place. Service was slow, food was not great at all. Miso soup was bland, shrimp tempura tastes like it was frozen and then fried, and very oily. we ordered 4 different kind of sushi and they all had sarachi sauce top....gross! Server kept getting plates mixed up at tables. Will never come back here.   Lastly, they served water with lemon already in it.  Lemons can contaminate the water why would they put it In before serving.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Had lunch there with my son and he ordered the Ramen And I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki plate, pretty basic menu items that are usually "safe choices" to order when trying out an Asian restaurant we have never tried and one which had such very mixed and varying reviews even from close friends and family (most who told us not to eat there!). We walked in on a Friday during the lunch hour into an empty restaurant, this restaurant is a few doors down from Buffalo Wild Wings & Panda Express, both of those restaurants were pretty busy! After ordering our food it finally came out after almost 35 mins (the restaurant was still empty) my son didn't like his Ramen at all and my Chicken Teriyaki was the worst I have ever had, very dry and the sauce was very bland and needed salt, soy sauce, something!!! It was so bad we just asked for the check, didn't finish after 2 bites and left.  The restaurant was still empty but all of the restaurants in that plaza were very busy, again this was a Friday at lunchtime. For an Asian Korean restaurant to screw up Ramen and a basic Chicken Teriyaki is pretty bad! Won't be going back, if you can mess up basic Chicken Teriyaki and a bowl of Ramen, I don't trust that they know what they are doing with sushi!! Their sign says BBQ, their menu doesn't have it listed!!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	If you like Screaming O sauce, don't even bother coming here. I have been about half dozen times now and doubtful I'll be back.\n\nThe quality is in the decent-to-average range. The service is lacking but decent. The prices are a bit higher than should be for this establishment but not too far out of the range considering it's location and lack of any other decent sushi close by. There is a standard selection of sushi.\n\nI have gone here because it's so close to my house, not necessarily because it's my top choice.  \n\nLas Vegas seems to be the market for Screaming O sauce. I've tried to order it every single time I have come in. The first few times they made something kind of close or I mixed it myself. Then I think I must have received  a new sushi chef one night because it was perfect! I tried coming back a few times hoping to get him again and I've haven't seen him since. \n\nI went there tonight, made sure to order my Screaming O sauce before I even put in my order, it was ignored. Asked for it again. The new chef was stopped by the lady in charge and was told to tell me I couldn't have it without ordering a whole order. Fine, I said I would pay for a side of it. Answer was no, had to order all of it... Couldn't just get the sauce. Whatever, asked for the key ingredients and mixed it myself. Not the same or nearly as good as real Screaming O sauce.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Disappointing.\n\nWalked into a virtually empty restaurant, one other table. Waitress wanted to seat us right next to them, we asked for a corner table but she said those were reserved (not a huge deal but usually reserved tables are noted?)\n\nStarted with a bowl of miso soup. It tasted like tap water. \n\nNext up: Garlic tuna: fish was oddly chewy, room temperature, not a lot of flavor. Made me wonder if I'd be getting food poisoning later.\n\nPhiladelphia roll: also bland. So much so that we asked for the rest of our order to go, so that we could simply stop eating without being rude or complaining.\n\nWaitress seemed a bit under the weather. No one ever came in for that reserved table while we were there.\n\nI definitely won't go back and would not recommend to anyone.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Not good at all! First and last time I'll be eating at Red Ginseng. I live in North Vegas but my favorite sushi place is a ways away (Goyemon is the best!) When I eat sushi, I usually just eat nigiri, so the fish has to be fresh! The fish was mushy and meh. Seaweed salad tasted old and fishy not light and fresh with a hint of ocean flavor. The hot items like Teri chicken and chicken Katsu were blah. Teri chicken tasted like a rubber piece of chicken grilled on a George Foreman grill with a clumpy version of a teriyaki sauce. Veggie tempura was hard carrots, white potatoes and a single green bean. No onions, zucchini, sweet potato...the good stuff. The best thing was the pork gyoza and even that wasn't the greatest. Service was ok but there was only us and another family there. Overall it was just a bad experience. I had to force myself to eat what I ordered because of AYCE rules and this was literally one of the worst meals I've had in the 8 years I've been in Vegas.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	What makes this a 5 star all-you-can-eat sushi joint is the serving size of meat to rice is so perfectly abnormal to the carb overload of the competition. Quality is delectably fresh tasting. New sushi favorite!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Jesus Mary mother and Joseph! After my "City" (say it like the "City" sushi from South Park) I can't even think staright. So here's the story... My Girlfriend and I walked into this "city" establishment after I got a haircut from Sportclips, so I'm feeling fresh to say the least. Walked in, and I immediately had that thought everyone has when they walk Into a used car dealership, damn... I have just made a huge mistake... but there's no turning back now... Upon entering, were attacked by a little old Asian woman as if she was leading a Banzai charge in 1942. We were hurried to a far corner table when we were two of four people in the place. The woman promptly put menus on the table and took our drink order and disappeared for only what I can imagine was an immediate intense need to destroy the restroom with a Hiroshima sized deuce because she did not reappear for approximately 10 minutes with miso soup, no drinks. I ate the "city" soup, it was ok. At this point the other two patrons of "City" sushi departed with a look on their faces as if to say "I'm definitely going to regret this in about an hour..." after 15 minutes of only consuming soup and no drink, I made an executive decision to hunt down our "City" server so I could inquire about our drinks, and when I found her hiding behind the Japanese partition wall, I declared "I'm thirsty, may I have two waters please?" which she replied "oh yes very gooood." The hunt being concluded, she brought us water and took our order. The decor in "City" sushi is nuts... one wall is gold painted with foam caulking streaming down the wall with paintings screwed directly to the walls without a frame. The sushi was honestly one toe step above sams club sushi, which I gave 1 1/2 stars. I left with a single thought, "I'm going to regret that decision in about an hour."
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	The sushi here is great!! You can't beat the price for the amount of sushi. The staff is friendly and attentive, the fish was fresh, and there was a great variety of rolls on the menu. I have already recommended this restaurant to some of my family and they love the sushi here as well. I will be coming back here again for my next sushi craving : )
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	We came here tonight around 10pm and there was no one in the restaurant. I was a bit skeptical but at the urging of my fellow friend, we stayed.\n\nI don't dislike this place but its not my fav either. The decor and atmosphere, it sucks. \n\nThe food was good. The quality of fish was great. Huge portions. We got excellent service but we were the only ones in there (party of 3) so not sure how it would have been otherwise. We did AYCE and had about 12 rolls between all of us. The waitress, she was so sweet and even after we all couldn't breathe she was still trying to stuff us with more food. Lol. The only thing that stood out to me was the TNT roll and the jalapeño popper thingy jigs the chef surprised us with. Oh we tried the Japanese Lasagna, which is usually one of my favorites but theirs just tasted...off. No big deal though. \n \nI may or may not be back. Just not enough to steer me away from my fav sushi spot. Big thumbs up for the friendly staff though.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Like Cassandra H, My husband and I were also on our way to a different restaurant and discovered that this place was open.  We checked out the menu in the basket by the entrance and were immediately greeted by the waiter before we even opened the door.\n\nWe ordered 2 lunch specials of chicken teriayki. I had tempura veggies and my husband had tempura shrimp with his. We both had the miso soup.  My husband also ordered a spicy California roll (he's not a big sushi eater).\n\nThe California roll was pretty large but it had no flavor at all.  \n\nOur lunch portions were large but the chicken breast was not quality at all.  It was spongy and did not taste that great.  The soup was ok and the rice that came on the side was kind of mushy.  \n\nSome of their menu prices seemed high.\n\nOverall the food was OK.  I also did not enjoy being sick to my stomach a couple hours after eating here.\n\nMy husband and I will continue to travel to Lake Mead and Tenaya area to eat at Yummy Sushi on nights when we feel like eating sushi.  This was a huge disappointment as I had high hopes for this place since it is so close to our house.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	The lunch special is awesome! $13.00 for 2 rolls, soup, salad and 4 pieces. Not a thousand things to choose from but you can't beat $12.95!  The fish tasted fresh and the place was clean which is all good news for me! Good experience and will be coming back for sure
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Finally got to stop in on 1/30 after awaiting their opening.  Nice little place and the Korean options on the menu are a nice change of pace from the usual teriyaki options.  Still had the sushi, but looking forward to going back to try the bulgogi.  Plus this place seems like a quieter option than some of the other sushi places nearby.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	We ate here at the beginning of March.  The atmosphere is quiet and the location is large.  We ordered some Katsu chicken but it was not done.  The tempura udon was less than to be desired.  We did order two sushi rolls which were good.  I think there are better dining options in Centennial Hills if you are looking for sushi/Japanese food.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	The food was average, but the wait to get a table or service was not worth the wait. The all-you-can-eat is $27 for dinner, and they will charge extra if you leave any food behind. They we're out of beef and out of half of the sake on the menu. \n\nThis is a pass, go down the way to Sushi Loca for a better experience and food.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	My Wife and I decided to try this place a couple weeks ago.  What a big mistake on our part.  This place is terrible.  The older woman who waited on us was very unfriendly and gave me the impression that she did not want to be there waiting on customers.  My wife ordered a chicken entree and I ordered a pork dish.  Both arrived semi warm.  There seemed to be a party going on in the kitchen as the music was loud and not customer oriented.  The waitress, after serving our dinners, stood against the front wall and did not return to our table until we moitioned for a check.  Having eaten Japanese and Korean all over the world I would rate this place as bottom of the bottom.  I don't think this place will last long.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Great local sushi spot! Good specials like 9.99 all day two rolls hot or cold with miso soup. It's a small family owned place that seems to be slow paced. But the food has always been good!
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	Bland!!! The worst rolls I have ever had. No taste at all and the soft shell crab ... Eww what was that? A strip of flour! and .. didn't know edamame could be bad. Will not be back!! Terrible experience
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	The rolls were really good, they were ok doing half rolls which was nice, and sashimi orders were a good fish to rice ratio (nothing worse then a skinny piece of fish on a giant mound of rice). We've eaten at almost every ayce sushi place in Vegas and while this wasn't the best in the valley, it was really good and definitely the best on this side of town.
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	DON'T waste your time! We waited to be seated for 10 min, waited 10 min for a menu without even a hello or welcome, and another 10 min before we left without even our order being taken. A waste of 30 min to be ignored. Poor customer service. :(
-1vfRrlnNnNJ5boOVghMPA	This review is for their ramen, which is the only thing I tried. I was craving some ramen and still a little hungover from the night before, so I had pretty low standards for food at that point. I ordered some chicken ramen to go. The place was pretty dead when I went to go pick it up, but it still took about 30 minutes to make. The lady that I spoke with was really nice so that's the only reason they get 2 stars. \n\nAnyway I got home and started eating it. Absolutely horrible. I tasted the broth first and it was slimy and had an off flavor. It had the consistency of a canned chicken noodle soup broth. So I moved on to the noodles hoping I could just make my own broth and at least save the noodles. Nope. The noodles were so overcooked that it was basically just mush once it hit my mouth. I literally just took one bite and threw it away. It was even worse because I bought two of the ramens for me and my boyfriend and we both ended up throwing them out. So that was a waste of $20. Honestly if you want some ramen and they're the only thing nearby you're better off going to Smith's and buying some 30 cent Top Ramen. Very disappointing.
-1X2bBZAN1xfUxRXKPrxlQ	Brookstone is the Sharper Image's older and more laid back cousin.  Yea, it's got a similar feeling, but it's more focused on keeping you relaxed and healthy than on funky electronic toys.  The massaging chairs, pads and other devices are enough motivation to stop in alone.  And if you're with a partner who's less interested than shopping, it's a great place for them to just hang out too!  (Trust me - this works.)
-1X2bBZAN1xfUxRXKPrxlQ	I went in to look for a protector sleeve for my 17" laptop, but they only carry for Macbooks. Oh well, I won't get any support here. But, in all honesty, the guys that work there are as helpful as they can be. Very friendly. Stop in for a visit...especially if you're waiting for your sisters while shopping for shoes lol
-1X2bBZAN1xfUxRXKPrxlQ	Sharper Image is better, but when it's nowhere to be found, Brookstone will happily do.  This store is full of gadgets.  Some robotic, some high-tech and others that are just plain strange.  But at the very least, everything is still interesting to look at.\n\nPortable chair massagers that feel like tiny monkey hands are going up and down your back?  Check.\n\nAn exercise chair that you have to straddle like a horse? Check.\n\nAlarm clocks from the future?  Check.\n\nOh it's all there and you'll find it at PV mall.  You know that person on your Christmas list that's super hard to buy for?  You'll find their gift here for sure.
-1X2bBZAN1xfUxRXKPrxlQ	We have all been either dragged to the mall, or been the one who has dragged someone with them. Well if you find yourself being dragged to PV Mall make an escape to the Brookstone store if you can. \n\nThis store has everything you need to walk out feeling amazing. Massage chairs and tools of every kind, which are out and ready to be tested by you! I think the main idea of this store is items which will make you life more tolerable. Don't pay $ 2.00 for someone to massage you in the mall. Trust me just come here!
-20nZ6ztmBxGW4sOY7JPHA	How do I give this place negative stars?? \n\nNot sure how to choose what to negatively review first.  Between the awful service from the wannabe manager - Sergio -, the lack of warm water in the shower, or the clogged bathtub, or the dirty towels, dirty bed blankets, this place deserves to be avoided at all costs.  We had to learn the hard way why it was the only place with a vacancy during spring training, I hope no one else has to.  If you have a choice between sleeping in your car and staying here, stay in your car.
-20nZ6ztmBxGW4sOY7JPHA	Ok, I'm the kind of girl who grew up staying in motels, so I'm ok with your average Travelodge. This place is your BELOW average Travelodge... Reasons:\n\n1. Didn't ask if we were ok with a smoking room (yuck...hotels still allow this?)\n\n2. One bath towel, two guests... twice in the same week, with no apology\n\n3. Air conditioning sounds louder than a Harley Davidson\n\n4. Got back after a full day out (8+ hours) and the room wasn't cleaned\n\n5. Front desk didn't seem phased by this when I called to complain \n\nI will NOT be staying in a Travelodge again anytime soon. I highly recommend any other hotel than this one if you're planning on staying in Scottsdale.
-20nZ6ztmBxGW4sOY7JPHA	Place is pretty filthy. Yet I'm not here to enjoy the ambiance and decor. There was what appeared to be blood on the wall.
-20nZ6ztmBxGW4sOY7JPHA	The only reason I'm even leaving 1 star is because the lady at the front desk was very nice....\n\nThe hotel is disgusting & very out dated. We started in the elevator that looks VERY un stable like it could break at any second.... We get to the room and I immediately checked the bed for bugs, there was no bugs but all the sheets very stained I tried to get a few pictures. You couldn't walk on the floor without wearing socks because it was disgusting and had crap all over it. \n\nI'm not a picky person, I'll sleep anywhere but this place is horrible, the walls are so thin you can hear everyone & everything. \n\nWe immediately went down stairs to tell the front desk about our room and we didn't want a new room we just wanted our money back. She didn't even hesitate or want to see our room, that just tells me that it's not the first time their rooms have been completely disgusting.... Wouldn't recommend this to ANYONE. Spend a little more and stay away! It's a dump
-20nZ6ztmBxGW4sOY7JPHA	I went into Travelodge knowing that it wasn't going to be a 5 star hotel.\n\nHowever, it was dirtier than I could have imagined. Please don't stay here no matter how inexpensive it is. You do deserve better.\n\nThe only saving grace was the location and they didn't charge me for having my dog.\n\nThe bathroom area was dirty and the carpets were gross. They were ripped, torn, and covered in many different hair samples.\n\nI'm convinced there was a dead body rotting in one of the rooms, because the odors while walking to my room were foul and beyond ripe.\n\nThe bed was extremely uncomfortable, and the window blinds do a horrible job of blocking out the morning sun.
-20nZ6ztmBxGW4sOY7JPHA	Chiller System Alert. You either get A/C (and no heat) or you get Heat (no A/C). They have to be on one or the other. That's how the old "Chiller" systems worked. So in December, you will not have an A/C option and by April you will not have a heat option. I lived for 4 years in a Phoenix apartment complex with this. And since I stayed at this hotel in late January, I figured it out by the 2nd day. when the A/C came out "lukewarm" on a 75 degree day. I like to cool off after my hot shower so I can get dressed, do makeup, use the hot blow dryer, etc. It was OK, but I thought it was misleading for the staff not to come clean when we mentioned the A/C wasn't working a couple of times.  So, especially in Feb., March, Nov., Ask which they are presently on.    The price was great because they had just re-opened. I don't know what they charge or how they compare now.      That said, the Location is Great! You're right on the end of 5th Avenue with all these great Scottsdale-type shops/eating that you're there for. and when you want to go to the heart of "Old Town", there's a shuttle every 15 min. just 2 min. walking time away. You could walk to Old Town, but it's a hike. On a nice day, which is most, maybe you'll like it.         The pool was the most Heated pool I've ever been in! really Heated. in January. It was perfect for "winter". Some places say their outdoor pool is heated and it's still really too cold to go in. Not this one. and of course, ALL the pools are "heated" here in August!  actually, too warm because then you want to cool off, so most people go in at night instead.        There's a laundry room you can go to by elevator if you're on a long trip. ironing board.      Oh, one more thing: I wish they would cover up or put some kind of shade up over that window over the door. The room was bright as all get out early in the AM in spite of the adequate curtains on the big main window. Good thing I brought my night time eye mask.
-20nZ6ztmBxGW4sOY7JPHA	What a crappy hotel. If I had looked at the Yelp before staying there, I never would have. \n\n1. I believe they have a tape recorder where the "AC" unit is - each morning we would wake up and open the door to cooler eweather than was in our room. \n2. They have basically no employees. The front desk girl did almost everything, \n3. Its DIRTY. DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY. The pictures people posted are quite accurate \n\nI would never stay in this dump again - and they were more expensive than a far superior hotel less than two blocks away
-20nZ6ztmBxGW4sOY7JPHA	We checked in late..arrived around midnight. We were tired from a long drive here and we were ready for bed. The front door was locked and a small piece of paper was posted on the entrance door. The paper stated for customers to call a number for immediate assistance. I called and the front desk clerk walked up to open the door. He was barefoot and appeared half asleep. He checked us in. We went to our room and my first impression was not good at all. I noticed toenail clipings on the carpet and the decor was outdated. The smoke detector was hanging off the wall with no batteries. The room just did not look inviting at all. I did not even use the sheets or comcorter to cover myself during the night. I just wore a sweater and did not use a pillow. Its my fault. I get what i pay for. The price was cheap and so was the quality of the room. Pay the extra charge elsewhere and get a better night's rest. Sorry travelodge scottsdale..
-20nZ6ztmBxGW4sOY7JPHA	A lesson in booking through Hotwire... don't do it. I suppose that's the trouble with booking a hotel without knowing what it is before hand. First of all, the room ended up being more expensive through Hotwire than on their website and secondly the hotel was  terrible. At least the location was awesome (hence two stars instead of one). We were able to walk to a ton of great shops, restaurants and bars and there was a food truck meet up going on across the street from the hotel! I hadn't looked at the Yelp reviews of this Travelodge so I assumed it would be fine but as soon as we pulled into the parking lot we had a feeling we wouldn't be impressed. The hotel looked abandoned. Hardly anyone there, the grounds were dingy, no cars in the parking lot. The staff was unfriendly and had zero personality. The room was gross: stickers on the headboard of the bed, broken and stained ceiling tiles in the bathroom, dirty floor and bathtub, etc. The place was noisy all night long. There were really bright lights outside of the room that weren't blocked by the curtain. The heat didn't work in the room and I couldn't find any extra blankets to keep warm with. The breakfast was pretty unimpressive: cereal, unappetizing looking pre-packaged pastries, apples, juice, coffee and milk. They didn't even have water...? Weird.  I'm not really sure how this place is still in business. Having never stayed at a Travelodge before I'm curious if they are all this terrible or if we just lucked out picking the worst one they have for our first (and probably last stay). I'm glad we were only there for a few hours! Thanks a lot Hotwire ;)
-20nZ6ztmBxGW4sOY7JPHA	this hotel should be closed.  THE PICTURES BELOW ARE NOT ACCURATE.\nthe carpets are stained, the ceilings cracked and stained, cigarette burns \nin bathroom,  no railing on bath tub to hold on to, chairs dirty, things on the floor, you could not and would not want to walk around barefoot at all, VENDING machines snacks were stale, the bed was bad i was in pain and still am, dogs are allowed in rooms, so you do not know what the stains were, also, feces outside and smells, there were bugs constantly coming in to the room, hotel has nothing to keep bugs away.\n\nHOTEL SHOULD BE TORN DOWN AND CONDEMED.
-20nZ6ztmBxGW4sOY7JPHA	This is a great hotel if you're looking to stash a dead body. But, if you want a clean room that doesn't wreak like a 49 year old ashtray then go elsewhere.
-20P7Av7rbvx1DEb9k7PjQ	The absolute worst. The place is never open, or is always having heating or electrical problems. Now it seems to be closed for good. When calling about things on consignment, you get a message that mailbox is full. Not sure if I will ever get my furniture back!
-20P7Av7rbvx1DEb9k7PjQ	Great place to shop if you're looking for that unique gift for someone who has everything. Karen was very helpful and I will be returning.
-20P7Av7rbvx1DEb9k7PjQ	What a find... I love shopping with Karen.  Always new merchandise and in great condition.  I love the little accent pieces and fun accessories she has as well.  She is always trying to find that "special piece" for her regulars.  Stop in and see Karen and tell her what you are looking fro. This is a great secret in Wexford!
-20P7Av7rbvx1DEb9k7PjQ	Be very careful dealing with this store.  We found out the hard way how she can sell so cheap.  We consigned her a complete dining room set last March which she sold in June or July.  In is now December and we have still not been paid.  We try to call but she will not call back.  She seemed so nice when we first met, but once she owes you money, it's like you are dealing with a completely different person.
-20P7Av7rbvx1DEb9k7PjQ	Got a nice table and chairs here just before the holidays - just in time to receive visitors!   We are still enjoying the furniture.  Reasonable price and great people here.
-20P7Av7rbvx1DEb9k7PjQ	If you are shopping for used furniture this business is a great place.  If you are consigning furniture go elsewhere.  The business is very disorganized and not able to accurately track your merchandise or sales.  The payments are erratic, undocumented and as I found out incorrect.  When you ask for clarification your questions are met with a rude and dismissive  attitude.  There are a lot of great consignment stores, unfortunately Yours to Mine is not one of them.
-20P7Av7rbvx1DEb9k7PjQ	Consigning here was a big mistake! Initially, the owner, Karen was helpful, but when it came time to find what my things had sold for she said the contract had been terminated. This was after she was closed for vacation and electrical problems. She never returned phone calls or emails, and when confronted she claimed to have sent me a check, which I never received. Funny thing, as I was leaving (totally dissatisfied) I found one of my items still for sale. I took 17 items and received nothing for any.
-20P7Av7rbvx1DEb9k7PjQ	You will be charmed by the variety of furniture and home decor. There are so any great pieces of fine quality and brand name furniture and accessories. My experience has exceeded my expectations. Yours to Mine will be one of your favorite places to shop. They are very fair and professional. Shop with confidence and the prices are great too!
-20PsGUoi0cK3hKwtFoh2w	They should tell you the show times before hand, made it through the exhibit and missed the movie start by a couple minutes and they wouldn't let us in. Only a couple items worth seeing, hardly worth the 25 entrance fee. Save your time and money.
-20PsGUoi0cK3hKwtFoh2w	If I could give this show 10 stars, I would. I can't begin to explain the meticulousness to detail that has been put forth to every single aspect of the performance, from the costumes to the musical instruments to every move, facial expression, and gesture on the part of every single performer in this show! There was not one instance of overblown mimicry; the show was not a "tribute" to Elvis. It really WAS Elvis: the feel, the atmosphere, the excitement. I actually got goosebumps!  If you're an Elvis fan (or just wonder why he was so legendary, if you're too young to remember), you just HAVE to see this show; it's breathtaking!
-20PsGUoi0cK3hKwtFoh2w	I thought the exhibit was very good and well worth the money. The film was a bit of a let down. It was just a bunch of concert clips with no historical perspective. I would of preferred a short doc or some narration or graphics connecting the clips.
-20PsGUoi0cK3hKwtFoh2w	Ah Vegas, such a great place to visit.  There's the tawdry shows, gambling, etc.  However, when in Vegas with a family and/or a group of mixed ages, it is really nice to have somewhere to go that EVERYONE can fully enjoy.  \n\n"Elvis: The Exhibition" IS THAT PLACE!!!  \nOn my last visit to Vegas, I was with a friend in her 50s and my niece in her tweens (I'm in my 30s).  We decided to check out the museum at the Westgate Hotel since we had read an article about it.  Elvis used to stay at the hotel and perform there - way back when it was the Las Vegas Hilton.  In fact, from 1969-1976 he broke all sorts of attendance records there with his sold-out performances.  You can read more about it on Wikipedia at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westgate_Las_Vegas_Resort_%26_Casino.  What better venue then for an Elvis museum (outside of Graceland)?!?!  \n\nThe museum did not disappoint.  It was great.  The music and movies playing in each section really got us in a great mood.  Looking at the memorabilia, pictures, costumes, vehicles, etc. was awesome.  It brought my friend down memory lane.  For me, it reminded me of all the things I had seen on TV even after Elvis was already long gone (he died just a few months after I was born).  For my niece, it gave her a reference to a man she has heard about, but never really had much direct experience with.  By the end of our time at the museum, she was a fan as well!!!  \n\nThe main movie that is shown about Elvis is well worth watching from beginning-to-end, so my advice would be to find out when it starts, and time your trip at the museum accordingly.  The movie part is at the end of the museum, right before you get to the gift shop.  So if you get there and the movie will start soon, I recommend going to see the movie first, and then back-tracking to see the rest of the museum.  Or even better, if you can time it right, you can stroll through the museum in about 40-60 minutes (depending on your love of all things Elvis), and get to the movie when it starts.\n\nI think the museum will make a fan out of anyone!  \n\nActually, I think that the museum, along with other aspects of the Westgate such as its placement on the monorail, restaurants such as Benihana, sportsbook, new renovations all over including the pool area, and unbeatable prices - make it a fabulous just off the craziness of the strip place to stay!  I think I understand why Elvis lived there in the penthouse for so long!  It's nice to have him back in the building!!!
-2A9emZwBK8zYHPnAmM0hw	Wow! This place has turned a corner. Under new management  The food is outstanding and fresh, the price is right. You must check it out.  No tricks to force the food taste better, the staff is friendly, helpful. Try the Moo Goo Gai Pan, it is outstanding. And their Beef w/Broccoli where the beef is well cooked and seasoned not rubbery and the Broccoli is cooked and crunchy.  New modern furniture and a flat screen tv. We'll be back, for sure.
-2A9emZwBK8zYHPnAmM0hw	Another one of those cheap Chinese buffets (5.95) that puts out a few tasty dishes that get you up to 3 stars.The decor sucks and the washrooms need to be torn out and rebuilt. On the brighter side I found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. I would return to this place because of the food, cheap price and the friendly staff , and to see if they remodeled it.
-2A9emZwBK8zYHPnAmM0hw	This place has definitely changed for the better! I had visited here a while back and remember the food as being mediocre and the decor was just horrible and cheap. Today I called for take out for the first time in quite a while. When I walked in I was shocked, there's a new name and the whole restaurant has been completely redone! It looks wonderful! The staff is very friendly, they kept thanking me for calling and telling me they hope that I would enjoy the food. When he told me my total for two lunch specials, and egg drop soup, and some fried wontons, I was shocked! Only $12?!  With this in mind, I was still expecting the same mediocre food....it was WONDERFUL! The egg rolls were nice and crispy, the sweet and sour sauce tasted great, and most of all the chicken lo mein was to die for. It had plenty of vegetables in it and even water crescents which I feel like are left out of a lot of dishes these days! I was really impressed by the service and the food. I'll definitely not take so long to come back this time around.  The new management has helped this place quite a bit. I've tried just about every Chinese place in Tempe and this is definitely my winner.
-2A9emZwBK8zYHPnAmM0hw	Just your average Chinese buffet, maybe a little small.  There were the basics that you'll find just about anywhere - everything was just about the same.\n\nNothing really jumped out, but things were decent enough that I'd probably go back. One thing that does work in its favor - it's a couple dollars cheaper than a lot of buffets out there.
-2A9emZwBK8zYHPnAmM0hw	Got yelled at by the delivery guy for not putting my apartment number on my online order. My computer auto-filled my address, so it is my fault not for double checking, but he called to get the unit number. On the phone he gave me a bunch of attitude, then he gets here and reads me the riot act again.  \n\nFood: B-. Prices: C+. Customer service: F
-2A9emZwBK8zYHPnAmM0hw	The food and customer service were literally worse than I have ever experienced in my entire life! \n\nI went for dinner around 4:30pm on a Saturday. Nearly all of the trays on the buffet were empty. What was left was cold, but I didn't know that until it was on my plate. When I got back to my table I had a bite of orange chicken, which was stone cold. The white rice was hard and cold. I pushed my plate to the side while I debated what to do. One of the waitresses came over and asked if I'd like a drink refill, even though I had only drunk about a third of the glass of soda. I declined and explained that my guest and I were going to be leaving because the food was horrible, but it would be great if we could get a refund. Laney came over and said she'd refund half, but later agreed to refund me for both my meal and my guest's meal, which was as cold and stale as mine. When she came back, Laney presented me with a new receipt for $4, citing that there was nothing wrong with the sodas we ordered. While that was true, I explained I believed that was horribly petty since my guest had drunk none of his soda and I had so little of mine -- and the point of the drinks were to enjoy them with our meals. The man, whom I assume to be Laney's brother, came over and was very apologetic, refunded all of my money and offered to cook us fresh food  free of charge to learn how good his fresh cooking was (We declined.), but he didn't seem to think there was a problem with having cold and stale food on the buffet line. \n\nLong story short, I think that China Farm uses quality ingredients and may very well produce good food when cooked to order, but don't count on getting an edible meal at the buffet. The orange chicken was all white meat and the beef and broccoli my guest had was made with quality looking beef and vegetables ... just cold.
-2A9emZwBK8zYHPnAmM0hw	I've been eating at this joint for 20+ years.  There are better Chinese restaurants in town but  they do a lot of things good enough to stay on my list of regular places to visit.  CF is your typical small Chinese Buffet hole in the wall.  This food is above average and worth a visit for a quick lunch if you are in the neighborhood or passing through the area. Several things that I think the do GREAT are the Kung Pao Chicken, Wings and Smoked Fish (Fridays only).  Their Kung Pao is the best I've ever had hands down bar none !  The flavor in their recipe is just perfect.  Also they have great wings.  They are not the typical "hot wings' just breaded and fried chicken wings.  Their coating on the wings is so good you could open and chicken joint just on that recipe alone.  Think KFC crunchy but with the flavor of original KFC and you'll come close to what their wings taste like.  And last but not least...smoked fish on Fridays.  I have to admit at first 20 years ago it was not something I cared for but for the last 10 years it has grown on me and now I get a craving for their fish at least once a month and have to visit them on Fridays.
-2A9emZwBK8zYHPnAmM0hw	The fried chicken wings are good.  The rest?  Below par Chinese MSG.  I might get some wings sometime, but the rest of the food is below mediocre.
-2A9emZwBK8zYHPnAmM0hw	Don't waste your time... Ick! It's already dry enough in Arizona, don't think we need our food like that too...
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	Every experience at Burrito Burrito has been fab!  \nFood is always fresh and never a long wait.  It's faster than getting a sub sandwich made and more tasty!
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	Stopped by for a quick bite on my way to the TFC game.\n\nGot a regular chicken burrito with all the toppings on a whole wheat shell.\n\nTotal came to just under $9.  They prepare their burritos similar to how it's done at burrito.  Toppings are all piled on and it goes on the flat top for a toasting before serving.\n\nFirst bite was nice because I got the chilling affect of the cold iceberg lettuce.  The rest was kind of disappointing.  Way too much refried beans. The rice tasted a little dry.  The texture of the chicken was a little off, it tasted almost like ground chicken, or chicken that are way too shredded.  I would like to blame that on me going towards the end of business so I might getting the bottom end of the rice & chicken.  Nothing particularly outstanding about the salsa, guac or hot sauce.\n\nThe service was nice. It wasn't anything crazy given that it was a quick service restaurant.  They have a couple of tables with chairs where you can sit and eat your burrito inside, and there are also a few tables outside in the alley of the Liberty Street Market where you can sit and enjoy your food.\n\nOne thing I did notice is they also serve fries, and they have different levels.  Plain to cheesy to supreme (salsa) and extreme (steak & salsa).  Range from I believe ~$3-4  to just under $8 for the extreme.  I would like to go back and give them a try on the fries.
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	Compared  to Fat Bastard, this place was not tasty  at all. A for  effort but they can't  compare. Owner  was a bit  too confident and they  ran out of GUACAMOLE. How does that  happen at a Mexican  restaurant?! I went because  I  had a Groupon. Will not  be  going back.
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	I was excited for a new burrito place in liberty village but it was not what I was looking for. I ordered the chicken burrito. It is a pretty simple order but I have had way better. The worst part for me was the ground chicken. If you are going to do a chicken burrito at least some chopped grilled chicken or pulled chicken. The ground chicken did not taste fantastic and when you get those chewy parts in chicken it really turns me off.\n\n I am going to have to say I am not going to try again. There are other places in the area for similar price and better taste!
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	I'm not keen on burritos myself but I had the nachos, they tasted like the bag had been open on the counter for a couple days, I should likely have complained but unfortunately I can be a bit of a wuss.  My husband had a burrito and I think he was just bitter we hadn't gone to fat bastard instead.
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	This place is a complete joke. I went on three separate occasions and the place has been closed with no sign on the door or explanation. I went on a Saturday at 5:30 and they were closed when they claimed to be open until 3 am. I am not sure what kind of business they are running, but they are very unprofessional. For those in the area, just avoid this place and go to Big Fat Burrito. If they are not serious about being a business, I am not going to give them my money or recommend them. This place is a total avoid at all costs.
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	I don't understand how this place doesn't have more reviews OR more good reviews for that matter. Had a late lunch here yesterday with a good buddy, and while I admit that it was a tad difficult to find as it was in the Liberty Village Market area (which I might add is a friggin sweet space for independent businesses), this hidden little taste of tex mex was a great find and I was thrilled to be introduced to it. \n\nA pretty standard take away burrito spot in terms of its set up, however they offer some creative options that I have yet to come across in other similar spots. While they offer the standard burrito options, they also have tacos, burrito bowls and other items as well. \n\nWhat really struck me was the difference in size between the standard burrito and the "double" being hungry but not wanting to kill myself I decided to opt for the standard measuring in at about 6 inches in length BUT don't be turned off, it likely was about 8+ inches around as asking for "the works" gives you a very full burrito. I ordered the surf and turf burrito (something I had not had before - steak and shrimp) and it was excellent!\n\nBeing the wannabe budding burrito expert I think what made this place a winner for me was the generous helpings of toppings but not having them overindulge with rice. Far too many times asking for rice in your burrito means a carb overload and certain feelings of being stuffed. I found the put a perfect amount of rice in and filled the rest of the space with more flavourful ingredients. Their Habanero hot sauce is fantastic and is a familiar flavour....I believe I've had it before somewhere else, but it's a fav of mine.\n\nOnly negative's for me were -0.5 for being out of Guacamole and minus -0.5 for not putting enough sauce in it upon ordering. Other than that the ingredients were fresh and cooked well and the steak and shrimp were a welcome new experience for me. \n\nI was comfortable after finishing the standard and I feel the DOUBLE would have been a terrible mistake ha ha. \n\nIll be back when in liberty village. ALSO, prices I'd say are slightly above average for burritos but not astronomically out of this world. Give them a shot!\n\n14/30
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	I've tried coming here on 2 separate occasions on a weekday after work around 6-6:30pm and both times it's been closed. There's not even a store hours sign on the door or window. So sketch.
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	Absolutely the worst soft tacos we have ever had! Taco bell is higher quality. We were drawn in by the crowd, but turns out they were in there because of the cold :( Sorry to be harsh...
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	I visit Liberty Village often and was delighted to see that this spot was opening up a few months back. Having been on a Burrito craving spree I quickly looked up their and thought hey these guys might not be so bad. I have tried several Burrito spots in the Queen West / Liberty Area yet I still find myself running towards College Street to get my Burrito Boyz fix. \n\nOne Saturday afternoon me and my sister decided to drop on by at 12pm noon only to notice they were closed. We found this odd and double checked their hours and even called just to make sure they were probably opening late but NOPE. No sign on their door and no notice they just weren't open. This was the start of disappointment. \n\nThe following weekend we figured why not give this place a shot again since we were dying to see what it was all about. When we arrived we checked out their menu and decided to go with the safe bet of getting a chicken burrito. Wow....this place disappointed us big time. Not only was it more expensive than Burrito Boyz..the quality just lacked drastically. Their rice is made a lot differently and almost tasted like day old Portuguese Style rice that has been sitting in the fridge for far too long. The chicken was very chewy and had this awful amount of spice too it as if the spice top fell off the container as they were seasoning the meat. Burrito Burrito unfortunately was very disappointing and kept me away for a very long time. \n\nLike a bad relationship..I should have seen the red flags once they didn't pick up the phone.
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	After Fat Bastard Burrito in Liberty Village became a disappointment I needed a new burrito spot close by. A friend recommended I try this place and I must say it's pretty good. So far I've tried their large chicken burrito (do not attempt unless you are ready to sleep for a couple hours after), steak burrito and a couple of their burrito bowl options. They've all been pretty good. Ingredients are fresh and they're not tight with the guacamole like Fat Bastard is. Id give it a 3.5 star but that's not an option here so I give it a four simply because their large burrito is the size of a bottle of wine.
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	This place is terrible. Terrible service, no hot sauce in a burrito place! They ran out and didn't bother to go to the metro and get some more. You can't see them making your burrito. The staff are unknowledgable about the products they are making. Terrible. Don't eat here
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	Had the surf and turf burrito bowl today. Although the shrimp had a lovely batter and was delicious, there just wasn't enough. Also, there was very little steak in the bowl. They layered a lot of the beans and next to no cheese underneath it. For a cheese fan, I was disappointed. For almost $10 I've had a better bowl with more meat and more cheese. \n\nAs for the service, they certainly were lovely folks so that alone might be worth trying them again but definitely not the bowl. I imagine the soft tacos will have just the right amount of meat, right? Here's for hoping.
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	it's average for a burrito place, I mean how hard is it to shove food into a wrap and close it.  The burrito bowls are my fave, but they have been getting smaller and less consistent. \n\nThe owner is super sweet, and is trying to keep business flowing, as other shops around there have been sinking - and fast!  But the service is slow, grumpy and if you order the nachos, they are sometimes put into a cold fryer so they just suck up the oil and never crisp up.
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	I ordered a Steak + Chicken mixed with hot sauce and extra jalapenos. Instead I got a wrap filled with lettuce, beans, & rice doused in Frank's Red Hot (which, for the record, is more salty than it is hot). To be fair, a couple of pieces of chicken & shreds of steak found their way into the burrito. Compared to the superb burritos at Fat Bastard's a 5 minute walk away, these are really overpriced bags of bean paste and rice.
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	I had the pleasure to frequent this establishment on several occasions. In my opinion the food tastes fantastic, it's reasonably priced and the portions are enormous!   My personal favorite is the chicken quesadillas. The staff and especially the owner are extremely friendly and courteous. I'd be weary of adding too much hot sauce to the mix.    I would highly recommend this fine establishment to anyone.  Great Work!
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	Very good and friendly ordering service from the man in charge.  They did my halibut well done, extra crispy - much appreciated!\n\nThe halibut burrito was VERY good!  Best in the neighbourhood.  I also got a chicken taco (yes, I know -  gluttonous).  It was quite tasty with the nacho cheese! \n\nNot cheap, but welcome to Liberty.
-2EAyppKR_2xuLyvJZEbRQ	This place is laughable.\n\nWaited 20 minutes for a mediocre, cold burrito. No napkins to be found.\n\nThey really don't appear to know what they're doing.
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	Great cocktails, great food.  \n\nThe first time i went in they spent too much time explaining the food, but theyve calmed down and the food speaks for itself now.  it can be pricey, but it's definitely a fun adventure in flavour. \n\nOne small thing, i hate the lights over the kitchen and the way they bleed fluorescent light into  the dining room.  i suspect it's why the bar at the front is such a popular place to eat!
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	This place has great service but unfortunately the food misses the mark.  They are going for high end cuisine with a high end price, but the flavours really did not add up.  The ingredients were fresh and hyper local, often coming straight from their roof, which I thought was lovely.  However, something about the flavours in my dishes did not really seem like they went together very well.  It seemed more like "lets mix really random stuff and call it high end".\nSome of the food we ate:\n1.  I had the silken tofu and the flavours on that were very odd, some bites were bland and other very salty.\n2.  Black noodles with radish cake.  That was actually really good.\n3.  Vegetarian carpaccio.  This was ok.\n4.  Cornish hen.  This was pretty good, but also on the salty side.\n5.  The lobster.  This was really good and my favourite of the evening.\n6.  The chocolate caramel dessert.  Now this sounded amazing, but the cake was a bit dry.  The icecream was mostly melted by the time it go to me and the mousse was not sweet.  \n7.  Rhubarb dessert.  This was ok but very very tart.\n\nOverall if we are paying over $200 for a meal I want more then 2 of the dishes we try to wow me.  However, I will say again I did appreciate the service and local ingredients.
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	This is the longest amount of time that I've ever waited for the least amount of food ever! Our three course 'summary' meal took three hours to complete. That's the amount of time over which I expect a 10- course Chinese wedding banquet. On top of that, it took a long time for us to initially get water or to get our waiter's attention to put our order in. \n\nThe food, when it did arrive, were visual works of art. They were beautifully presented, the kitchen using the white plates as white canvases for their gorgeous food paintings. The flip side is, of course, that the generous white space of the large plates and bowls made the food look even more miniscule. Depending on what you end up ordering, what you end up could be more or less substantial than you would have imagined.\n\nI had the yellowtail sashimi app. It was deliciously tender. For the main, I had the trout which was perfectly pan fried to a beautiful crisp on the one side and wonderfully tender on the other. The dessert was a strange assortment of a purple yam yogurt and crunchy stuff. It looked pretty but the combination of savory and sweet really didn't work so well for me. I also got to try my friend's soft shell crab. So juicy!
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	great service, great food and amazing presentation! We went back 2 weeks after the first time because we loved it so much. \n\nThe only complaint is that they can't do any substitutions. (I asked for them to not give me one item listed and they couldn't do it)
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	Great from beginning to end. Upon arrival they were busy seating other patrons so the bartender ran over and got us seated. The waiter was over quickly to offer water and discuss cocktails.  The two we ordered were very creative and tasty. I would have ordered another but I was driving. Remind me to cab it next time. \nApps came and were both fantastic although I wasn't expecting the crickets and meal worms?! Crunchy!!  Mains were equally brilliant.  I had rainbow trout.  Gf had lamb. Desert topped it off.  All courses were not only fantastic flavours but artfully presented. Portions were perfect but we are quality over quantity people. If you like "all you can eat" buffets, this is not the place for you!  Knowledgable and concientious wait staff.  We picked the 55.00 three course option which turned out to be well worth the $. You can tell that a lot of time and effort is put into the menu which changes frequently. Quality of ingredients is as good as it gets. Bravo
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	I've been twice.  The first time was 5 star worthy, the second time 3 star worthy -- so they end up with four.\n\nGreat food.  The first time, the bartender made me a mojito and it was AMAZING.  The second time, they had no mint (just chocolate mint?) in stock, so I ordered a drink off their cocktail list and it wasn't very good.  Boozy, but not a pleasant taste.  \n\nThe buffalo carpaccio was the best, and the lamb dish was outstanding.  The first time I went, the service was impeccable - friendly, informative, very good.  The second time, the waitress was surly, inattentive and (although my date was being a super prick to her) very condescending to my guest.  We ordered the shrimp appetizer and she told us that the head of shrimp comes on the plate and, although dead, might still be moving.  I have no problems with this but my date was grossed out and said, "Oh, we don't want it then," and she proceeded to mock him and roll her eyes and basically make him look like an idiot.  Not cool.  Even though he is an idiot.
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	I was somewhat disappointed with URSA. First of all, the menu descriptions have very little correlation with the actual dishes. I don't think it is helpful to call a dish by a minor ingredient or to use the word "salad" when the dish comes on a board and is separated into distinct groupings of vegetables. Bottom line, when I'm paying $20 for an appetizer, I want to know what I'm getting. Secondly, there are some pretty advanced and complicated ingredient lists for each dish and of the 5 dishes we tried, I don't think any of them gelled 100%. The best was an 80% and the worst a 60%. If you're going to try to put 8 ingredients together, you better be more confident in how they actually work. I think there was a certain arrogance that diners wouldn't know any better and would be impressed by the rarity or audacity of the ingredients. \n\nOn the plus side, all the food was fresh and healthy, generally well cooked and presented. I just didn't feel fulfilled at the end of the meal, nor did I feel that it was good value.
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	There is something to be said for a restaurant that makes every attempt to reclaim food. It can be great or it can suck. \n\nURSA is a delight to your tastebuds. The menu is always changing so you may not eat what I had. I literally ordered every dish on the menu and loved it all. Give it a try, and impress someone special. \n\nThank you for a great memory and meal
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	I'm getting really tired of these hyped up hipster joints on Queen West serving tiny portions and overpriced food. Eating out in Toronto is becoming an exercise of dropping 2 bills, and being instantly forgettable the minute you leave except the feeling of being ripped off afterwards. I will say Ursa's presentation of dishes is beautiful but the lamb was 2 bites and the rest of the plate was a bunch of meh root veggies which probably cost 20 cents to source. The whitefish  was overcooked though the sides (more root veggies) were better in this dish. The single potato fingerling (4 cm long) was tasty. The worst was this weird chocolate hazelnut concoction sitting in a watery liquid emulsion. Lucky the spoons were the tiniest I've ever seen because it was done in 2 scoops.  Oh BTW bread costs extra. This place is too precious for its own good and it floors me how the rating averages 4 stars. You will have to another meal right after spending $180 for 2 here because you'll be starving otherwise.
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	Ursa is a distinctive experience.  It's not like other restaurants where the point is to chose some attractive items from the menu, enjoy them, and socialize with your friends (though of course you could, in fact , do just that. but you might miss the point).  The Sharkey brothers, one front of house, the other in the kitchen, have something very cerebral going on:  it's a food project and they want you to join with them in pushing some boundaries.  For instance:  both times I have dined there the house made tofu starter has been pretty far out there, the first time macha tofu, the second time served with extraordinary sauces and condiments. The first time silky as could be, almost a dessert in texture; the second time nice and firm.  Or take the crickets -- that's right crickets, the insects.  They are dried and ground into flour, which went into the cavatelli in last night's pheasant consomme.  High protein.  Part of a project that might alleviate hunger and malnutrition in some parts of the world.  If you have the chance to talk to Lucas Sharkey about this, you will realize that the brothers are driven and are very focused in ways that will surprise you.    Another example:  both meals I've enjoyed at Ursa have ended with the (again house-made) probiotic burrata. Done differently each time, but done very very well.  Last night with smoked apple jam.  I hasten to add at this point that the other standout sweet last night was a spectacular combination of chocolates and dolce de leche.  Mains are a bit more traditional, but there are some interesting deconstructive themes that run through the ever-changing short menu.  A month ago, there was a pig five ways (or was it four?), small bits of different cuts with interesting sauces/condiments and arrangements. Lat night a very nice guinea fowl with the extremely moist white meat also in a boudin blanc, as well as perfectly poached Atlantic lobster (claw) with a kaffir lime broth, and another member of our party had lamb cooked sous vide (thirty hours!), yet with the top still beautifully crisped, the flesh almost like butter in its tenderness.  There are some misses, but this is food that demands your attention and your thought.  The wine list is spectacular and modestly priced (Lodi Balzon Pinot Noir, maybe the best California Pinot I've ever had for a tad over sixty bucks).  Bottom line for me:  these guys are doing something that no one else is attempting.  If you are serious about food, check them out.  They deserve your support.
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	I could not have asked for a better place to celebrate my birthday!  URSA is 1 of... 600 bookmarks of mine on Yelp and now I can cross it off the list.\n\nThey have a healthy list of cocktails, spirits and beers.  My girlfriend Andrea (love you!) just kept piling on those cocktails.  I don't think there was one I didn't like!\n\nFor my appetizer I opted for the Cornucopia that was their Burrata Salad.  I call it a Cornucopia because of the colourful plate that was placed before me.  It contained orange hues (grilled apricots, squash blossoms), greens (garlic scape + foraged leaves), red (currants), white (currants).  While it was visually appealing, it was also tummy-satisfying!  Who wants a boring old Caesar?  \n\nFor my main I opted for the lamb and also tasted some of the bison.  (If you're my friend, a prerequisite is that you have to share your food, haha).  Both were extremely tender and cooked to a perfect pink.  The lamb came with a side of charred eggplant, bulgur, spring pea, yoghurt and harrissa.  The bison was accompanied with a rye berry puree which resembled texturally, gruel, asaparagus, Bearnaise and water plants in an "Old Fashioned" jus. \n\nBut my most favourite part of the meal had to have been dessert.  I felt like I was in the middle of a science experiment while feasting on the Milk + Ricotta (meant for 2 people).  There were tiny vials of milk that were lukewarm (the server states this should be consumed within a 15 minute time frame before the whey separates and it's not as palatable), grilled apricots, diced pear, and housemade ricotta with raw honey.  Creative presentation, and definitely an adventure for my friends!\n\nBut the dessert that knocked my socks off was the Yuzu Lemon Curd (which in essence was a deconstructed lemon meringue pie) - BUT - the "crust" was a duck fat sable.  DUCK FAT!  I KNEW I picked this restaurant for a good reason.  The sable was absolutely delicious and the lemon curd was as fresh as linen!  The meringue was so divine I wanted to lick the plate.\n\nAll in all, for our party of 5, the bill came to just shy of $300, but it was worth EVERY penny!  \n\nFrom the service (thank you for the complimentary birthday dessert) to the food - there wasn't one thing I didn't like.\n\nNow I'm kind of wishing every weekend were my birthday!  Definitely go if you haven't been!
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	...Cocktail list was extensive and creative.  We went for a Hopewell (Bourbon, House Vanilla Brandy, Crab Apple Shrub) and the not-on-the-menu Giftbox (Gin, Egg White, Rosewater Syrup, Cucumber).  The former was heavy hitting but gorgeously aromatic, while the latter (my servers great suggestion) was tart, but refreshingly smooth with just enough floral sweetness.\n\nThe menu was sophisticated, yet inviting. There was a generous spread of different protein and accompaniment offerings, without any duplications of flavours. I really appreciate how challenging this must be, particularly for a menu that changes often.  I had read that the portions at Ursa were small for the price, and I can't say I disagree. However, keeping with Ursa's theme of celebrating the inherent healthful qualities of good quality ingredients, I felt it was appropriate. The two of us left satisfied, but certainly not "full" or uncomfortable, ideal for going out afterwards to continue a night of fun. This is what we had:\n\n Raw Bread with House made Cultured Butter- This was a light and delicious starter, my only complaint was that it was maybe a bit too dainty (aka. I wanted more). We received a few lovely beet and sumac crackers, and a few fennel peanut ones, served with two selections of deliciously luscious butter (sea salt and roasted garlic).  The star for me was the beet, which had a mild sweet and deep spice flavour, and paired beautifully with the sea salt butter.\n\nHouse made Tofu- Radish Bonito, Nori, Seedlings, Dashi- I was skeptical of this at first, but it turned out to be the winner of the two first courses. The tofu was moist, creamy and sumptuous, which was a perfect accompaniment to the crispy fried radish cakes.  What really tied everything together was the flawless dashi broth, which had a defined umami flavour, and a perfect level of salt.\n\nDuck Egg- Sunchoke, Nigella, Bitter Greens, Sauce Gribiche- Unlike the tofu, which was perfectly seasoned, we both found this one a bit bland, surprising for all of the fatty elements on the plate. I also found everything to be luke warm, perhaps as a result of careful (and beautiful) plating and the dish sitting too long.  The wait may also have something to do with the fact that my duck egg yolk was not nearly as runny as I had hoped, so my beautiful brioche toasts didn't have much purpose. Having said that, from a texture and flavour perspective (aside from the seasoning situation), this was very well balanced. The sunchoke hash, speckled with spicy bitter nigella seed, was a beautiful accompaniment, and the gribiche (a mayo-like sauce usually with pickles, tarragon and capers) brought a bit of relief from the bitter dandelion greens.\n\nWild Boar- Toasted Barley, Turnip, Kohlrabi, Quince Mostarda, Huckleberry- This was the star dish of the day.  The boar was moist, flavourful, and perfectly seasoned, and it's richness was balanced out beautifully by the tangy sweet mostarda condiment. The barley was cooked perfectly, and had a deep nuttiness that was lovely with the mildly sulfurous flavour of the turnip and kohlrabi. What was truly impressive, however, was the huckleberry leather, which lent a satisfying chew that melted delicately on the tongue. Stunning composition.\n\nGeorgian Bay Whitefish- Sea Urchin, Black Truffle, Pickle Juniper Berry, Rapini- Another really solid dish. The whitefish was perfectly cooked, with a moist flesh and a wickedly crispy crust. The sea urchin sauce was rich, but refreshing, and the black truffle lent a delicate level of umami aromatics. While I loved the idea of a pickled juniper berry, biting into it really overwhelmed my palate so that it was all I could taste.  This would probably work much better for a heartier red meat dish than a dainty whitefish.\n\nDate & Carob Cake, Scotch, CO2 Apple, Quince, Clove- A very interesting dessert, with both sweet and savoury elements. The cakes were dense and hearty, and took on a smoky flavour from the scotch.  The apple and quince had been compressed to a texture similar to a thick fruit leather, but without the sticky sweetness.  I really liked the concept, and all of the elements, I just wish there was a bit more sweetness and something creamy to balance everything out.\n\nFresh Mozzarella Curd, Lemon Pudding, Lemon Confit, Gaspe Honey- Another beautiful presentation, and a delicious light end to a good meal. The curd had a satisfying chew, similar to cottage cheese curds, but with more fat.  This was a perfect carrier for the tangy sweet lemon pudding and confit.....
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	I can't say that I didn't like it here. \n\nThe vibe of the place is surprisingly chill for Queen West. \n\nI mean sure, they have the hipster audacity to overexplain to you the origins of all the ingredients of the stuff you're eating.\n\nYou learn about the field that the mushrooms are foraged from.\n\nYou learn about the random shit that they infuse into perfectly good alcohol to make it more perfect.   Cedar.  Organic something-or-other.  Titatinum.  Adamantium.   \n\nYou learn the name and genetic lineage of the cow that's died for your sins.  \n\nItems are plated in an artistic yet edible manner. \n\nIt's relatively expensive for what it actually is, but worth it once.  Perhaps twice. \n\nOne of the better restaurants in this part of town.
-2hOglg7Lh8ZgclQJ9ba2w	I see food in a different light after having eaten at Ursa.   If you are a foodie, you would love this place.    I can tell you that the Chef put a lot of thought into designing each dish.  Every course came out like a piece of art.   Just beautiful.   So, Ursa teaches you how to look and appreciate each foods that you don't normally see in the supermarkets and bring them to life.    It really is "food art," that is, the dishes they create were thoughtfully executed with precision as to what types of foods were to pair with which, so the melodies of flavours would play off of one another nicely.   \n\nA small tip from me: go in with an intellectual mind and not a hungry stomach.   Portions are tiny, but that is not the mere point here.   I think the Chef wants us to take a little moment and savour in small bites, close our eyes, taste the different textures and flavours marrying one another in your mouth - ooh, and they do it sooooo well.   \n\nDefinitely, I would titled this experience, "My Love Affair with Ursa."   Culinary delights at its finest. \n\nSo, in the end, why a four star and not a perfect five?   I can't say I am in love with ALL the dishes that they've created.  Maybe I am just not a daring cookie.   Some flavours, I find,  didn't really go too well with one another and I feel like it's just being used as a garnish, because well... it makes the dish looks more appealing, visually.  lolz.   I am still a Traditionalist at heart, when it comes to food and maybe that prevented it from me giving it a perfect five.
