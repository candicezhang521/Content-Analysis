-18YJeEWx5JPyVNOlQKqyg	5	2013-05-23 00:00:00	My favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, somewhere I know I can go and get a great steak and have a great atmosphere to share with friends or family.  I have been going to Delmonico since about four year ago and I have never been disappointed once.\n\nOne of my favorite things about this place is every time I have made a reservation I have always got seated almost exactly on time.  This place is not cheap nor is it too overpriced compared to other steakhouses in Las Vegas that don't even come close to this one.\n\nOne of my favorite things is they have an great selection of scotches and bourbon, the have a separate menu for it and if you like either please make sure and check it out.\n\nGive this place a try and know that I recommend it to everyone.	2	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	dAc8XwuTkLZibyWTFAYgVw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
-2QZjEm6coyl3YQ7YHeOXA	3	2011-04-11 00:00:00	Was excited to go here since it was Emerille's Steakhouse.  We had reservations for 8PM and waited at the bar while they got our table ready. The waiter was really nice and friendly.  They brought us bread which they placed individually on our plates. I started with the spinach and arugula salad, which was super good. I was glad to have had that in my stomach, since it took a while to get our steaks.\n\nI ordered the filet, medium and a side of asparagus.  The steak was seared a little too much and tasted a little burnt.  They also topped it off with a pad of butter.  By no means was it a bad steak, but for the price, I guess I expected more.  The asparagus was good but also very buttery.  Good food, but I have definitely had better.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	drrUNO_oPVFTCl0Piew-0Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
-79slJ5_z6FVKG86yQAPaA	4	2012-08-31 00:00:00	2012 Fall Restaurant Week Lunch #2. \n\nWhether you're visiting Delmonico on a regular night, special occasion, or during Restaurant Week as I did, from the amazing lunch I had with extraordinary service and exceptional food, I'd recommend it to anyone. 4.5 stars at least.\n\nWe seem to be the first party seated for lunch. Our two servers worked well together, being knowledgeable, catering, and attentive from beginning to end. Even as more customers started to come in and they had more to attend to, they still did an amazing job making sure we were taken care of.\n\nWhat we put in our tummies:\n(pictures posted)\n\n1st Course\nTraditional New Orleans\nChicken & Andouille Sausage Gumbo\n\n2nd Course\nButternut Squash Ravioli\nPrime Cheeseburger w/ Bacon\n\n3rd Course\nEmeril's Banana Cream Pie\nPecan Pie\n\nI'm no expert on gumbo, but I found it very tasty. Still steaming in individual serving pots, it was poured over rice table-side. Very nice touch. The burger was an enormous 11oz, well-seasoned, cooked medium as requested, hearty and meaty as burgers should be. Fries were just...fries. It was my first experience with butternut squash ravioli, and I loved it. Sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese made these raviolis sweet and flavorful.\n\nThe highlight of the food was unquestionably the desserts. I never order banana cream pie, but I'm a big believer in trying whatever is the signature item, especially when it's written "Emeril's Banana Cream Pie." I'm sure it's not made very traditionally, but OH MY GOSH. Made with sweet bananas, the pie filling felt more like a cheesecake. Topped with chocolate shavings, amazing crust, this dessert will be what I think of from this day forward when anyone says banana cream pie. You think the way I described it, how could the pecan pie even compete?! Well, it did! Served warm and moist, it was decadent and comforting.\n\nI was beginning to wonder if the Restaurant Week event and menus were affecting my experiences at these places I've been eagerly wanting to try. I was very excited to participate, awaiting delicious gourmet food at a great price at a fine-dining establishment, helping a worthy cause. \n\nPersonally, I'm very happy to say Delmonico made me want to become a repeat customer, again and again. It's so hard not to give 5 stars, but I would want to experience dining here on a non-Restaurant Week to confidently say it was as amazing as I remembered this lunch. \n\nI'm very much looking forward to coming back. And soon!	12	4	6	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The salads and sides (asparagus, potatoes) were excellent. They also have a fine wine selection. This place takes steak on another level!

I'm drooling just thinking about the wonderful birthday meal I had here (courtesy of dearest Hubby).\n\nI loved how the theme of the restaurant was very New Orleans/Cajun inspired.\n\nBefore we even ordered, we got to try these ox tail thingies, compliments of the chef. Pretty good.\n\nWe started with the BBQ shrimp. Delish.\n\nI had the filet, and Hubby had the bone-in filet. According to him, it was extremely good, and he liked it better than the bone-in at Fleming's. I absolutely loved my filet. It had a cajun spice flavor, and it was so good that I didn't even want to dip it in Emeril's version of A1 sauce (yeah.. it's an Emeril restaurant.. didn't know that till I looked at the menu, and I admit initially I was a little turned off by that).\n\nWe shared asparagus and mushrooms as sides, and their mushrooms were superb. They didn't use the button mushrooms that most steakhouses use. Instead, I think they were shiitake mushrooms, or some sort of mushrooms that tasted similar/looked similar to shiitake mushrooms. Either way, very good.\n\nWe ended the meal with a complimentary sorbet that was yum, and we also ordered their dessert of the night, which was a blackberry cheesecake that was yum as well.\n\nLastly, according to Hubby, they had a great wine selection.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	UVg9-TVTipQuyHXPkaTJuA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
-9dbp_WyOGoVPkeqw1xpBw	4	2015-08-26 00:00:00	Ordered the seafood tower at $130 came with oysters on the half shell, 2 lobster tails split in half which were slightly overlooked and rubbery. A handful of shrimp which tasted farm raised and lacked a good wild shrimp taste. Tuna tartare was great and the crab legs were great.\n\nWarm wilted spinach salad ($15) came out with a deep fried soft boiled egg and bacon with candy pecans baked on it. There was spinach in there but a 2000 calorie salad isn't really that much of a salad. Still it was good.\n\nAdded to that the bone in 45 day aged ribeye ($50). That was magnificent. Huge, flavorful and all around award winning.  Had the creamed spinach ($10), creamed corn ($10) and steak fries ($10). The creamed corn want good. It was just bland. The rest were good.\n\nService is exceptional. Had a few Tito vodka Martina's with blue cheese olives as well Jacob were expertly made. For 5 of us the total bill was close to $1000. Be prepared to spend $$$.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2jjN1wl0bBRKprffzNa1Uw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
-9HWRNoGZOort6u95kC27w	4	2008-03-24 00:00:00	Nestled back in the row of restaurants in the Venetian Hotel and Casino, Delmonico Steakhouse owned and operated by Chef Emeril Lagasse.  Offering up Orleans-style eats in a comfortable setting.  High back armless leather chairs and white linen set tables are scattered amongst white walls with pillars and great sloping arches.  A uniquely curved ceiling provided an interesting twist on the events of the night, as I was able to clearly listen in on several conversations from other tables as if they were seated next to me.  I only wonder if they were listening in on us?\n\nOn the way to our table we passed by a wall of wine encased in glass.  It was impressive to say the least and perusing their wine list hinted to the fact that it wasn't the only wall of wine in the establishment.  After calling for a nice bottle of champagne we ordered off of the menu and enjoyed an amuse buche.  A sort of pre-appetizer, a bite or two of something tasty, like something you might get at a cocktail party.\n\nThe wait staff was at our side at all times to make sure we had ample amounts of liquids and dinner breads.  We made a little joke how I was not able to finish my meal because the waitress kept calling for my bread dish to be refilled..."Would you like some more bread sir?"  If she had asked how I was feeling I would have responded "Better!"  I would had surely thrown in an extra hundred on the gratuity if she followed through with the Python joke or offered a thin wafer mint.\n\nI could go through all the parts of the meal but we know from previous reviews that the food is above board in the field of taste.  My only comment in regard to anything on the menu would be to the quality of the beef.  I am by no means a steak snob but I know quality beef when I taste it.  Having tasted beef from different locations around the world from Kansas to Kobe, Delmonico Steakhouse has much room to improve their quality of steak.  No matter how well seasoned or prepared the order was, if you start out with average prime beef you will be eating average prime beef and for that they lose one star.\n\nIf you do happen to stop by and eat at Delmonico, I suggest the sorbet desert, the multitude of tasty wines and the special... whatever it is.\n\nBe prepared for the price, because this place is proud of their food.  Four guests, champagne dinner with desert was well over $100 per person.  Will we be back?  But of course!  Las Vegas is the place for over indulgences.  What happens in Vegas... along with your money, stays in Vegas so enjoy it while you are there.	2	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AuEH3Bma-alVvLiuLBj6_A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
-AfWnumxLUcgx69eN1WmIQ	5	2013-02-27 00:00:00	I came here with some girlfriends during my Bachelorette weekend in Vegas. We had a reservation for 7 girls, and were very promptly sat at our reservation hour.\n\nThe service here is spectacular, and the food is equally enjoyable. My girls and I shared our entrees and side dishes, so that we could each have a taste of a little bit of everything.\n\nEntrees:\n- FILET MIGNON - 9 oz, and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth yummy. This cut was like BUTTER.\n- EMERIL'S BBQ SALMON - Also melted like butter with every bite. It was amazing how tender, yet well-cooked the fish was. The hash side dish that came with the meal was very complimentary!\n- GRILLED MARINATED ORGANIC CHICKEN BREAST - Mostly juicy (a teeny bit dry), but great flavors. The fingerling potatoes were pretty standard, and the wild mushrooms weren't very tasty to me.\n- BONE IN RIBEYE - 20 oz, and great for sharing! Our waiter even cut the steak for our girls so that each could have medium rare/well.\n- AMERICAN RED SNAPPER - the sides didn't seem as appealing at first for my friend who had this dish, but she ended up enjoying them!\n\nSides:\n- CREAMED CORN GRATINÉE - delicious. A great combination of that sweet and salty flavor. Texture was right on point!\n- BUTTERED FRESH ASPARAGUS - fabulous crunch, and not so much flavor added to cover up the natural enjoyable flavor of the veggie\n\nAll in all, a great experience. We weren't too full at the end of the meal, and didn't have to worry about wasting any food or taking back any leftovers.\n\nHighly recommended!	4	1	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	FmoHNtcIw6reY7IX5eV97g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I liked the mood and settings of the restaurant. We got a quiet cozy corner. Order a few glasses of read wine to go with the filet I ordered. Overall, it was a good experience. Nothing spectacularly special. Food was above average.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	TVMmYI09y8-zJKiDfHEbSQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
-cnWnD1w8gHyqr62N1pKwQ	2	2007-04-15 00:00:00	Date: July 8, 2005\nLocation: The Venetian Resort Hotel & Casino, Las Vegas\nCorkage: $25/bottle\nCost: $450 - party of four (including tax, tip & corkage)\nReservation: 702.414.3737\nWebsite: www.emerils.com\n\nTo my surprise, got a last minute reservation through opentable.com just a couple of days before the trip to Vegas. So instead of Fleming's, Capital Grille, or BOA, the three other places I had thought about to kick off my friend's bachelor party weekend, this is where we end up for dinner on the Friday night.\n\nThe four of us arrived about 15 minutes early and were promptly seated, busy but not completely packed.\n\nThe service was above average, but not warm, mechanical is the best word to describe. I asked for the three bottles of wine I brought to be decanted, which was no problem at all. No Riedels, but nice enough stemware to pass.\n\nWe ordered an antipasto for the table to get started. I had the Classic Steak Tartare as the appetizer and had the dry-aged Bone In Rib Steak as the entree.\n\nThe Classic Steak Tartare is the best presentation of such I've seen. Tartare in the center with individual garnishes fanned out, completed with baguette toast points. Flavor was good, but missing the bam element I expected.\n\nThe Rib Steak I ordered was suppose to be medium-rare, but was closer to a medium, which was fine by me, as I tend to like it somewhere in between the two. Word of caution here, all four steaks we had at our table, the temperature were missed by close to one notch, rare = medium rare, medium-rare = medium...etc.\nGood piece of raw material, but the kitchen failed to make it stand-out. Again, seasoning was lacking, salt and pepper can definitely be used more liberally.\n\nOrdered three desserts to pass around the table to finish the dinner, nothing interesting here to write home about.\n\nThe total including tax, tip and corkage came out to be $450 for the four of us, not a bad price tag especially considering we are in Vegas.\n\nWith this outing, I think I am completely done with top name destination Vegas restaurants. Aureole, Bradley Ogden, \nPicasso and now this, none has given me a desire to visit for a second time.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	geJV8EiTITinkq4aKtTz2g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
-IC2GPJC-lOtcYQ_s1e8Cw	3	2009-12-30 00:00:00	Food quality disappointing. Not the best steak in Vegas.\n\nThree of us enjoyed two ribeyes ($52) and one filet ($46). Waiter told us their ribeye is the best steak in Vegas, but don't believe it. They were cooked correctly. The rub was rather bland and the crusting on the filet was hard. On a scale of one to ten, my ribeye overall was a 7. I've had 10's before in Vegas, so the competition is tough! But just claiming you have the best steak doesn't make it so.\n\nThe sides ($9 each) were disappointing. We ordered four. Creamed spinach, always a favorite of mine and recommended by the waiter, was just odd and bland - didn't taste interesting or flavorful at all. The best side was the asparagus, but honestly, how hard is it to steam asparagus?\n\nDesert, as it often is at these kind of places where desert is an afterthought, was disappointing and ended the overall experience on a "blah" note.\n\nWine list was excellent.\n\nWith so many great places in Vegas, you can do much better. Everything else was top notch, but the food is the core of the experience and Delmonicos is just average, unfortunately.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	0sn90kt7lKl3_igSMQBt8w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

-ogKPaiHquD1m6SxdfjRWQ	4	2011-02-09 00:00:00	First impressions......Unfortunately, Delmonico Steakhouse made a huge mistake when they seated my party of three at the table right in front of the kitchen door with a restaurant that was less than half full.  Offensive and unacceptable.  The hostess ran in one direction and a staff member told us we would have to make our way back up to the front to deal with this issue when we told them that this would not work for us.  After a word with someone who claimed to be the manager at the front, we were reseated and promptly given complimentary truffle chips (that can solve any bad first impression).  The truffle chips are not to be missed.  \n\nService-  Our server eventually warmed up and was pleasant.   He was so caught up in his speeches about different parts of the menu and recommendations, that it took some time to see his true personality.  He was also rushed, which was odd, as we had some menu questions.  \n\nFood-  The filet was magical.  This is the primary reason that the restaurant got 4 stars.  The creole seasoning and dab of BUTTER on the steak were an amazing and sinful treat.  Really delicious.\n\nThe cheese grits were delicious.  I was a bit less impressed with the creamed spinach.  The waiter said that it was better than CUT's version.  NO WAY!  Underwhelming.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	qOODN0RsLbNQaLPN3srixQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
-oOG6KY0rPY51DsmpwG6hA	4	2009-10-12 00:00:00	Great Steakhouse. I was delighted to come and try this place. I haven't heard too much about what the steak was like hear but I heard all good things about it. \n\nAs we sat down we were great by two men who were going to be our servers and our waiters for the day. I ended up ordering a Bone In rib Steak. I think it was the most expensive steak on the menu. I wasn't too sure about the size but my friends that came before said that it was a good size and that some of them couldn't finish it. \n\nWhen I finally got the steak. It had a little piece of butter on the top and it looked good. I usually have my steak medium and it was perfect. I loved it. We also ordered some sides of grits, spinach and mushrooms. Those were ok to me. I loved the steak though. I wasn't able to eat the last 3 oz or so. I think it was well over 16 oz steak with the bone. I think everyone finished theirs except for me. I did notice that my friend said the my steak looked bigger. I couldn't complain at all. All in all we spend about $80 for dinner. I didn't order anything besides the steak and splitting the appetizers. \n\nIt was well worth it. I have spent more at other places and not even felt like I was eating enough. This takes the cake. \n\nI liked how the servers were prompt with filling up my water and attentive to our needs. They would even fold your dinner napkin if you left the table. Awesome. I felt somewhat cramped on our circular table, but what do you expect from a large group of 9 guys.	2	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	6Cdk-pX_f4cqSLShzf37Uw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Here is a summary of one of my experiences that I shared with one of my foodie friends when we ate here. \n\nWe ordered the Caesar Salad which was spectacularly prepared fresh able side by the maitre 'd. It was like $30 but probably THE best salad of my life! Next was the bone in rib eye which was so perfectly seasoned and cooked! I'm a huge fan of sides so I got the creamed spinach, a Idaho baked potato, creamed corn, and asparagus. YES, there were amazing left overs!\n\nFor dessert of course it was the White Chocolate Macadamia nut Bread Pudding! If anyone knows Emril's shows or books you know this is like his signature item. I have also had the Duck Egg Creme Brulee which is heavenly as well. But my go to is the bread pudding!\n\nThis is a place you probably wouldn't wanna eat at daily, but it is a place to take special friends who enjoy good food at it's best or for an awesome night of self spoiling! :)\n\n*Lobster bique, the butternut squash ravioli and the fried chicken are killer too!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ZOXLXDo1C8nlW5a_2RpvKg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
-UzdyS3-vyL2zrmx6OngDA	3	2015-09-01 00:00:00	It is with a heavy heart, a disappointed palate, and an empty stomach that I write this review. At around 8:40pm on a Wednesday like any other, an amazing 20 ounce bone-in ribeye was murdered by the cooks at Delmonico Steakhouse in Las Vegas, Nevada. A senseless, tragic loss really. \n\nThe LD: Husband and I went for dinner. Were seated immediately; had reservations. Place was crowded; however, several tables were empty. Servers (yes, plural; they employ a multi-function staff system) were friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nV&S for myself, beer for hub. Both ordered the highly recommended in-house aged big ass ribeye; cooked med-rare please? Add a side of asparagus. \n\nDrinks were delivered, as was a meh amuse bouche (didn't do much to invoke my appetite). While waiting on main course, we sat with empty drink glasses for approximately 15 minutes. "Yes, please, another round" after flagging someone down.  \n\nThe highly anticipated steaks arrived. Had SO looked forward to dining (have been to Delmonico in N'Oleans and LOVED it) - salivating for the meat like Pavlov's dog.\n\nHusband cut into his steak first and I awed at the perfection. Beautifully cooked (I know my steak temps well and am quite skilled on the grill if I may say so; #humblebrag, but I do live in Texas after all). I could immediately tell when my plate was sat down in front of me my steak was overcooked. I even whispered it to my spouse. Sure enough, borderline well-done on the edges. I optimistically had hoped it would be less done toward the thicker center and toward the bone. Nope.   \n\nWhen a waiter came to follow-up and ask how the steak was, I informed him mine...well, was not good. He did offer to refire; however, given the speed that my husband eats, and the amount of time it took the food to be delivered in the first place, I [foolishly] declined and stated that it was "fine."\n\nManagement comped one of the two Tito's I ordered as an apology; however, this did little to suppress my internal sadness and the most amount of disappointment I'd had since losing my ars at the blackjack tables the night before. \n\nIn all fairness, the staff at D's did try their best to accommodate. I probably should have allowed them a second chance to present a well-prepared piece of beef. It wasn't until I got home and found the $164 (w/out tip) receipt from the night in my wallet that I began to feel what can only be described as selfish-remorse (aka, sometimes referred to as "buyer's remorse").\n\nSo after a few days of ruminating (as females are sometimes known to do), I called the restaurant and told them I regretted my decisions and to thank them for at least attempting to "satisfy the customer." Without any provocation, the manager offered to send me a gift card for $50 to cover a steak during my next visit. I, of course, did not expect the offer, but happily provided my mailing address. \n\nI have found that an unfortunate outcome of many "celebrity" chef restaurants opening in LV is that the quality of both service and food suffer. It's the nature of Sin City and the abundance of tourism - people from all over the world with very different palates - some more or less discerning than others. :'(  \n\nSo, now I have a GC that I can redeem at any of Emeril's establishments. I doubt I'll be using it at Delmonico in Vegas baby, because frankly I've left the building and think I'll stick to D's in the Big Easy. Sin City killed the beefy magic for me.

I'm used to steakhouses having a great classic feel that welcomes you in. This place was drab, and nothing special. As for our steaks, they were just ok; we expected much more. The heirloom tomatoes and burrata were a nice starter. But our overall experience was of a place we'd not return to. When you pay over $40 for a steak, it should be delicious.	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ZRLxSb4SipLtOlYAmvDsAA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

They had a carmelized onion,Mushroom mixture with a Parmesan crust that absolutely sent them into Orbit !!!!! Not to mention the Prime Dry Aged Filet that was literally "Cake" tender and had a deep beef flavor. We also had the Jumbo Australian Lobster tail that was sweet and cooked to perfection in a white wine reduction with aromatic veggies/herbs($95).May I also suggest the Bone In Ribeye($55) which is the house specialty....it's to die for !!!!  In regards to attire it seems like a dressy place but folks were showing up with Tommy Bahama Shirts,Shorts and flip flops and were seated without question and some were "dudded up". My wife and I ate for about $200 but it was worth every penny !This a must stop for a special dinner if your a steak lover !!!!   Oh....our table as well as everyone else's had four servers and a host !!!! Exemplary Service	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2zw5pNWAyn0vXxAylutJtg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We are fortunate to have experienced Michael Jackson's tailored hospitality, authentic personality, and genuine interest in our dining. Of course the food is excellent, but we come here because our service is impeccable.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	abzDYj8JKz8-YQslYuzBuQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
-_v74X2wIQ5BBul7zaFIJQ	4	2012-09-13 00:00:00	Been wanting to go here for a long time so when a media contact/vendor asked me to lunch here I didn't hesitate!  The ambiance was lovely, low light, tasteful decorations, great big leather chairs.  We had water, bbq shrimp, lobster sliders, steak medallions with side of garlic mashed, chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  \n\nBBQ shrimp was delicious!  Had a homemade bbq sauce that was just tangy, sweet and rich enough.  Large shrimp came with about five I think very yummy.  \n\nMy entree was the something something steak medallions - (sorry it's not on the lunch menu online and I can't remember exactly what it was called) it was EXTRAORDINARY.  I think after looking through the photos they were the Filet Mignon Medallions - I am a red meat junkie and before this Carnevino was the best steak I ever had - this one ranks right up there.  Perfectly medium rare, flavorful with delicious meaty mushrooms, and as tender as a steak could be.  Just delicious.  Be warned it doesn't come with ANYTHING - just the meat so be sure and order a side dish or two.  I ordered the garlic mashed potatoes which come in this cool metal pan/dish thing.  They are a very large portion so that was good.  The mashed potatoes were soooooooooooooo creamy.  Very very good.  \n\nWe ordered the chocolate layer cake with coconut ice cream for dessert.  This is why I gave only four stars - the cake a'ight.  Nothing special.  It was enormous though so you'll get the bang for your buck.  My sister is a pastry chef so I might be a little extra picky on my dessert but there you have it.  \n\nFor what we ordered plus my vendor ordered an additional 3-scoop bowl of coconut ice cream on the side it came to $91.  It's pricey - so be sure to eat the warm bread they give you at the beginning so you can be full, lol.  But the portion sizes were generous, the service was INCREDIBLE and the food delish.	4	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	kWCkJR_xj2av_tS29q-QWA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
01RayFuJwHLqrQ30SrBP-A	4	2009-01-30 00:00:00	Delmonico's is an institution - but it's by no means a "5-Star" steakhouse.  Historically, it was one of the first really credible celebrity chef steakhouses in Vegas - despite the fact that Emeril Lagasse really wasn't the founder of the original Delmonico's of New Orleans.\n\nBAD NEWS:  NOT UP TO PAR WITH THE NEW ORLEANS ORIGINAL\nPatterned after the original which resides in New Orleans, Delmonico's serves delicious, beefy steaks with services & class befitting a Louisiana.  For those of you who've been to the New Orleans steakhouse, let me assure you that like the Vega rendition of "Commander's Palace", you will NOT get the same quality at the Vegas "Delmonico's".    And that's a shame because to this day, one of the top 3 steaks I've ever eaten was at the New Orleans' Delmonico's... not the Vegas location.\n\nGOOD NEWS:  IT'S STILL A GOOD PLACE FOR STEAKS\nBut I don't think you'll leave terribly disappointed.  Everything from the cigars to the baked potato to the crab legs and lobster tails to the steaks themselves - it's all still pretty good.  (More on the beef later.)  Items are always served hot, and plates are served in synchronicity to all guests with multiple waiters.  The wine list is the size of Godzilla and their humidor has a colossal assortment of cigars that would make Bill Clinton giddy.\n\nAND WHAT ABOUT THE STEAKS, SERVICE, ETC.?\nHere's the thing:  They prepare it correctly every time and their service is their hallmark.  However when it comes to different categories (Flavor, service, décor) it kinda varies on how they rank:\n1) FLAVOR\nI have to hand it to Envy the Steakhouse over Delmonico's and I think Charlie Palmer's outdoes it as well in most aspects.  Michael Mina's StripSteak probably outdoes it for at least flavor.  Meanwhile Craftsteak has consistently softer, more buttery servings of the same cuts.  It's probably a close tie with PRIME Steakhouse at the Bellagio.  \n...but it beats going to CUT, Carnevino, N9NE Steakhouse, & Circus Circus Steakhouse in my experience.  \n2) SERVICE\nIf you're looking for prompt service with an attention to detail, it's hard to beat Delmonico's.  That's something they have down really well.  Only Envy & Charlie Palmer's probably rival it and Envy only gets the nod because there's rarely many people there so service is often 1 to 1.  Everyone else kinda pales in comparison - especially CUT & StripSteak where I've consistently gotten sketchy service.  I strongly suspect that my service would have been 3x better had I had my host make the reservation instead of calling it in myself.\n3) DÉCOR\nIt's darker, candlelit ambiance is romantic but not very illustrious compared to the views of PRIME or the décor of Carnevino.  Most steakhouses I've noticed are pretty bland and non-descript in general (N9NE is utterly weird - what with all the white walls and junk) though so I'm not sure this is really a big point.  \n\nCONCLUSION:\nDelmonico's, while it's lost some luster compared to some of the other big name talents in the Vegas steak industry, still holds its own amongst the heavyweights.  Kind of a reasonably reliable, middle of the pack, horse that you can depend on for a decent - but pricey - meal.\n\n3 1/2-stars... rounded up, as a tip of the hat to tradition.\n\n-----------------\nINSIDER'S TIP:  GETTING INTO DELMONICO'S WITHOUT A RESERVATION\nVery simple:  $50 to the maitre d' will quietly grease your way from having a cocktail at the bar to a table with immediate service usually within 60 seconds - no questions asked.  You'll either need to reach over registration to pass the bill to him/her or call him/her around to shake his hand and simply mention that you appreciate their hard work getting you a table.  \n...In general, tips really work at Delmonico's in all aspects of the restaurant.  From the wait staff to the bartender to the resident sommelier.  I've pulled this more than a dozen times without fail with the maitre d' during booked solid conventions from CES recently to going back to the COMDEX days.  \n...This may seem obvious to some, but the key is that the tip angle on 'immediate seating' only works in places where tables are reserved for hotel VIPs.  (For example, Nobu's really has no such seating other than "next table available")	4	4	4	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	hU46otnbSfdU5oI0zhJGoA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
01ZZ9LUOJGeFQmi-P7WsOw	4	2015-04-01 00:00:00	Delmonicos is a great restaurant, there is no doubt about that. I ordered a Bone in Rib eye medium rare.  The steak was cooked to perfection.  I felt it lack the salt and pepper seasoning on the crust.  I ended up having to get some finishing salt to give it a little more flavor.  \n\nI will go there again if I stay at the Palazzo, but I still have a preference to a couple other steaks houses.  service was great, food was great. just thought the steak could have been a little better seasoned.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	R4fC5darovG78B1-rHB13w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The steaks had absolutely NO flavor, the options weren't good and the ahi salad with a whopping 3 small pieces of tuna was far from worth the cost. I come to the Venetian very often as an invited guest and have never had such a sub-par dining experience. With so many other great options don't bother with this one....	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	RpNave-qiDUQ_EGHdL6CIA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

0c78qW-v15_AmHP2e7fQPQ	1	2011-01-27 00:00:00	i have to admit, i had a bad experience at this steakhouse from the service being so-so to the food being o.k. the biggest disappointment is that my girlfriends steak and my steak were both cooked incorrectly. i ordered my steak medium rare, my gal medium well. at first i thought the waiter got us mixed up regarding how we wanted our steaks cooked because mines was well done and my girl friends was on the rare side. so when our waiter came back and asked us how everything was, i asked him, "how did i order my steak?" he replied, medium rare. i got my steak knife and cut right down the middle of my steak and showed it to the waiter and he glanced at it and replied, looks like it was over cooked slightly. my girlfriend and i both noticed that our waiter was not exactly polite after we pointed out our steaks were cooked incorrectly and didn't offer to bring us new steaks knowingly that the cook blew it by a long shot with the beef. my steak was honestly cooked all the way through. no red and not even any pink. not the end of the world. though this was our saturday night dinner in vegas and we have heard sooo many good things about this restaurant. so we were quite disappointed when we had a somewhat rude waiter and food which was cooked incorrectly. we are going to try this place one more time and give them another shot. i think we just got unlucky. irregardless i have to give the rating in which they provided. sorry delmonico, maybe next time.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	cwouS-sp6jCefXrASE6CLg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

While we'd had to put up with snobby staff at Valentino, the wait staff at Delmonico was informed, helpful, friendly, and a lot of fun to interact with.  And THE FOOD !!!  Oh my word, our ribeye steak was so fabulous we couldn't wait to try it again and went back the very next day for more of the same.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3PevbGmbxoP37j_XvkJGtg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I also got a lychee drink which was pretty good but probably too expensive for me to ever order again.

0f0eG481o_jUk5R7Rnt-ig	2	2010-07-01 00:00:00	Went for my wife's Birthday and was very unimpressed with the food and service. Went to a show before so I dropped a wonderful bottle of wine before and felt insulted when the man at the front desk said "you know there is a $25 fee for corkage". If he would have bothered to look at the bottle he would have noticed that it was a very high end bottle of Napa Cab. Anyhow, we were seated and our waiter was trying to tell us how smart and connected he was with all the wineries and  then mispronounced the name of our wine. He never offered to decant it, that was unacceptable. So I ordered the Bone in Rib Eye and it was the toughest piece of steak I have had in a long time. My wife had he filet and loved it. We had creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms for our side, They were average at best. After mentioning the steak issue the waiter said he would "let somebody know". He never came back during service so I never had the chance to send it back. The waiter came back and said that corkage was $ 30 and he got someone to waive it. Funnt the guy up front said it was $ 25. Bottom line was Delmonico did not produce 5 Star food or service. Will not go back.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	q6tVj_J2fyfJ9zEUhX85bg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The price is decent for an upscale dining restaurant. \n\nI tried other dishes my friends got and they weren't as good. My friends didn't really enjoy their filet mignon. I tried the pork chop and I thought the sauce was very salty. The bacon appetizer was good but tasted a bit salty as well. The creamed corn was very good but I didn't really like the bread crumbs on top of it. The creamed spinach was just ok. The potato side dish was just ok too. \n\nIf you have an occasion you are celebrating they give you a sorbet. They also gave us a small mousse type dish for being there for the first time so that was nice. The decor is simple and had a nice ambiance. It's a nice place to try in Venetian regardless.	3	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	FziBgPaiqRJM71FExiJQ3Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I would suggest SW Steakhouse or Gordon Ramsay instead. \n\nHere's the salient-\n\nService\nThe Staff was friendly enough but nothing special. There was a LOUD diner (really loud as I'm from NYC and used to noisy restaurants) and, despite my request, my server did not ask the guy to take it down a notch. \n\nFood\n- The popovers, to start, were good but I was disappointed that no other bread was offered, which is usually the case with steakhouses.\n- The word that comes to mind when describing the quality of the filet is mediocre. It looked like it had been pulverized with a meat mallet. Pretty bland and not juicy at all.\n- My friend did enjoy his pork chop and it looked much better than my steak. \n- The twice baked potato was a big disappointment given that the bottom of it felt rock hard and the whipped potato on top was bland.\n- The fried apple pies were adequate. My friend really liked the pecan pie.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	K6HUVBroANx8ODIZWL79Bg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
0Q117LO-OKX0I_vVer5fjA	4	2009-08-05 00:00:00	I'm struggling to figure out why I am rating this four stars instead of five. I guess that five stars is perfection and nothing is perfect, right? \n\nWe (me, wife, and my parents) at here on Sunday, August 2, at 7:00. We reserved via OpenTable and were promptly seated in a very nice location. Even though the restaurant was busy the tables on either side of us were kept empty until we were leaving, which was a very nice touch. My wife and I, and my parents, were celebrating our wedding anniversaries, and I noted this with OpenTable. This was communicated to the restaurant and they treated us very nice. \n\nThe service was extremely good. Each table is assigned three people: a head waiter, an assistant waiter, and a buser. All were very polite and professional. The buser was a bit green but that is OK; her mistakes were very minor. The head waiter was exceptional - I don't remember his name and I feel bad for not being able to call him out and recognize him here. The second waiter was also very good; again, I forget her name. \n\nVery good bread was brought to the table and a complimentary appetizer was served to us that consisted of a very yummy chicken salad. My wife and I ordered the table-side Caesar salad and it was worth the $30. The table-side preparation is neat to watch, and she did a great job with it. The entire salad is made from scratch at the table. This Caesar goes right to the top of my list as my very favorite Caesar and almost makes up for the beat-down I got at the Palazzo's craps table right before dinner. My dad ordered a shrimp cocktail that looked excellent. \n\nMy dad and I both had the boneless rib eye and my mom and wife split the filet. It was all good; in fact, I could have used a smaller steak. The waiter said it was 14-16 ounces but this was definitely bigger. For sides we ordered the asparagus, which I don't eat, and the small potatoes with garlic, which were very good. \n\nI had a root beer float for dessert - I liked the fact that there were some old favorites on the dessert menu, including peach cobbler. \n\nWith two bottles of wine (at $65/bottle) we spent over $400 (before tip) on dinner but all agreed that it was money well spent. \n\nAbout the only negative is the couple who brought a very small child (6 months?) into the restaurant with them. The baby wasn't doing well and cried somewhat - shame on the parents.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Ult6n4oRODIS-8dT34FelA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The meal was rich, decadent, and as everything I imagined it to be! I even split the steak and left very, very full. The foie gras reminded me of when I ate my way through eastern Europe 4 years ago. I've had a really tough time finding comparable seared foie gras State-side until I came here.\n\nAll of the sides were delicious. I think I had the creamed corn, spinach, and mushrooms.\n\nSkip the BBQ shrimp. It was a big disappointment coming from a man who prides himself in creole/cajun cooking.\n\nThe restaurant itself is really intimate. The ceilings are low and vaulted, so it's like you're in an underground church or something. My one gripe is that it's a little noisy because of the set up. \n\nOf course, the service was wonderful, as expected. We were a group of 12 or so girls, there for a bachelorette party, and they handled us efficiently and graciously.\n\nIt's a great place to go if you're up on poker and want to splurge on a big slice of meat!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	rdjGugp_bcHecvS2cHzl6Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Everyone knows the real reason to go to steak houses is for the side dishes and they do have good side dishes.  Our server was also very friendly about our changing party size and I had no problems with the reservations.  I am giving it 4 instead of 5 bc of ambiance- they could have done a little better here.  It is a little boring and white-walled, plus the bar area feels too open to the casino for me.  Plus side though it is right around the corner from the new Barneys so you can buy bags or shoes before/after.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4IqHX5hGxzmuE-37_FogwQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

169pajMYDIdSy06fOgSy_g	3	2011-01-15 00:00:00	Delmonico Steakhouse was pretty good, but definitely not the best I've had nor without flaws.\n\nThe food and drink choices seem to be where they really excel, as there were a number of options that my girlfriend and I found to be mouth-watering, from the bone-in ribeye, the fillet, the chicken, salmon, etc.  They had my favorite beer (Chimay Blue) and she enjoyed her wine (she had the Chardonnay and Riesling).  What we wanted when going here was a nice, fancy dinner as a tribute to our vacation together.  It wasn't a special occasion or anything but we like to have a quality dinner from time to time.  I'd say the food part of Emeril's more or less did the trick with regards to that.\n\nThe service was OK.  While they were relatively prompt the matre'd was the person who seemed to be serving us and he was just a little too over-the-top for me, not to mention he seemed a little condescending and careless.  Perhaps I just read into it wrong, but I didn't feel as comfortable as I have at other restaurants.  Our waiters made sure the waters and bread kept coming, which I appreciated.  The matre'd didn't really do anything rude per-say, but I did notice that at one point when he came by to check on everything he spoke with the tables on our left and right but not with us.  \n\nThe smaller tables are a little too big IMO, my girlfriend and I felt a mile away from each other and eventually I just moved my place settings next to her and sat with her so we could talk easier.  This is probably not an issue if you have a big group, but for a romantic evening it wasn't fantastic.  Speaking of romance, there were no candles, the lightning was bright, and the restaurant was devoid of decor. \n\nI don't mean to rip Delmonico's so much but I just want to stress that this restaurant really doesn't deserve 5 stars despite the food being pretty tasty.  Our stakes came out medium rare as requested, they were juicy and delicious, and the side "double-baked potato" + "Asparagus" was fantastic.\n\nI realized going here and glancing at the menu online that the prices were going to be steep but I guess my wallet received a shock even so.  I had initially been hoping that our bill would come to about $115-130, but in the end it was $200 because you have to buy sides for your meal separately and the wine / beer was very expensive.  The problem with this is that in Vegas there is a lot of competition and I've had food that was on par with this for under half the price of what I paid.  For instance Mon Ami Gabi (outside of Paris, Paris) and Trevi (Ceasar's Palace Forum Shops) both run in the $60-100 range (for two) and are just as tasty IMO.\n\nLastly, there were a nat or two flying around toward the end of our meal, something which is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber.  \n\nI enjoyed the overall experience but I would not dine here again.	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	lcrcput-8GMw6St64LIr9Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
1BQa5nKXLB3NnrVmGsXH6A	5	2010-02-20 00:00:00	if you're looking for a fancy steakhouse in vegas, delmonico is your go to place. not being a huge fan of emeril lagasse's, my prenotions and opinions were turned 180 degrees after one dining experience in this magnificent establishment.\n\nnothing here is shy of a stellar review. the food is PERFECTLY executed, the service is above and beyond, and no detail is left unfinished.\n\nthe steaks can be requested with an extra char on the outside, but the center is still a warm medium rare, perfectly juicy and exploding with flavor in every bite. the sides we ordered were also high acheivers and could be main courses in their own right. \n\nthe desserts were phenomenal! i've had emeril's banana cream pie from another one of his restaurants at MGM before, but the warm chocolate brioche bread pudding is like your birthday, christmas, new year, all the holidays, the birth of your first child, happiest day of your life in every spoonful. it was so good, i wanted to cry.\n\nif you are ever in vegas and want to have a flawless steak dinner, now you know where to go.	5	4	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4PIcs3X-Ro_KoczDJ3y4ZQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
1cbDJTDlDH7GIDTDOdJowQ	1	2014-05-29 00:00:00	This was by far the worst meal I have ever had.  Not steak,   Meal!  I went with a group of 4, only 1 steak was cooked correctly and it was super fatty. I had a filet ordered medium to medium well black, it showed up well done with no char whatsoever.  My friend ordered hers blue and it showed up rare. My husband's was fine but like I said super fatty. The other friends was over cooked as well along with the snottiest looking disgusting foie gras I have ever seen. Bottom line_ you go to Vegas to have a great meal and it sucked.  All of it sucked. Go somewhere else for $100pp.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	P1TybPWySTf4wPrIrk69Ew	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

EVERYTHING including the mushrooms were memorable, and we weren't even that hungry when we walked in. I wish Emeril would open one in San Francisco, so we can go back on our special occasions more conveniently.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	m5DgMl5LzafxOoNkbCUA4A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The food is terrific, the room is dignified and the service is what really takes it over the top. The staff here are true professionals and it shows. Very impressive. \n\nNo, it isn't cheap but then again, is any good Vegas restaurant? Sometimes you get what you pay for, and at Delmonico you get a terrific, classy dining experience. \n\nThe only disappointment: they no longer offer their New Orleans version of Oysters Rockefeller, which was one of my favorite appetizers anywhere. Our waiter told me they could make it happen next time if I call ahead and ask. I just might do that, and I'll definitely be back.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	W-CCdLdXMsnj6peNOgKL7A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The house special bacon-wrapped quail was cooked to perfection. But the banana cream pie was horrible. It almost seemed like we were served a slice that was two weeks old - Very dry and not very creamy.\nToo bad the meal ended with luke warm coffee and no refills to wash down the pie.

The service was great the food was good but CUT is a masterpiece the Mona Lisa.  I ordered the spinach salad which was very good fresh and delicious.  For my main course I ordered the bone in rib eye "house specialty"  it was great but it did not compare to the magic of my CUT ribeye.  This is an excellent restaurant the only flaw is its two minutes away from CUT!

I couldn't stop turning the pages of the wine list (evidently the largest wine list on the West Coast). The sides are unbelievable and complementary to the steak.

1LdNJCyZ6HVZV1zyieIy-A	4	2011-09-05 00:00:00	My Husband took me here for our anniversary dinner. We arrived early at five because we had theatre tickets and had made dinner reservations accordingly.  The restaurant is beautiful with cream walls, rock wood and glass throughout with romantic lighting the evening was looking good. We ordered starters Crab Cakes for my husband nice crispy well seasoned crab I love a crab cake that is more crab then filler and this one was that. I ordered the steak tartar because I've never had it and wanted to be daring. I have to say I was scared lol but it was so worth it. Wonderful crisp toasted baguettes with rich beef capers oil and seasoning and spicy mustard sauce  this has got to be one of the best dishes I've ever eaten and a must try. We then followed this with Lobster bisque  rich warm and creamy with plenty of lobster one of my favorite lobsters bisques definitely.  I had the petite iceberg lettuce wedges a nice take on the classic salad with Wisconsin blue cheese buttermilk dressing homemade apple wood bacon and just the right amount of red onion really tangy. For our entrée we had chosen to go with the  Chateaubriand for two. They carve it tableside and serve it with asparagus and garlic potatoes The sides were actually very good but the meat was just ok nothing special and more red then I care for We had also ordered a side of sautéed garlic wild mushrooms which were also just ok I've had better versions of both these dishes. On to dessert we were bad and ordered two. The Chocolate root beer float which was not that great I guess we just didn't care for the ginger and chocolate flavors together so we didn't finish this one but the banana cream pie was like biting into heaven little shavings of chocolate rich sweet whipped cream bananas and sweet rich caramel sauce make up this dish and it's worth every calorie that's probably packed into it. So splurge and have it it's amazing. The wait staff was amazing making sure you never wanted for anything and that everything went smoothly and the wine selection and service was top notch. Definitely worth the splurge	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	BybcTvf0el88wkvchX0fZg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
1nK5w0VNfDlnR3bOz13dJQ	5	2016-08-22 00:00:00	My husband and I went there for lunch on a Saturday. We had a physically exhausting week so we decided to treat ourselves. But it hasn't always been easy for our allergy whenever we ate out. So we called Delmonico ahead to see if they can accommodate our special needs. The lady who answered our call was very courteous and we felt comfortable to try after having some answers from her.\nAs we arrived, the restaurant has a comfortable ambience. I wouldn't say it is grand or special but just comfortable. When it was time to order, the server was courteous regarding our allergy too and I believe the one who took care of us was a manager. He even checked with the chef to make sure the complimentary popover was okay for us to consume. We told them we are allergic to soy, corn, peanut, tomato and pork products, and some other stuff, and he had been very mindful and advised accordingly as we ordered, he did it so graciously that we didn't feel being put in a spot. Some other semi high end restaurants had given us a startled face or even an uncomfortable face when we mentioned our allergy, but this manager was super professional that he didn't make us feel crappy about our differences from others. So he made a potential stressful situation easy for us, very impressive.\nTheir steak was aged in house by the restaurant and we think their aging was done fabulously as there was no rotten smell or taste in it. The manager even double checked with us and informed us that the beef was sourced from corn fed cows and asked if we would be able to tolerate that. And we made our decision to say yes and went ahead with the steak. Their steaks were very delicious. We actually asked for medium well with no seasoning and the steak still came out super delicious and juicy. So the good quality is in the steak itself and didn't need to depend on seasoning or being served bloodily. Again, very impressive.\nAnyway, it was a delicious meal and we were well taken care of so we didn't get sick from any event of undisclosed allergens. We are very happy with this meal. We would go back when we have another time wanting to treat ourselves again. Hopefully the manager will be there again the next time we visit.	1	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

With a show later, I made an early reservation for Delmonico.  I was promptly greeted and seated.\n\nI knew the steaks were large unless I got a petit filet (not my favorite cut of steak) so I ordered a bone in ribeye, a side of cheesy grits with bacon, and then bread pudding for dessert. I had a trio of servers who took good care of service.  \n\nI ordered the steak cooked blue and it was close to that but a bit beyond.  The steak was quite average.  The steak was pre-seasoned and it was OK.  The star of dinner was the cheesy grits with bacon.  They were very good!\n\nThe bread pudding was white chocolate macadamia nut with creme Anglaise.  It was OK, too.\n\nThe dinner never had any wow factor to merit the prices charged.  Things were average except the grits.  I thought the dried branches on the poinsettia on the wall by my table reflected the lack of attention to detail one would expect of a high end restaurant like Delmonico.  \n\nService was very good and the servers were friendly but I left feeling somewhat disappointed.  Well, at least there'll be no need to stop and peruse the menu anymore.	12	6	6	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

My husband and I both ordered ours medium-rare, the other pair ordered theirs medium.  When we received our steaks, they ended up giving everyone the wrong steaks.  The other couple seemed to have enjoyed our medium-rare steaks though!\n\nWe ended our dinner sharing 2 desserts, the banana creme pie and creme brulee - both were yummy.\n\nOutside of our mixed up orders, we will definitely be back.  Their steaks melt like butta!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	XwYcTqPIZgHwAPO70M6Ruw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Sure not rude however I felt like I just walked into Denny's at 2:30 am for some pancakes. The wait staff was prompt however I would have rather been served by Denny's. They not nice and unattentive. They made us feel like it was best if we just hurried finished our meal. Of course we occommidated them becuase once started eating the food was certainly good quality but way over salted. It was very pasty. Odds are unless someone else insists I wont be visting again. Why when there are so many other great choices. One more thing. The restaurant really had no theme.  White walls coupled with the staff it felt like an expensive hospital cafeteria.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	WFhv5pMJRDPWSyLnKiWFXA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
2JMNkEMI0UpyKTWEehJ-yA	3	2010-01-13 00:00:00	I really wanted to love this - I had very high expectations going in...unfortunatly, well, maybe I caught them on an off night..\n\nLet's start with the wine list - the night in question they were out of the slightly over $100 (inexpensive for the restaurant) bottle of Cab that I selected,  Not really a problem - found one that cost just a little more.  However, later in the meal one of the waiters informed me of another Cab (not on the list) that cost about the same as the one I originally selected but was much better than the one I ended up with. Why not inform me of this BEFORE I selected another bottle?  Strike one.\n\nIt was a Sunday night and I was informed that they were out of the special of the day - some sort of fish. Again not a problem as we came in for BEEF.  Just thought I would mention it...\n\nThe wedge salad - the bacon bits served with it were cold, greasy, and very tough.  Not good. The salad itself was fine - good blue cheese and nice and crisp- but for what you are paying the bacon should have been as well. Strike two.\n\nNow on to the steak.- the "signature" bone in rib eye. It was good. Very good in fact. - a huge cut cook just as I orded. But...it was kind of bland. Not totally lacking in flavor but still kind of bland.  Not bad, but not the best steak I had ever eaten.  My friend's filet was also very good - an excellent cut cooked as ordered but still a bit - shall we say?- unseasoned?  Call this half a strike.\n\nNow on to the pecan pie and ice cream thingy - yummy. Best part of the meal!\n\nAll in all, Emeril's Delmonico is not bad.  Just that I was expecting more...	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	LbtFyFzsdt-d2XDlIGVsaQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

However, the last visit in 2010 was a big disappointment. The food was just average and the service was terrible. My steak came to the table sans the melted butter and the server's solution was to bring a pat of butter several minutes later. There are too many outstanding restaurants for us to ever visit this restaurant again.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	MkyBX9POvI2wWUEAklVFYA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
2Sk-2jlmv0jj4RjGiGPbEw	4	2017-04-23 00:00:00	Ask ten local 'foodies' to name their favorite Las Vegas Steakhouse and it would be surprising if a single one said Delmonico, and even more shocking if any of them knew that Chef Ronnie Rainwater had been working in that kitchen ever since the restaurant was opened nearly eighteen years ago, yet with family in town and a love of Emeril Lagasse dating back to the earliest days of his expansion to Universal CityWalk it only seemed right to sit down for dinner at the oft-overlooked space in Venetian's RR, a Tasting Menu showing that not only has the restaurant not lost its fast-ball, but that it has learned a few new tricks as well\n\nSituated at the end of a string of eateries nearest Palazzo, Mario Batalli's B&B across the way soon to undergo renovations and places like DB, Pinot Brasserie and others come-and-gone since Lagasse chose to bring his New Orleans Steakhouse to Las Vegas in May of 1999, those visiting Delmonico Steakhouse will first notice the large bar previously tended by Max Solano as they approach the space before checking in at a hostess podium, reservations quickly confirmed as General Manager Tuan Tran keeps a watchful eye over an expanse that can easily seat hundreds, the space divided into four different rooms with the most quiet off to the left with the walls lined in Wine and glass\n\nHaving previously discussed a degustation with both Chef Rainwater and Emeril's Director of Operations Mike Olsen, a fixed price arrangement allowing the kitchen total control over a menu that would be delivered in five courses to highlight Spring, it was after brief greetings from the Chef and a trio of waiters that were a bit 'stiff' but still pleasant that the meal got started, all dishes presented with a comprehensive description from Ronnie with the majority served exactly as they are if ordered a la carte, save for the entrée course and a smorgasbord of Dessert\n\nAlways tempting fans by way of daily specials via Social Media, as though the menu of Creole riffs on traditional Steakhouse fare from a culinary legend is somehow not enough, it was with a few of Delmonico's signature Pop-Overs paired to creamy, whipped Butter that dinner got started alongside snacks including the longtime favorite Truffle and Parmesan Chips plus crisp Cracklins made from Kurobuta Pork, the kitchen remiss to waste any part of such an outstanding Animal that is also involved in several other plates offered throughout the menu\n\nStarting light and working towards heavier items, the second course presenting two specials including Deviled Eggs topped in a big hunk of King Crab and a spoonful of Caviar alongside Burrata tinged in Black Truffles with a vibrant Spring Pea Pesto on top, those looking for something a bit more hearty would be well served to order a warm Spinach Salad topped in Praline Bacon and an Egg that is first lightly poached and then fried crisp before being hemisected, the bright orange Yolk blending with Bacon Vinaigrette to form a coating to each leaf that is slick yet light and acidic.\n\nHaving already experienced many Delmonico classics during two prior visits, but always happy to see the thick Bone-In Bacon with Root Beer Glaze and Pickled Watermelon land on the table, two seasonal plates saw a thick steak of Grade A Duck Liver cooked to caramelizaion on the outside with its smooth center offset by a Hazelnut pastry something akin to Baklava plus sweetness added by Berries; the Rabbit Porchetta wrapped in Prosciutto opting to go all-in on savory with the lean meat carefully complimented by Mushrooms and Pea purée.\n\nGetting to the Meat of the menu...or more meatier at least...it was for course four that the kitchen decided to switch up presentations a bit from the typical plated Steaks in favor a large round block of Pork, Beef and side dishes, the Pork Chop about as tender as they get with two Bone-In Ribs showing the Kurobuta Pig in yet another way while the two cuts of Steak were good, but unfortunately not quite on the same level as Jean Georges or Carnevino in terms or richness or texture, the sides mostly forgettable even though others on the menu sounded more innovative while Ronnie's Chicken and Waffles that used to be only offered at lunch again proved to be the city's best-even better than the one offered by Yardbird down the way-thanks to the great Brine, shattering Skin and spicy Glaze.\n\nAt this point quite full, but assuming the best was yet to come, it was in two large plates decorated with Chocolate that the meal came to its finish, a total of eight different Desserts including a few not yet even listed with highlights coming from all angles, both the Lemon Bar and Key Lime Pie tangy yet rich atop their respective crusts while the Pecan Pie and Emeril's famous Banana Cream version remain indisputable classics, the German Chocolate Cake sadly a bit dry while the Butterscotch Pudding was the sort of thing that almost caused a fight as diners tried to decide who would get the last, creamy spoonful.	4	0	5	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Our head waiter was Michael and the manager on the floor was Vincent.   We also had at least two others who served us.  All were very professional and patient. Our party was not the eaisiest to serve that night, but what happens in Vegas...!\n\nObviously food tastes are very subjective.  My bone in ribeye and twice baked potato were great.  I did not care too much for the chicken and waffle dish my wife had... neither did she.  The shrimp appetizer was a 10, as was the crab dish.   The desserts... Creme Brulee, banana creme pie and chocolate cake were very good also.  Overall, a very nice experience.

So I think I've been to Delmonico six or seven times and the operative word is consistency. Always great service, always great food and just overall my favorite steakhouse.\n\nSo what isn't to like about Emeril's house of meat?\n\nA very well stocked bar, a nice wine list and perfectly cooked steaks.\n\nI started with the lettuce wedges with fresh blue cheese and got the rib eye. I don't know how they do it but the steaks always have this crispy, char on the outside but have a good juicy center with lots of flavor.\n\nWe shared the grits, corn and mushrooms as sides and they were tasty good.\n\nLike I said, this is a special occasion place and Delmonico has yet to disappoint. \n\nThanks Emeril for always making my trip to Vegas!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	PXbw--eK-Ot1g0dDH8X5SQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We've been meaning to go to Delmonico's for years since we are often in Las Vegas and always stay at the Palazzo.\n\nWe ate at the bar and watched some of the New Year's Eve college football game.  I think the volume was on the TV but we really couldn't hear it, hopefully other times they just have some music playing.\n\nI was kind of mixed on the food. The French Onion Soup is a must try! The broth was so deep and rich that you could taste the hours of preparation and simmering. The Tomato and Burrata dish was fine, as was the Ribeye Steak we ordered. Again, not bad, just ok when I compare them to their competitors in the hotel, like Carnavino or Bouchon where we often go for lunch.\n\nWe will have to try dinner next time but if you are going don't miss the onion soup!	2	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	0QdwQLVxZpgy9Qb2Qakflw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

3cnTdE45VrsS0o4cVhfGog	3	2017-02-12 00:00:00	Located inside my favorite hotel Venetian, Delmonico is one of Emeril's restaurant. When you walk in, the decor is very minimal but sophisticated with arched ceilings that makes you feel like you're inside a European gallery. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n-Deviled eggs: delicious! Very creamy, topped with King Crab meat is a plus.\n-truffle potato chips: good sharable appetizer. \n-New Orleans style barbecue shrimp: if you're into Cajun style barbecue shrimp, definitely order this dish. A bit different from the ones we had in New Orleans but still good. \n-Lobster bisque: has good amount of chunky Lobster meat, but not the best I've had. \n-ribeye: due to pregnancy, I had to order a well done steak. My steak came close to medium well, pink in the inside. I sent the steak back, it came back still not completely well done. Sent it back for the second time and the steak came back as beef jerky.. I expected at least the second time around for them to make a new one as I know the effect of cooking a piece of steak multiple times. Of course I wasn't expecting a well done steak to be juicy and tender but I have had a properly cooked well done steak before that's was not super tough! Flavor on the steak was pretty good, but could not taste the dry aged flavor as much. In the end, the restaurant took this off the bill, which was a nice gesture. \n-sides: Creamy corn (very good), mushrooms (a bit salty but good flavor), twice baked potatoes (good). \n\nOverall, I would give this restaurant 3 and a half stars.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	rOIrilMC7VFwFVBeQNiKMw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
3HjlXkG4WA8YpMFeDp-L1A	4	2010-12-22 00:00:00	Definitely a fan of this place. Reminds me of a cross between my local favorites Ruth Chris in Irvine, Ca & Mortons in Santa Ana, Ca. Great service of course, awesome wine selection. Came her for my 40th & knew I was going to have steak so I went with their bone in ribeye & it was definitely not a mistake, no steak sauce necessary & never should need it at a good steak house. I'm never partial to chicken at more expensive places (I just don't see the point, may as well go all out & get the beef) but my wife had their roasted chicken & I had a taste of it & it was the most flavorful chicken dish I've ever had. I may just have to go against my favorites & get that the next time. All in all this place should be a 5 star but I've only been there once, I may adjust once I go back again in the new year.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	NKgUbFFUAaN-B87vC3HggQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I was so upset I didn't even bother to order dessert.  I thought if dessert tastes anything like dinner, I'm not going to bother. Noone bothered to ask how the food was. The chef didn't bother to come to our table,  even though he spoke to individuals at the three other tables surrounding us. Thank God I opted for the indoor gondola ride after dinner which helped to improve my mood for the evening.  I won't be back here or to any of his restaurants. I'm a good person so I still left a very generous tip;  after all it wasn't the waiter's fault the food was just ok.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	QtHv6STU4sddCPOBXEYTaA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

This is a huge slab of meat and I had a hard time finishing all 18 ounces of it.  The only reason why I didn't give this place a 5 was because of house expensive it is.

3PjT8n8rpkwLRuObXLmm3w	2	2011-03-31 00:00:00	We went in with high hopes after a friend recommended Delmonico but we left just a bit disappointed.  The ambiance was really nice and we were given a great table without a reservation but the food left a little to be desired.  \n\nMy friend and I both started with lobster bisque, which was good but a little thin.  We noticed right away too that she had 2 tiny little pieces of lobster in hers, but I had almost an entire small claw.  I was happy until I realized it was tough and rubbery.  I actually had to use a knife and fork to cut it into bite sized pieces.  My husband ordered the wedge salad as a starter and it was 80% white/yellow core.  Not what you would expect in a place as pricey as this.\n\nI ordered the fillet and it was cooked perfectly but it was not a great cut of meat.  Maybe I have high standards, but I think a $30+ fillet should be butter knife soft, but this one was kind of fibrous and hard to cut with a steak knife.  I didn't really care for the seasoning either, but that's a personal preference, not something I can count against the restaurant.  My husband's rib eye was really fatty but he loved his twice baked potato.  I had the corn gratin for my side and it was tasty but again, not my style.  \n\nOur server was efficient but pretty standoffish.  When we first sat down, we ordered a bottle of "Emerel's Blend" wine and he nicely suggested that we might want to try something else, but other than that, his interaction with us was a bit cold.  \n\nMaybe it was an off night, but I really expected more from a $400+ dinner.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	96aWRa-gy1RrsrFQURagvg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
3rz3oWiqgwCdyTt-Jpjrew	3	2008-10-04 00:00:00	The Gist:   The most expensive steak does NOT equal the best tasting steak.     \n\nPlayed in Vegas with a group of 8 other friends.  Even though there is so much good food to choose from in Vegas, all of us knew we wanted to go to a nice place for some good steak during our stay.    We've heard a lot of good things about Delmonico so it was pretty easy decision to try it out.   \n\nFirst things first.  Service was great.   We came late for our reservation.  No problem.   Some of us actually shared a couple steaks.  No problem.   Took pictures for us during a busy Saturday night.  No problem.\n\nThe important thing - the steak.   With 8 people around the table we were able to try various cuts.   Several guys got the bone-in rib eye.   One of the girls got the rib-eye, and I personally shared the new york strip with a friend.    I feel like I'm paying a premium for Vegas and/or Emeril.     Don't get me wrong, you'll definitely get a nice fat, juicy, flavorful steak here.     But I felt like I was getting more of my money's worth with the Kona Crusted Steak at Capital Grille (Chicago) or the Cowboy Cut at Taste of Texas (Houston).    The meat quality was much better and believe it or not, much more flavorful than Delmonico's steaks.\n\nThat being said, if you do go to Dominico's, definitely get the sautee'd mushrooms on the side.   Its a nice garlicky mix of mushrooms that compliments perfectly with the steaks!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	v6vLkcotT_DEDRGDya9r6Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Could have ate like 5 orders of them they were so good. I ordered wagyu fillet. Best steak I have. Flavor amazing, melted in your mouth and was just insanely good. Bf got the strip I think...? Or ribeye haha don't remember but whatever it was it was great too. We had twice baked potatoes, great. And the duck egg crème brûlée, great except the sugar was a little too hard and tasted a little burnt in spots but that's the only complaint. The service was beyond amazing too.

3_qPh42uXAHVEb2lKInwBg	1	2016-08-26 00:00:00	Wow...was super disappointed by my dinner here. A buddy said he had the best steak in his life here, but unfortunately that wasn't anything close to my experience. Everything we had was sort of meh...\n\nStarted with french onion soup...steakhouse staple right? Wrong...it didn't have much flavor and was pretty one dimensional. Limp, flaccid, no flavor onions.\n\nMy steak...prime, dry-aged rib-eye on the bone. After being schooled by the waiter on how "they cook their steaks" and what medium rare means. I get a medium well steak instead of the medium rare that i ordered. What a waste of a good piece of meat or at least I assume it was before they over-cooked it.\n\nCreamed spinach - another steakhouse classic they can't screw up right? It's got this weird taste and texture, not sure what it was, but didn't even eat half of it.\n\nVery disappointing, really not worth the $$$ or even the time unforuntately.

I went there as just one person and was seated in a booth by myself and was still given excellent service and attention as I would expect. I was expertly consulted by a sommelier on my wine choices to go with my $50 filet that was cooked to a perfect medium rare. All in all I had a $120 five course meal with two glasses of wine. Some may think outrageous, but hey its Vegas and I didn't have a problem splurging a little bit.

There was a group at the table next to us and he seemed much more attentive to them. \n\nAnother waiter came over at the end of our dinner and we asked what spice was used in the waffle- he said he didn't know. I then asked where The Dorsey was in proximity to the restaurant, he said- again, I don't know........ he didn't even attempt to answer our questions.

Not only was the food perfect but the service was phenomenal. My friends and I popped in off the street with no reservation and not dressed up at all. Even though we completely stood out, we were shown to out seats immediately and we didn't get one dirty look from any of our 3 waiters!  I will return to vegas in the future if only to eat here again!!!!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	egen1SHotjZspnv2z2ETbw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
45l-lWw3N9uyjmlK4hLq0w	5	2015-05-21 00:00:00	My first review on yelp. Only reason I'm doing this review is because of Delmonico's Steakhouse at The Venetian. We were tired of the average buffets and fast food and we really wanted to have a fancy night. So we looked up on yelp for a nice fancy restaurant. We decided on Delmonico's and called in to make reservations for two at 530. Came 530, we were still at the pool, so we called in and pushed the reservation to 630. Staff accommodated us, which was surprising. We came to restaurant at 630 and were seated immediately. The staff are on the dot with their reservations. Right after we were seated, the waiter asked what we would like to drink. I ordered a usual neat Johnny Walker Black Label and followed it with a 7&7. I believe every man should learn to love whiskey. My lady ordered a water lol. We then looked at the menu. I read all the reviews on yelp and just jumped straight to the assortment of steaks they had available. My lady ordered a New York T Bone Steak and I had the filet mignon. We also ordered the Butternut squash ravioli for the appetizer and mashed potatoes to eat with the steaks. \n\nFirst came ravioli. It was 5 pieces of ravioli. My first thought was,"Damn I'm getting jipped out of 15 bucks" But when I bit into the first piece of ravioli, I literally had an mouth orgasm... No homo. It was the best ravioli I ever had in my life. Hands down. I wish I had a whole plate full of it. My lady was hella impressed as well. \n\nThen came out the steaks. I hade mine cooked medium rare and she had hers done medium. The first bite was the best. Succulent, tender, easy to chew. Best steak I ever had in my life.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Xu0qWwsoORyXCwo1Re_oeQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
46g-ED1NUMqKSXYTYg2lAg	3	2013-03-29 00:00:00	Went for lunch waited almost five minutes for any type of service (was not busy). Ordered appetizers chips and gumbo they were very good. Then the\n bad. We ordered two burgers one medium one medium well. Both came medium rare at best. Sent them back, they put the burgers back on the grill. Came back mine was supposed to be medium well was medium. My wife's was supposed to be medium was medium rare. Both came back on blood soaked buns WOW.  We were disappointed. It did get better the pecan pie with ice cream was very good.  Also our server was very nice once he came to the table. So for the poor burger and blood soaked bun I have to give three stars.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	c4jMZc1vA_A-BrseDiw0vQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
48Sz4DMaBchoQZpSBfqR2Q	4	2010-04-30 00:00:00	Thinking of what to say, I find it's hard to stay on track and remember that I'm reviewing a meat 'n potatoes steakhouse that doesn't go out of it's way to be too fancy or adventurous, it just strives to make good food in a nice environment. \n\nI think a little is lost if you forget Chef Emeril's philosophy; watch him on TV, the guy just likes good food.  Remember Erik, you didn't eat at Bouchon or French Laundry... you didn't go on a magical food adventure.  You had a steak.  A damned good steak.\n\nThe ambiance is nice; dimly-lit, full-service, white-linen business casual kind of place.  The wife and I had good, attentive service, and our head waiter was a treat.  He was incredibly accommodating and helpful.  I had fun listening to him give the table next to us tips on eating in Vegas, steering that couple away from Tao ("A nightclub that happens to serve food.") and Cut ("Way too salty and LA pretentious for my taste.  Maybe they've toned it down... the salt, anyway.")\n\nWe started out with two appetizers, as we usually do, our favorite Emeril's New Orleans BBQ shrimp with petite rosemary biscuit, and to get into the steakhouse mood, the wonderful truffle and parmesan potato chips.\n\nMy wife had the filet mignon medallions crusted in mushrooms with a pan sauce, don't remember of what, and I had the 9 oz. filet mignon with a small pad of maitre'd butter, cooked to a warm, pink, bloody center.\n\nBoth were EXCELLENT.  For dessert, we capped our meal, and ourselves off with Emeril's banana cream pie and the pecan pie.  I had a single jamaican blue mountain courtesy of cafes richard.  \n\nThe food was excellent, service was spot-on, and atmosphere was great, if a tad noisy.  Unfortunately, the authentic Kobe filet I had at Fish House spoiled me on steaks forever, so as good as Delmonico is, I can only muster 4 stars.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	sKWywtDD9teU1M_c-UnMkQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
48vtgYE9xmQEWSysOq497g	5	2009-03-24 00:00:00	This was my third time at an Emeril restaurant, and once again I left feeling that paying $85 to eat dinner was perfectly justified.\n\nAppetizer: The traditional New Orleans gumbo.  Smokey, spicy, warm, and comforting.  \n\nEntree: Filet mignon, medium.  Crusted with just the right amount of spices, cooked to perfection, and crowned with a healthy pat of herb butter.  \n\nSide Dish: Country smashed potatoes.  Clearly filled with more butter and cream than I care to think about, skins left in (love that), and just melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  \n\nMy friend's side dish: Bacon & cheese grits.  I normally don't like grits, but these were nice and well...gritty, not runny or gloppy.  Add bacon and cheese...c'mon.   \n\nDessert: The best part of the meal.  Wait--probably the best part of my entire Vegas trip.  Warm pecan pie with an oatmeal shortbread cookie crust, topped with homemade vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce.  Just...wow.  The pecans were chopped into manageable pieces, the filling was not overly thick and cloying, and I could have eaten the crust by itself and been happy.  I had a taste of my friend's chocolate bread pudding, which was gooey and intensely chocolatey, but not too sweet.  (It tasted like a combo of semi-sweet & bittersweet.)\n\nDrinks: Pretty good.  They don't have a specialty cocktail list since they are very into being a traditional steakhouse, but my pineapple martini was nice.  \n\nDecor: Very bare bones- the plain beige walls have no art on them, but that allows you to notice the very ornate architecture of the place, with high ceilings and arches everywhere.  I was too into my food to really care what it looked like though.\n\nService: As always with Emeril's restaurants- impeccable.  We had no less than 3 people taking care of us at all times: one to take our orders, one to bring our food, and one to take it away.  \n\nTip: SHARE an entree.  I split the 9.5 oz. filet mignon with my friend and I'm glad I did.  The average portion is enough for 2 or 3 people.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	HaqStKX7oqpx5ymDHE58Ow	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
4bQrVUiRZ642odcKCS0OhQ	2	2016-02-08 00:00:00	If you're looking for craptastic service and mediocre food at caviar prices, check out the Delmonico inside the Venetian!\n\nIt started with the cocktail waitress who was so sassy it became bitchy, snipping short responses when our client asked a question. Then came our dinner server who was borderline rude. "Are your seafood options listed here the only meat-free options you have? Most of them have sausage or some sort of meat in them," I inquired. "Yep," was all he said before moving on... didn't even offer to remove an ingredient or help me out in any way.\n\nThe food was pretty tasteless. An heirloom tomato salad had the most bang for the appetizer buck, but at $18 for four slices of tomato and a splooge of burrata, I could concoct a very similar version from my local farmer's market for a fraction of the price. And it's not that price is that huge of a factor here; if you're going to Delmonico you are aware of the beefy tab that will come at the end of your meal... but when the service spits you aside, it's not worth it.\n\nIf you're wondering why two stars and not one - the second star is for the wine list, which shone brighter than the boring white walls inside this sub-standard steak joint.	2	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	rCTVWx_Tws2jWi-K89iEyw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
4D11dlhQ5xfbwiUY-_6xFg	3	2008-04-03 00:00:00	Surprisingly very mediocre, considering I had heard such fantastic things.\n\nThere are many things that could be talked about, but at a steakhouse like this everything should be coming back to the hunk of dry-aged beef in front of your face. It should be flavorful, seared to just a tad crisp on the outside, and it should be consistent.\n\nMy steak was almost reasonable. My buddy's steak next to me (same cut) was left half-finished on the plate (overcooked and just generally not awesome).\n\nThe ambience and service was great, but if you can't get the steak right...	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	y3iV1om4K1aw7cD40hx0jQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Since we sat next to a cleaning station. Not impressed. Wanted something equivalent to mastros but it wasn't even remotely close. It just looks nice but tasted... Mediocre. The ribeye would of been better if I made it myself. They were seriously off their game.. Was hoping to be "wowed" but I definitely had better.. This isn't a must have.

4PRbNWjm_7c-BrauLpBm5Q	3	2015-06-09 00:00:00	Perhaps my expectations were too high.\nLet me start off by saying, the hype about their 16 oz Bone-in Ribeye ($52) is well deserved.  It's flavorful, has exquisite marbling, and served at a medium rare perfection.\n\nBut that's where the hype ends.  Sure, the lobster bisque is good and the shrimp appetizer is tasty, but for what we paid overall, I know there are better options here in the city.  \n\nSo, I would say to you -- go for their Bone-in Ribeye and leave all other expectations behind.  It's a great meal, just didn't make it to my list of favorites.	2	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	MspXtBLBkKJwEyfJ79YYJw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
4q1kD-duYcxsjC8loiRsBw	4	2016-01-09 00:00:00	I've been to this location twice over the years.  This is located in Palazzo in the walkway towards the venetian.  Both times i ordered the bone-in rib eye, and both times it was pretty good.  This latest time i ordered Medium-Rare, but it was definitely more on the medium side.  I should have been more upset it wasn't cooked exactly how i wanted it, but it was still good.  \n\nFor dessert, i was pretty excited to try the Banana Cream Pie, but it was pretty average.  It had  A LOT of bananas and didn't really blow me away with flavor.   It was like eating a big banana with whip cream.  I probably wouldn't get it again.  \n\nThe service was pretty good, but i wish they didn't sit us right next to the kitchen entrance.  It gets annoying to have people constantly walking by you with food and dishes.	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ymSVFNfDzSVedxOuASOHXA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
4rdQe8sI1wmj4MG4wiCrGw	2	2012-11-22 00:00:00	I recently stayed two nights in Vegas. I went to B&B one night and Delmonico the second. The food was excellent quality at both places. But the service and the atmosphere fell very short at Delmonico's. I was dining alone so maybe the server didn't think he needed to attend to me but the night before I had amazing service at B&B so I had an expectation of what a $100 dining experience should be like. \n\nI told the server I would like a glass of red wine when my steak was delivered. I waited ten minutes before it was brought out. I used to wait tables... for a decade. I'm a reasonable patron. I think fine dining demands something above diner level service.\n\nSo despite a delicious steak and a tasty martini, the rowdy classless crowd and the crappy service will keep me from coming back.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	oC-7VXIy5aBwDZ6-rBPYIw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Some of the best steaks you will ever have. There has been nothing ive had here that has been short of excellent.

4_QGhAMtBSwfL8wmfu1n2g	5	2008-04-09 00:00:00	Superb!\n\nI'm sure people can knock off stars if their steaks didn't come out to their liking (heck I would too), but all four of ours came out exactly as we wanted them to.\n\nI'm not a big fan of Ermiril's show, nor am I a fan of his personality.  Despite having his name associated with this restaurant, I feel that if he's not the one cooking my meal, then it's not really his food.  Whoever the chef was that night sure had his mojo going that's for sure.\n\nThe cocktail shrimp appetizer was amazing.  Cocktail shrimp you say?  How different can that be from Bellagio's buffet where you can get like 1000 in one sitting if you wanted?  Well considering you're saving your stomach for more desirable substances, the dish contained eight snicker bar sized prawns drizzled with a fine cocktail sauce that had a nice kick to it.  It was more than enough to satiate us before the main course.\n\nWhen our meat came out, my buddy and I couldn't stop drooling.  The girls had to laugh as their softball sized fillet's looked more like golf balls in comparison to our full-sized cow bone-in Rib-Eyes.  Literally the size of the plate itself, and at least 1.5 inches thick....Vegans would run in fear at the sheer size of this holy beast.  The rib eyes were cooked perfectly throughout.  Medium-rare, a beautiful mix of pink and red with a perfectly charred (requested) exterior that seared all the juices in and added wonderful flavor to the aged meat.  If this wasn't a proper meal we would've gone to town on the bones like cavemen at the end.  Truly magnificent.  And to think, they were offering a "Generous Cut" Porterhouse on the menu as well.....that might have been size of.....two cows (40-50 ounces per what our waiter quoted)\n\nThe sides were just as delightful.  Served family style, the Asparagus was grilled perfectly, the potato fingerlings roasted with a beautiful blend of butter and garlic, and the mushroom medley was bursting with flavor.  I will also add that the dinner rolls are probably some of the best I've ever had.  Soft and fresh hot out of the oven, they had a nice sweetness to them and the fresh churned butter added an exquisite country taste as well.\n\nDessert consisted of an excellent bread pudding with a scoop or Oreo ice cream, along with a Banana Fosters cream pie.  Both were amazingly good.  I have no idea how we stomached them, but they were a nice finishing touch.\n\nThe wine list is extensive and amazing.  They're one of the few restaurants in Vegas that serve one of my favorite wineries wine (Neal).  We had an absolutely dazzling bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, that we had to order another.  Needless to say, both gentleman slugged down 75% of a bottle each.  : )\n\nThe service was excellent.  our waiter was attentive at all times and was very alert to our needs.  The best waiters are those that know what you want without even having to signal or tell them, and our waiter was just that good.\n\nA very elegant setting and located in the walkway connecting the Palazo and Venetian, this is definitely one of the steakhouses in Vegas I will frequent again.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	e03iPZLuSJ5_3LY4TOp2iQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The cuts were thick yet so soft when you eat them.  Hats off to their chefs.  The steak were done so perfect you really don't need to dip the meat in sauce or butter, etc.  It's so flavorful as is.  Pricey?  Yes very.  Which is the only reason that might keep me from frequenting this restaurant as much as I would like to.  I don't think they have a dress code.  But, I would recommend dressing up a bit when you go here.  Otherwise you would stand out and be embarrass like I was one time.

51EvJcLixkj7Y5liZ114NA	2	2009-08-11 00:00:00	Delmonico in Las Vegas by Emeril Lagasse is not as impressive as I would expect it would be. First we are given a really lousy table in the corner as if my husband has been very bad that he deserve to be punished in the corner(considering this is his special day-b-day). Waiters are clueless, they are just standing in the middle but most of the time really doing nothing that in few ocassions I have to pour my own wine in my glass. The head waiter is the only one who seems to be working and who do know what to do here.\n            We are given a small apetizer courtesy of the chef bec of my husbands b-day which is a good touch, I love this little appetizer (not in the menu, wish it was there because that would be the only highlight of the evening) a concoction of smoke chicken with couscous with a little spices, the taste is all balance and in harmony.\n           The fried green tomatoes appetizer is bland, whatever coating and sauce they put in there didnt help at all.  The spinach and raddichio salad is soaked on its own dressing which you cannot even tell which dressing it is, salads when presented are supposed to be crisp, so make sure you only put the dressing when it is ready to be eaten, very disappointing since the head weater gladly recommended this dish.\n          My husband ordered Bone in Ribeye Steak, huge, cooked perfect but no taste or seasoning at all, it would need some sort of sauce to make it appetizing.  Filet mignon is OK, just like any other filet mignon, nothing great about it.\n         Luckily there's one dish that is worth mentioning, the potato gratin dauphineous, excellent, potato perfectly cooked, not much cream, hint of garlic and toasty top, excellent!\n        Going back? No way, very expensive and I'm not happy.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	fikN6yS3M_EU7ZA2VuVHsQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

It was my friend's birthday dinner and she is a huge meat eater, I on the other hand don't actually like steak all that much, but WOW! It is absolutely impossible not to enjoy your meal here. \n\nWe were in a rush because we had tickets to a show and we were already running late. We advised our maitre d' that we had barely one hour to eat dinner and be on our way. He went above and beyond to make sure we got service fast and made the show on time. Not only was he absolutely efficient in making sure our food came out quickly, but he was also super friendly and attentive with us. \n\nOur cocktails took no time at all to arrive and were done perfectly. We didn't have time to get appetizers which was a big disappointment, so we went straight for the main course. I had the rib eye and smashed potatoes, my friend had the fillet Mignon and fingerling potatoes, and we also shared some buttered asparagus. All the food was top notch and delicious. My rib eye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and was well seared on the outside. Like I said, I don't particularly like steak but this was mind blowing amazing! I had a few bites of my friend's fillet Mignon and it was melt in your mouth goodness. I don't know that it could be possible, but it was even better than my rib eye. Amazing. \n\nThe sides were also very good, specially the country smashed potatoes which were buttery and creamy. They had bacon and what I think were leeks in them. Yum. The asparagus were cooked to perfection and seasoned just right. I did not try the fingerling but my friend said she wasn't overly impressed by them. \n\nMy friend was also surprised with an apple cider sorbet and a candle - for her birthday. The sorbet was delicious, light and refreshing. All in all our visit to Delmonico was fantastic and worth every single dollar we paid. Dinner here is pricey, but seriously if you find yourself in Las Vegas, you'd be crazy not to come here!	2	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	_W9N0kF0qERB3deAcDISLg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
5ED640-83V_8BuXGjDoAJQ	3	2017-04-08 00:00:00	The steaks were very moist and tasty.  The service was not the best.  It was early in the evening and the place was not packed so to wait for 20 minutes for a steak seams a little too long.  Either way, that evened out to being about average for a place that was pretty expensive price point.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2zX_qQUGocOdbFL-k8U0VA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
5ERxHo0Xltr2dQ_nOolF8A	5	2014-01-30 00:00:00	Had dinner reservations at 6:30pm and we were seated right away.\n\nI looked at their menu prior to stepping foot into the restaurant so I kind of had an idea of what I would like to order.\n\nFor our appetizer, we ordered two Parmesan and Garlic potato chips. I'm a chip queen....obsessed and in love with chips but this....this didn't taste that great. =/ The first five chips were good...but after awhile...it tasted WAY TOO GREASY. You know that over greased taste? Yeah...that's what I was starting to taste. It felt like they drenched the entire thing in oil and left it there for days. My party finished the first plate of that but we just couldn't finish the second plate. I definitely would NOT order this again. \n\nNEW ORLEANS GUMBO: This gumbo had rice, chicken, sausage and veggies. Pretty good sized portion for a bowl of soup. Small eaters would be half full from this. Seriously...lol. I thought to myself...damn...I hope I have enough room in my stomach for my entree!!!\n\nCAESAR SALAD: Typical normal Caesar. It's big enough to share with your entire party.\n\nBONELESS RIB-EYE: You have your choice on the menu for bone-in OR boneless rib eye. I was with a fancy date and his party of four other high rollers so I didn't wanna make a mess, that's why I opted for boneless. I've got to admit...it was good...but to be technical, I would rate it at a solid B grade. My rib eye was cooked to my liking, the flavoring was delicious BUT......there were more fatty parts that I would like. =/ eh...not a big fan. But it didn't take away from the complete meal. Great rib eye...big enough for leftovers the next day.\n\nNOTE: Three out of the six steak entrees my party ordered was over cooked. Someone wanted medium rare but her steak came out medium. My date ordered medium and it pretty much came out medium well.\n\nFor our side dishes we ordered potatoes au gratin, asparagus, mashed potatoes, and another veggie dish.\n\nCan't go wrong with Delmonicos. Def give it a try! Be sure to make reservations.	2	1	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I got the fillet medallions.  I found the sauce and crust to be slightly too overpowering on the fillet, but it was still very good.  Our waiter, Frank, was very personable and made us feel right at home.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	B_GMOc3Bi6sw4ATZKnlK5g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
5Im_64tPce7troYcJQv_Qw	3	2017-07-10 00:00:00	We recently came here for our second time for our anniversary. We were craving a seafood tower and we had liked this place before and we were in the Venetian. \n\nWe sat in the bar and had a wonderful server. Very personable, accommodating and very nice. The atmosphere is still the same great upbeat, fun and relaxing (yes all at the same time). The drinks were good as well.\n\nThe thing that lacked was the seafood tower. The highlight of the meal, the thing we were looking forward to the most, what we were drooling for. A couple of the dipping sauces were delicious but their substitute for cocktail sauce tasted like marinara sauce. Overly sweet and not a good mix with shrimp. Maybe I am biased because I love the kick of horseradish in my cocktail sauce. The biggest complaint though, was the seafood felt dry or freezer burned. We still ate it because I wasn't going to let them waste the food and was in too much of a good mood to complain, but for the $, maybe I should have. \n\nSo this trip was a love hate. We got way better service but the food lacked and isn't that what should rock my world at a restaurant of this caliber?	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	d7mGRuYwaXtt8UgYFyfW-A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

There was so much flavor in it and i havent tasted a steak like this in a lonnng time.  It was really cooked to perfection the way it was cooked.... words cannot even describe.  I wished I could have steaks like this more often. \n\nThe waiters were also so nice.

5ns6C4vLbr2tVMDuZjl8sA	5	2014-01-20 00:00:00	You're in Vegas what else do you expect but excellent cuisine from a world famous Emeril restaurant? Yes this place is on the pricier side, yes the portions are huge, and yes its an upscale place. But you pay to play in Vegas so that is exactly what you receive here. The service was nothing but superb! It didn't matter if you're a big wig celeb, or just a family for wkend trip they treated every patron with the exact same excellent service. \n\nThe menu is pretty much full of steaks or some selections of pasta and seafood. Pretty much all items are ordered Al a carte in addition to your entree selection. The majority of us had the highly recommended bone in rib eye. OMG you will know with your first bite why this aged piece of steak is $52! It literally melts like butter in your mouth! The seasoning was spot on with that perfect caramelized crust. I would definitely recommend the rib eye if this is your first time here! \n\nThe must have side dish is the Creamed Corn Gratinee: This has the consistency of cream of corn yet has the crusty top of your usual gratins. It's has a delicious sweet yet savory flavor profile that just makes you wanna come back for seconds. The only negative is its $11 for that little dish. But again you pay for the quality instead of quantity here.\n\nThe next must have dessert is the banana cream pie! It's quite literally 8 layers of banana slices staked high! This reminds you exactly of what a banana cream pie your grandma used to make at home tastes!  This is quite the perfect way to finish off your meal or share with a date/friends. \n\nWe will definitely be visiting again on your next Vegas trip. But yes you'll need to save up for this one as your wallet may cry once you see the bill!	5	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	RS4AjuF4glgClCkdgD4nDA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Then I had the lobster bisque soup. This soup was fantastic! I love lobster bisque and this was by far the best bisque I have ever had! For the main course I had the filet minion crusted in wild mushroom bacon and topped with parmesean. OH My GOD! It just melted in my mouth. The service was amazing, the food was fantastic.

5wcxVZzbzx7lON97KK-oaw	5	2015-12-03 00:00:00	So my buddies wanted to go to a legit steakhouse in Vegas and we decided to try Delmonico.  We shared the seafood platter for an appetizer and how can you go wrong with king crab, oysters, and lobster.  I ordered the gumbo and it was delicious and full of depth and flavor.  The star of this dinner was the bone in Ribeye!  Perfectly charred on the outside and so tender and moist in the inside.  Best piece of steak I have had in my life, so far. Lol  I'm not a fan of fat on steak but the fat on this steak melted in my mouth and was as close to steak butter as there is.  My friends ordered sides but the steak was so big I didn't have room for anything else.  I think we ordered to much food and we had lots of leftovers. I could have shared the steak and I would have felt perfect.  This place is expensive but worth every penny.  If you feel like treating yourself this is a great place to eat.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	JggYB6OGLq218pE-VIkIiQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Their steaks are so much more flavorful, tender, juicy and just cooked perfectly.  We've tried many hyped up ones but they fail to meet our expectations. with Demonico, we were not disappointed at all. \n\nthis is off topic but since we are talking about steakhouses, stay away from "the cut" restaurant at palazzo, not good, not worth it. see my review on it if you need to.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Dfukqmw4z1VvhCg9ts_o4Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Large portion perfectly med rare, but too "saucy" (not sure why they feel butter is necessary on such a flavorful cut that should be able to stand on its own.)  Truthfully, I've had better ribeye on our backyard grill.\n\nLamb.  Overcooked and also too saucy.  Not sure what that flavorless choux puff was about...\n\nTook two bottles of wine, but only got charged 1 corkage.  Nice.\n\nIf I ever go back - which I doubt I will - I'll stick to the non meat items.

We were seated right away. \n\nThree servers were helping us, and they were very attentive throughout the night. \n\nOur meal started off with complimentary bread. It kind of reminded me of yorkshire pudding. It was really light and airy. I liked it because it didn't make me as full. \n\nBoth of us ordered the bone-in rib eye cooked medium rare. It was cooked nicely, and it had nice flavors. I didn't realize it while I was eating, but the steak was really salty. I couldn't stop drinking water all night. We also ordered the wild mushroom side dish. This can definitely use less salt. To end our meal, our server gave us a birthday dessert- blueberry sorbet. Because we were so full, we ordered the banana cream pie togo. It was boxed nicely and I was able to enjoy this dessert later that night. It was delicious, but if you don't like bananas, don't get it. \n\nIt was an overall pleasant dining experience. I would definitely come back and try other dishes.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	T4rXSHtNUOA47GXS63S6mg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

6eUT3IwwWPP3CZkAhxqOIw	5	2016-09-25 00:00:00	One word my friends: tableside!!! Yes, tableside carving of your steak chateaubriand for two/Creekstone farm steaks never disappoints. One of the best dinners I had this year for sure.  I would recommend Delmonico restaurant in Vegas who ever goes to Vegas or lives there.  \n\nDelmonico is settled within the Venetian hotel and with a 5 pm dinner reservation , they were pretty busy by 6 pm. I'm assuming people want to eat good streak before different shows and other entertainment in Vegas. Service was impeccable with the server and assistant both working harmoniously together.  The restaurant is not overly pretentious or glamorous looking.  I liked the overall atmosphere with the white walls/crisp white tablecloths on the tables with dim lighting.  \n\nThe service starts with the complimentary brioche bread and butter which were decadently heavenly.  Then they entice and educate you about their wine list etc but I don't drink so I was ready to order some steak, steak, steak! I did the chateaubriand steak for two carved for us.  It was a 18oz steak but really my 9 oz share was big but so yummy so yes I was able to finish my portion.  The garlic smashed potatoes were delicious.  The creamed spinach was just ok, a bit of a let down.  \nOther than that I enjoyed every minute of my dinner before my red eye flight back to Florida.	56	30	52	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	7RlyCglsIzhBn081inwvcg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I swear my starry eyes didn't affect the taste, it was incredible on its own. \n\nStarted with delicious Krug champagne and oysters. I really appreciated quality oysters after having some sub-par ones the night before at a buffet. \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque and I should have too. I ended up having a bit of his, it is NOT to be missed. We almost put in another order. \n\nI ordered the filet and he the bone-in ribeye. Both were delicious, and even though they are famous for the ribeye I liked the filet more. It was so lean and tender, cooked perfectly medium rare, but it was that charring on the outside that gave it this incredible flavor. The ribeye was fantastic too, it had a completely different flavor. My man preferred his ribeye so it worked perfectly. Honestly can't say a bad thing about either. \n\nThey sent us a house mad sherbet to celebrate our engagement, and we finished with divine espresso. \n\nMy fiancé and I agree this was the most delicious and flawless meal we have shared. We will definitely return every time we come to Vegas.	2	0	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	W5h7Ja_3RwcpSBEC1iWK2Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
6gP4H1CD7kjCaQLwuh-EgA	3	2007-07-11 00:00:00	We started out with a cheese and prime rib fondue with pretzels which was outstanding.  The portion seemed small, but was very filling for an appetizer.  \n\nI ordered the NY Strip and ordered the potato cakes with onions as a side.  The steak was nicely cooked but really lacked flavor.  The best part of the meal was the potato cakes with onions.  I honestly was hoping for a little more BAM.\n\nDessert was a disappointment for me.  I ordered the chocolate cake and it was more like a fudge.  I only ate a few bites.  My wife loved her dessert, I just can't remember what she got!  \n\nService was ok... but seeing the service other people got made us realize it was probably just our waitstaff that was lacking.  Other tables actually heard the specials and their waiter made suggestions.  They received sauces with their steaks, we did not.  When I asked our waiter for a dessert recommendation, he basically read the menu.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	6GMMaIMOIQQO4eKaAOa3mA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

6mbyMvge3rQ_mYRzDaxtjg	5	2015-01-19 00:00:00	This absolutely by far is my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas. I went here again on my 29th birthday, and the service was amazing as always. I ordered the ribeye to share along with the best lobster bisque you will ever have. Also the truffle potato chips are to die for. The restaurant is very classy and a bit pricey, however, you get what you pay for. I've tried pretty much all of the restaurants at the Venetian, and I have to stay this one is my absolute favorite. The steaks come out a perfect medium rare cooked to perfection in butter.\n\nSince this is a popular restaurant, I highly recommend making a reservation in advance.

6MLYe1Ndg83MkT6ZMcg4qw	5	2008-08-05 00:00:00	The best choice for steaks in Las Vegas.  The staff are expert servers.  I have gone here for both intimate dinners and group dining, and all experiences have been beyond our expectations.  Start with the truffled parmesan chips, then the tomato salad, the mushrooms, the filet (black and blue of course), one of the potato specials, and stay for dessert (they sell cigars in the bar) and a glass of scotch to finish off the meal.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ZWwbq4f11hYO3TI0-n5NbQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
6PJeznO5MNatvvV343lU0Q	2	2014-08-10 00:00:00	I would give Delmonico a 2.5 or even more if it was available but as it's 2 or 3 unfortunately for them I have to go with 2. There were so many pluses for the meal that I feel bad about rating the restaurant low. However, the overall experience was not what I wanted, and for a  meal of this price I have pretty achievable expectations.\n\nFor starters, the sevice was immaculate and I mean truly immaculate, the servers work as a team and they we're amazing. From recommending wines to full descriptions of food, and even drinks, they were aces. The wine list had so many rare and amazing finds that you could get lost searching, thankfully the staff was able to help us pick out one perfect for our tastes and meal. For the appetizer, bone in bacon, we'll if you didn't think it would be absolutely amazing by the name I can promise you, words do not describe how amazing this appetizer is. It truly is memorizing. Try it, and you'll understand. \n\nFor dinner I had a filet and he had a bone in ribeye, their signature cut. Unfortunately  my husband had to send his steak back due to being substantially overlooked. Again, the waitstaff immediately addressed the issue and apologized agreeing with my husband that not only was the steak overlooked, but it was substantially overlooked, ie, the steak was ordered medium rare and came out between medium well and well.\n\nThe waitstaff removed the steak from the table and after a few minutes brought my husband a second steak, most notable on the second steak was the fact that the steak butter was not melted, leading us to believe that the  steak was brought directly from the grill to the table, no time to rest under a lamp and overcook itself, a plus we thought. Until my husband cut into the second ribeye, again their signature steak, again substantially overlooked. At this point the server, who was speaking with my husband about the meal and appologizing about the previous steak appeared appalled that again, the steak was substantially overdone. He appeared embarrassed for the issues. We were promised no matter what it would be made up for and even the manager immediately addressed my husband and appeared completely appalled that the steak was so overdone, for a second time, (this time closer to medium well, maybe a high medium, but still nowhere near medium rare.) \n\nThe manager and server traded apologies and promised to make things right. Due to the fact that I had only had half of my filet, my husband opted to not receive another ribeye, instead choosing to just finish my meal. The server and manager happily took the ribeye off and purchased us two desserts for the troubles and issues. \n\nFor the good, the menu is amazing. In it's entirety, I believe it rivals some of the best steakhouses around. The lobster bisque is by far the best I've had, and as a fan of lobster bisque, I've had it at several 4 and 5 star restaurants all over the United States. Presentation, flavor, texture, everything was amazing. \n\nThe bone in bacon, if I didn't convince you before, it is one of the most flavorful dishes I have ever had, the watermelon is a little strange sounding but brings out so much flavor that again, I just can't put it into words, you have to experience this dish!\n\nMy filet oscar was great, perfectly cooked, very flavorful and perfectly seasoned. I just wish I had a second stomach to finish it after almost licking the plate of lobster bisque and bone in bacon. \n\nDesserts were great as everything else, and the after dinner drink list is as expansive as the wine list. If you can imagine it, they have it. \n\nMy only issue is my husbands meal, again I feel bad because I understand mistakes happen, but it was very unfortuonate that for a dinner to celebrate our first annivarsary, at the end he/we were disappointed. He continued to describe it as "the food was amazing, but not what I was hoping for." \n\nI personally have issues with a $300 meal (granted $130 of it being an amazing and perfectly reccomended bottle of wine,) being disappointing in any way. Again mistakes happen and I believe firmly that they are rare at Delmonicos, but I cannot change this disappointing experience. \n\nIf this is the only negative review that you read please do not discount this restaurant. Again, mistakes happen, and even as I write this, I feel bad for not giving the restaurant better ratings because so many things were good and accidents happen, but it doesn't change the experience tonight. Hopefully, as it appeared, this will be a rare experience and we may give this restaurant another shot the next time we're in Vegas, but as this was supposed to be a special meal celebrating, I will say disappointing is the best way to describe it. The restaurant has so much more potential and obviously could have done so much better than we experienced, we were just unlucky. Again, no fault on the waitstaff, they were amazing, but overall experience was disappointing. I hope others have better luck than we did.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4EnQ6EuRnQk5g5pLaKTJQw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
6prMgAjp2LZjuxRvmrFDIQ	4	2015-01-01 00:00:00	We were seated promptly for our 5:30 p.m. reservation on Monday, 12/29/2014. Front of house service was exceptional. The food took a while to make it to the table, which was a little surprising as the restaurant was not busy. My wife loved her filet. My bone in ribeye was good, but by far not the best I've had. The meat was over fatty. The sides were very tasty, including the asparagus and the twice baked potato. I would go again, but I'd order the filet instead of the ribeye.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	bMFqD4beGrt_LjNGG_7xng	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We often stop in and see our favorite server, Michael Jackson, who simply completes the fine dining experience for us. He is always so pleasant and knowledgable about the menu and suggests amazing dishes each time! I have never been disappointed here and will be back soon!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	oFyOUOeGTRZhFPF9uTqrTQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
6vpOJFy0ehAJR1fzAhPDLw	5	2017-06-21 00:00:00	We had a memorable dinner celebrating our anniversary at Delmonico Steakhouse having our usual classic choices plus some signature Emeril dishes. The service was everything that you would expect from an Emeril restaurant plus more with Chef Rainwater and staff rolling out the red carpet making the night special for my wife and I.\n\nGreeted with congratulations on our anniversary at the host stand, we were seated immediately for our Thursday night 8 PM reservation along the wall in the classy main dining room. A nice touch that we noticed toward the end of the meal was that although the restaurant was almost at capacity, no diners were sat at any adjacent table leaving us secluded for the entire meal. We had a few bonus tastings added to our meal including two complimentary celebratory desserts. And at the end of the meal, the friendly manager who was overseeing our entire meal, escorted us to the kitchen where we had a brief word with Chef Rainwater and photo op.\n\nIf you're looking for a cocktail, check out their creative list which some of the drinks looked very interesting, but I just stayed with my Irish whiskey. The wine list is also extensive enough that they carried a couple of choices for my picky wife. Emeril mainstays such as the barbecue shrimp and banana cream pie are items that you should try at least once. The poached main lobster was a special for the night that did not disappoint. The highlight for my meal was the bone in ribeye with Creole seasoning topped with maitre d' butter. I savored every bite of the dry aged beef and I don't think there's much doubt that I could have eaten another one.\n\nThe tab was just over two bills which I had no problem with the splurge and felt it was well worth it with the gracious hospitality we received. You'll find your classic steakhouse dishes at Delmonico but you'll also see some twists with Creole influence. You'll also be assured that the service will uphold the Emeril standard.	3	1	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Jbd1x8jj3EgOkQMZ3RImKw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
6VYgC_yK-PQCXFsqXLSxsA	5	2012-03-05 00:00:00	Yes Yes Yes! I'm probably repeating all the great things people said already but it is true. My husband and I were there this past weekend and we were satisfied 100%! And after reading the reviews I'm not sure why people minus the 5th star because of the price. In my opinion if you are looking for an amazing fine dining experience you must be wiling to spend the money. We were here for about three hours and we enjoyed every bit of it. We let our waiter know in advance that we were in no rush and he made sure to plan the timing of our appetizers and main just right. We were watching the blue man group after dinner and wanted to drink a few drinks before we left.\n\nEvery time we went to the bathroom they folded our napkins, refilled our drinks before we even had time to ask, and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu --- that alone just shows the attention to detail. In addition to the lobster bisque, french escargot, cream corn gratinne, creole gulf shirmp cocktail...:) I had the hot Alaskan King Crab Legs and my husband had the Bone in RibEye. He said "it is the best steak he has ever had" ( please take in consideration that we had travel all over the world).  The noise was moderate, besides I'm in Vegas and I wanted to dine in a lively and happy place not a quiet boring place.  Even though the dining room was open it is still cozy and romantic and easy to have a private conversation.  \n\nIt has become one of our favorite places to go and we will definitely come back again!	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	1xfFTKkHLtxQQCV1fCppaA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
6WfZ6npnP6IBYNzi9I7GCg	5	2014-09-07 00:00:00	This place is a little gem.  Yes it is very pricey but the service combined with great food make it a great place to dine.  We had the NY Steak and Rib Eye along with the truffle chips, buttered broccoli and the chocolate cake. First the service is impeccable five star all the way.  The hosts have only a few tables and are very accessible while not being overbearing.  They have assistants that are every bit the professional as the hosts.  Was treated very well.\n\nThe food is amazing.  The steaks are quite large and bone-in meaning great flavor.  I think better than Ruth's Chris even.  The sides were good the truffle chips are highly recommended!  and the pop-overs that they start with are good if not a bit heavy.  \n\nThe chocolate cake was also great.  The place is pricey for sure but you get what you pay for here.  Highly recommend this place for a great experience!	2	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	-L1yBTxJ9O9HysxDNjHuog	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
6xVFOp_SQAM2VQ_Avdfh3w	4	2009-05-08 00:00:00	My experience at Delmonico Steakhouse was well-above average, but not as fantastic as I thought it would be.  First off, although we had made reservations well in advance, we had to wait over 20 minutes for our table.  All was not completely lost, however, since we passed the time in Delmonico's classy little, modish bar area where we got started on our red wine for the evening. \n\nThere was a bit of confusion amongst the servers shortly after we were seated, and we experienced a delay in receiving our selection of bottled waters for our table.  At Delmonico, they give you the option of choosing from a few types of bottled and mineral waters for an additional charge, or you can request just regular,complimentary tap water. After the initial delay, our water glasses were refilled continuously throughout the meal, however. \n\nLike most five star restaurants, at Delmonico Steakhouse, you receive service from several members of the waitstaff, which ensures constant attention and most of your dining needs are met without even having to request anything.\n\nThe interior of the steakhouse was minimalist, with tables covered in cream colored linens and simple, modern brown leather chairs for seating. The space had a slightly Mediterranean feel due to its coved ceilings.  No doubt because the restaurant is located inside the Venetian Hotel, they wanted to maintain a slightly Italian theme througout. \n\nThe restaurant, which was was packed with patrons, was also very loud.  I think the coved ceilings were extremely conducive to the noise level contained in the dining room.  This combined with brighter than desired lighting, created a slightly less intimate dining experience than were were anticipating.  \n\nThe food was very good, however.  We started with the crabcake, and it was tender, buttery and delicious.  Followed by that, were our iceberg wedge salads with bacon, blue cheese and all the yummies.  Hubby ordered the bone-in ribeye, and I ordered the bone-in NY strip, both were cooked to medium perfection.  For sides, we shared a huge, delicious baked potato with sour cream, bacon, green onions and cheddar. For dessert, we shared the caramel creme brulee, and it was very, very good.\n\nOverall, we enjoyed our meal very much, and we would return here again for the food.  Our experience was just was not over-the-top fabulous because of the noise and lighting factors.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	1sZslemAiU_d8_mTdoZ_Bw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
6YNPXoq41qTMZ2TEi0BYUA	2	2016-02-16 00:00:00	The food was decent, but the service was definitely sub par (especially for the price!).It took 15-20 minutes for the server to acknowledge us  just so that we order drinks. Our dinner was good but I have to say that I was disappointed that they did nothing to acknowledge my birthday celebration. We chose this restaurant over STK & CUT to celebrate the occasion and I wish we hadn't. They did nothing to acknowledge our occasion which was sad. I will not be going back to this restaurant again.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2S6gWE-K3DHNcKYYSgN7xA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
6ZeLaj4cuxJ6mp6RAd1Xcw	2	2015-02-04 00:00:00	I'll start with this: I'm not a fan of Emeril Lagasse.\n\nWhy? I don't know. I've never really been a fan. When Food Network showed actual shows instead of Guy Fieri and his 90's hair, Emeril, Bobby Flay, Tyler Florence, and Giada ruled the network. Oh, and Michael Chiarello, but I've been to his restaurant and that was phenomenal. That aside, BAM! was the most popular saying in the food world, people flipped their shit over it, and now Emeril has his face on every cheaply made saucepan and spice around grocery stores for twice the markup. I always thought he was off-putting.\n\nThat being said, this is a seafood/steakhouse, and it's upscale. I've been to CUT, so I know that Wolfgang Puck is better than his canned soups. There's a chance Emeril would live up to the (very pricey) hype.\n\nThe drinks were good - a cab and a pinot noir were actually quite nice, and the cocktails looked amazing. Maybe your bar staff can teach your kitchen staff a little something about pride in their product.\n\nFirst up: the vine-ripened heirloom tomato salad with burrata. Am I supposed to eat through the thick, rock hard center of this tomato? Are you serious? I paid $20+ for a salad that consisted of five slices of heirloom tomato and a dollop of burrata on top, and you're going to give me several slices that were pure unripened tomato? Fuckin hell. I was disappointed. Okay? So disappointed. Come on, how fucking hard is it to serve a RIPE tomato?\n\nFor the entree we ordered the wagyu ribeye and the ahi tuna. The tuna was fine - it was tuna. I'd opt for two pieces, as pepper crusted seared ahi for me can get overwhelming after a while (nigiri is a totally different situation). The battered mushrooms were a nice touch, as well as the sauce.\n\nBut the wagyu. Okay, look. You're paying $90 for a fucking steak. For a steak that ISN'T KOBE - please, for the love of god, don't confuse the two. And it's not big, it's small. Is it wonderfully marbled with fat? Yes! To me, it was great! I thought it was wonderful! But this is why my review just went down a star while writing this:\n\nWhen you pay $90 for a goddamn steak, you'd better bring it out hot. Like, searing hot. Like on a 400F plate like Mastros, hot. RIGHT off the goddamn pan hot. When it comes out just barely hot anymore, and then slips right into lukewarm, what the fuck? What kind of $90 experience is that? The cow has given it's life, with the production of so many people trying to make it wonderful, and you RUIN the experience. Plus it was a little too salty.\n\nYou're probably thinking, "Jesus Jaime, you're a bit of a prick, and a snob. I can see your brain from how high you're holding your nose from here."\n\nYeah, alright. I'll give you that. But you know what? I'm not going to pay fucking $90 for a goddamn steak if it isn't treated PERFECTLY. I can get a $25 steak that's handled better than that, I don't give a fuck if it hasn't been drinking beer all its life.\n\nThen, to top off the evening of great disappointments, I ordered dessert. How HARD is it to fuck this up? When you have a great meal, you want to finish it with a bang, right? So you have the one thing on the menu people like (apparently the banana cream pie), and then fuck it to the rest of the dessert menu, right? For fucks sake people, GREAT dessert isn't that hard! It's SO EASY. Even worse, it's the biggest profit maker! If you call that Chocolate Truffle Cake a CAKE when it's drier than the Sahara desert, and that Strawberry Shortcake as such when there was barely any actual shortcake, AND the strawberries were mostly unripened with green parts on them, with a dollop of whipped cream on the side of the plate...then you should send your Pastry Chef back to school because clearly they need a kick in the ass.\n\nThis is an expensive meal where they prey off the idea that the people who come don't have any appreciation for the things they serve, so their level of care goes right out the 37th floor window of any hotel on the Strip.	18	17	7	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ZbOK_2m4kifew3lzTep1yQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
70wTr8A757ul33NVBlh-Tg	5	2012-01-15 00:00:00	Apparently finding a high-end restaurant on the Strip that serves lunch is more difficult than I thought. With many spots only open for dinner service I opted to dine at one of the few with a lunch menu -- Delmonico.  \n\nWe started with the wild arugula salad -- shaved apple, candied walnuts tossed in champagne vinaigrette with a trio of artisan cheeses. It was a large portion that they split for us.\n\nMy wife had a steak panini served medium rare on ciabatta. The accompanying horseradish was overpowering, but the beef was still excellent. The sandwich came with some amazingly crispy and light truffle fries.\n\nThe lobster sliders I ordered was a small order of two. The Maine lobster was lightly dressed with a citrus aioli and celery leaves, helping make this some of the tastiest lobster you'll find in any sandwich in town. The Old Bay fries that they came with were tasty, but not nearly as good as the truffle fries. My only complaint about this dish is the size. Something this delicious shouldn't be constrained to two sliders per order.\n\n4.5 Stars	6	2	6	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

73Tc3J6T4DCvvYDzC9di-Q	5	2016-12-17 00:00:00	This review is where I am sorry that you can only assign 5 stars because there are not enough stars to convey how much I adored this meal.\n\nThe atmosphere is perfect in noise level, pleasing color palate and space.  You are relaxed when you eat here.\n\nThe staff is welcoming and prideful in the job without sounding pretentious, the perfect blend of professional and friendly.  \n\nThe food-OH THE FOOD- the spinach salad, basically heaven on a plate,  tender spinach with a well balanced sherry vinaigrette and praline bacon pieces.  Let's just say, I was sorry that I offered to split it.\n\nThe filet and bone-in rib eye (our selections) were grilled to perfection, and I mean, perfection!!  Don't let the creole crust intimidate you, it is not overpowering and they're not ruining a beautiful cut with "stuff".  The twice-baked potato was hearty and delicious.\n\nThey will suggest the banana cream pie, which looks great, but I chose the pecan pie in an oatmeal shortbread crust.  This was so beyond fantastic in its tender and unique crust to the mellow nutty sweetness of the filling.\n\nI could seriously go on and on about this meal. I love to cook and I love to eat so it is a perfect evening when I feel like there is nothing I would change about the meal or think that I could have saved a ton of money and cooked myself.  Those thoughts NEVER ran through my mind.  So, next time I am in Vegas, I will return as soon as I get off the plane.  cannot wait.	3	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	dKFGhPr8EcGfJSS0ceDxFw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
747Q3wZ1bSETIkKU90Mubw	3	2009-11-25 00:00:00	I've had better BBQ shrimp at other Emiril's places, sauce here seemed over cooked, perhaps slightly burnt. Steaks were crazy expensive ($50!) and nothing special.  Sorry.  I can get a better steak in Houston (where I'm from) at a dozen or more places for half the price.  I'm sure the meat was high quality, and it was cooked properly... but it just wasn't anything special.  Not worthy of the $ anyway.  Service was a bit obsequious as well (which got annoying).  Overall it was a nice dinner, but for not a good value for the $.  There are many steak places in LV now, I'll try something else next time.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	U5KOnfycOv9Hh_TOwHUdMg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
74M4K8vsZHiDj4IX0CuMtg	4	2014-12-03 00:00:00	This was the steakhouse we decided to grub after my half marathon on the strip. I was concerned that my race attire didn't suit the ambiance and when we entered, we were welcomed. COOL! \n\nThe staff was outstanding and very informative of the menu. We were led to a private corner booth which made our dinner even more special. We were offered menus and an iPad for our wine selections. I ordered a champagne to celebrate my last race of the year, and the fiancee ordered a glass of Justin cab (one of his faves).\n\n-We were offered comped bread (popover) and butter. LOVE THE SOFT BUTTER!!! \n-Lobster bisque to share ($16)\n-Bone-in ribeye ($55)\n-Bone-in NY Strip ($50)\n-Twice Baked Potato ($9)\n-Duck Egg Creme Brûlée ($11)\n\nSteaks had a great rub on it and was topped with butter. YUP butter... Because I had the rib-eye, there was a lot of fat! YUM!!! I was only able to eat half my steak since it was so huge!!! The fiancee finished his NY. The potato was average and came with all the fixings on the side. I just wanted extra butter. Dinner was great.\n\nThe dessert was a bit disappointing. We ordered the duck egg creme brûlée since it was unique and highly recommended. At first the dessert was good, but after eating a couple more bites, the dessert started tasting a bit funny. It was so rich and I think the weird taste was getting to our tastebuds! Too bad there wasn't a molten lava cake!\n\nService and ambiance was superb. Love walking through the Palazzo to get this restaurant! Beautiful!!!	0	0	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	PkNs-Rw6MHQfu6j5pBZMMw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

79UOPiogou-qX6x8EhfKDA	2	2017-02-26 00:00:00	So me and my wife went here for our 20th wedding anniversary. It was Valentine's and I had made the reservation online. Well, we got all dressed up (for us,lol) and arrived about a minute or two before or 530 pm reservation and were seated within a couple minutes. The ambiance was great! Just what I was hoping for on this special night. So we peruse the menu and I decided to get the bone in ribeye and my wife selected the bone in NY strip. Both of which were touted as dry aged. We also got the buttered broccoli and potatoes augrautin. \n It took a good 30 minutes for our food to come out and were given 2 pieces of bread which were light and tasty. The servers waiting our table did an excellent job of keeping our water topped off. And when our food was ready a small army of servers marched up and placed everything almost simultaneously. They all were impeccably dressed and very attentive and polite. \n Well, now to the really disappointing part which is also the most important. The food. I'm a foodie. And in particular a steak connoisseur. This was in my opinion the worst dry aged steak I've ever had. Not even to mention at this price point. I've had better steaks at any number of chain restaurants. It came drenched in a marinade and was full of gristle. I honestly believe we were served a cheap choice or select cut instead of dry aged prime for which we paid. The sides were OK. But the steaks were bad. And when shelling out over $150 for it needs to be an amazing meal. Do I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this restaurant to anyone. And the only reason I didn't make a scene over the poor quality of our steaks was I was try desperately to salvage our special dinner. \n Emiril, step up the quality control!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	QUhvOjmdH7Chg0VjTcImmQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
7aj1xcFBYiH1Jg_OX6ZMhg	1	2016-05-22 00:00:00	Ohhh where to being....maybe I should start from the judgment from the host? Probably not a good idea to rudely look at people when they enter. Or maybe you shouldn't have a server who asked a personal question about my tattoos? Or maybe when he tried to get me and the 5 other girls to go to his part time job at TAO, then proceeded to ask me if I had another shirt because "I don't think they'd let you get in with a wife beater," because I'm wearing a tank top that isn't up to your personal standards. Hmmmm as an ex server there is NO WAY IN HELL I WOULD EVER TALK TO ANYONE LIKE THAT. Maybe in this gentlemans mind I am not good enough to be at his job, where he works to get paid, to probably help raise his family. Let everyone know beforehand that their is a prerequisite to even be acceptable in this restaurant. Yes I can wear tank tops, and yes I'm a woman I have breasts but to be stared down and then judge how I'm dressed is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE.\n\nMy entire dining experience was ruined. Why would I want to spend $134 on some wine and food just to be judged? For that I leave the server no tip and I promise I will never tell anyone about this restaurant based on experience alone. My friends told me how great it was and after 10 minutes I was embarrassed and self conscious. Thanks for wasting my money, time and what could have been a good experience.

7cRwmpHoc5fpjnsu0q-iRg	1	2012-03-06 00:00:00	A very disappointing experience overall. We went there for New Years Eve 2011/12 and were very disappointed to find that there were no decorations at all, and nothing had been done to bring out any kind of party atmosphere. The food was OK, but what really let the restaurant down was the service. Our waiter did not know the cocktail list. We had to spell the names of the cocktails we wanted for him to be able to order them for us. Same went for the wine, and once we got the wine, he didn't poor it for us a single time throughout the night, not even to taste when he first opened the bottle.\nClearing the table was slow, and no one came to offer dessert, coffee or anything else after we had finished our main course. Getting the bill also took some time, and not a single person acknowledged us when we got up to leave, not a "thank you" or even a "good bye". We felt like we were being ignored, or forgotten, as we could see the people at the table next to us being looked after a lot better than we were. There was no reason for them to treat us this way. I work in service myself and I always make a point to be nice, pleasant and polite when at a restaurant, and if an honest mistake is made, I am normally very forgiving, but this was too much. We expected much better and I would not recommend this restaurant at all.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2xZCgpYf-eFL6LI_5ePLhg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Of the eight in our group - seven of us ordered the Bone-In Ribeye - the eighth ordered a Filet.  Bottom Line - Everyone Was Pleased.\n\nThe cuts were ample.\nThe cooking-temperatures perfect.\nThe flavor excellent.\nThe texture exceptionally tender.\n\nOf note also, was the table-side Caesar Salad.

I had the bone-in New York steak medium. It had a perfect char and cooked how a steak needs to be. I am a big fan of the New York because it is a leaner cut. The bone-in Ribeye steak medium rare was what my brother-in-law had and that just melted like butter in your mouth. The creme of corn was outstanding!  The Smashed potatoes were fine.

7fEOnfezstN7hdysTeM8xQ	3	2010-03-27 00:00:00	Note to Vegas douchebags (all of you): when you are planning a dinner at a well known restaurant that's oozing stars and dollar signs, Ed Hardy is not considered dressing up. This is my splurge dinner on this vacation. I'm writing this at the table - key tones off of course, keeping it classy. I had a reservation for 9:00, got there 5 minutes early, and waited 25 minutes. Not unheard of, but neither is an apology or a "thank you for waiting." I also felt a little ignored as a single diner not ordering alcohol. My soda glass sat empty for a long time before I was asked if I wanted another. This happened twice, once between appetizer and main course, and once when i had a third of my steak left. No mention of whether I would be charged for refills, but either way that will be factored into the tip.  Either assume that I would like it refilled and don't let it hit the table empty, or show some sort of bottle or other indication that I'll be seeing $4-5 each on the bill. I also didn't appreciate the lonely roll that was deposited on my table. Just because I'm by myself doesn't mean I don't want a little basket of warm rolls to scarf down at my leisure. I was asked if I wanted another after I was done, and I declined. It was also brought out at the end of the appetizer, which indicated to me that it had been initially forgotten.  My appetizer was completely delicious. I am sad to inform you that it was a special and may not be there when you dine. It was lump crab and gnocchi. Pesto, brown butter, lemon. The crab tasted like Dungeness, the best of course. The gnocchi was toasty and so delicate that I could have eaten it with a spoon like ice cream.  Next came the rib eye, medium, and creamed corn gratinee. The corn was good. The topping was crispy. The steak was definitely closer to medium well than medium. I expect a $50 steak to be flavorful and cut like butter. There were bites that I felt I was choking down. I also found it to be underseasoned. When I asked for sauces, I was given three options. Bearnaise, Emeril style A-1, and something muttered of which I only heard worcestershire. I think it might have been just that. I opted for the E-1. It didn't solve the seasoning issue and I found the taste odd.  The verdict is in on the diet coke. It was three dollars and I was not charged for refills. Why keep asking then?  I don't see how that could be considered elevated service. I had a much better meal and experience last year at SW at the Wynn. I will not be back to Delmonico.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AxVwKal1Mhp3OHIXlfmvZA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We took our friend and her husband here last night for her 40th birthday and the night couldn't have been more perfect! \n\nStaff/Service - exceptional! I think every person on the staff we interacted with wished her a happy birthday and even brought out a small dessert at the end of dinner. The sommelier stopped by our table several times and selected a great bottle for the table. He even came back at the end of dinner to talk about what Texas wines we recommend. Truly exceptional service. \n\nDrinks - you have to try one of their Sazeracs. \n\nFood- blows me away how exceptional the food is here. Ribeye was cooked absolutely perfect medium rare. Charred on outside. Perfect seasoning.  Duck fat fingering potatoes were also delicious. \n\nCouldn't have been happier to visit Delmonico and can't wait to go back!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	IUqoUE4U2ZM4q19ZHwKTYw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

7JNhOwUFGz4ptEKjMR6zVg	5	2011-08-10 00:00:00	My new husband and I just got married in Vegas on the 4th of August, and we went here on the 6th to celebrate during our vacation. We called for reservations on the day of, and they were able to accommodate us. When we arrived early, we sat in the bar area, and we had the most amazing drinks we both had ever had. I had a "green spade" which had cucumber, basil, and some other stuff in it. It was light, not to sweet and delicious. He had a bloody orange, which is a whiskey cocktail, and he loved it equally. I also had a limelight, which was good, and the best was the dark roast....delicious, smooth and incredible. They were about $14 a piece, and worth every damn penny. We were seated 15 minutes early. We told the waiter that this was our first "casual fine dining" experience, and he was more than informative. Made suggestions throughout the meal, and was personable and forthcoming. They had a nice "Our top Picks" for the wine. We chose a mid-price cab sav. They gave us complimentary truffle cream for an app, and then we ordered the tuna to go with it. The tuna was just average, but we live in Cocoa beach, so it's hard to impress us with seafood. The main event was the bone-in ribeye. I have eaten a shit ton of steak in my life....and DEAR GOD. This steak was impeccable. I didn't need a knife, I used my fork to cut it. The seasoning was just right, and I ordered mine rare, and that was how it was. My husbands was just the right medium rare....and perfect. Now, the only negative part of our meal. I ordered fingerling potatoes and asparagus as our sides. I had to send the potatoes back. They were nearly raw, and dry. The asparagus was edible, but boring. At nine dollars a piece, I expect a little zing. We were too full for dessert, but I'm sure it was great. The service was perfect, three waiters to a table. I was impressed with our overall bill total. They gave us cards that detailed where we sat and what waiters we had, so that we could have the same ones next year when we return for our anniversary. I will def be willing to return for another beautiful, whole experience.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	KF2MhqVQkA132VdUW24jug	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
7JpbT3G1M9nrESkggEjtMw	4	2007-08-22 00:00:00	I ate here way before I actually knew what fine dining was and when I would laugh over getting two tiny crab cakes for $12. In retrospect, it's a delicious gourmet establishment with a small menu that features a lot of variety - which I find to be extremely rare. \n\nThe service was excellent and the staff was patient with us asking questions about the food. The environment was very relaxed and there was plenty of space between each table so you felt like you had a bubble around your table. \n\nThey don't allow flip flops! but they didnt say anything to me...its just on the bottom of their business card :)	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	HwcjEqA1V3bKtb07JKGIKQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Do not miss the gumbo, and tomato salad for starters.  I love the bone in ribeye, and the bone in prime rib.  I have not been to Delmonico's in quite a few years.  As usual Emeril Lagasse's  restaurants never disappoint me, I once again enjoyed my meal.  The ribeye here is beyond compare.  For dessert do not miss Emeril's banana creme pie--my all-time favorite dessert.  BAM!	5	3	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	jOU73K85NeMzBsqwJtfu0A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

7lXirwdfeAMlakk3QZCIZw	3	2010-03-29 00:00:00	It's so sad that what made this place so memorable was that it was so mediocre... and that my travel buddy and I got into a heated discussion while trying to decide who's "fault" it was that we ended up there. We finally remembered how it happened - we were at the Palazzo and she wanted steak. I wanted to stop at Cut, but she wasn't a big fan of Wolfgang Puck. She likes Mario Batali, so we glanced over Enoteca's menu, but of course - they didn't have steak. If we'd known of the existence of Carnevino, we probably would've ended up there. I don't know if the steak would've been better..... but anyway, this is about Delmonico. \n\nBy the time we ended up in front of Delmonico's Steakhouse, we really were famished. It's Emeril's steakhouse - couldn't possibly be awful.............\n\nWe ordered:\n* A BOTTLE OF RED\n* JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKE\n         - [4/5 - Good crab cakes - not the best, but definitely took first place over everything else we had.]\n* GRILLED FILET MIGNON MEDALLIONS\n         - [3/5 - It was alright. Average in flavor, not tender.]\n* FILET MIGNON\n         - [2/5 - She's a huge steak fan but first, they overcooked her steak - then sent her a second steak, which was still not much better and a little chewy.]	2	2	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	BwFEjsr9yLqdszAmAxFYQg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

7owRZkvt5eAjRmIstK5BEw	5	2014-10-08 00:00:00	We wanted to catch a little Sunday Football while enjoying some great food. Our original plan was to spend Football Sunday at Lagasse's Stadium. But, we were greeted by a line of about 15 people waiting to get in.  Not too bad. But in the 20 mins we were there, the line never moved. "Sports Bar" or not, I should have known if it bears Emeril's name then a reservation should be made. So off we went to find a spot for football Sunday and came upon a sign at Delmonico announcing Sunday Football specials in the bar.  The bar was loaded with every liquor bottle imaginable and the menu... We'll it's Emeril Lagasse so enough said. We took a seat and ordered what turned out to be the best meal of our trip! My boyfriend and I ordered up a couple of cold beers, Truffled Parmesan Chips and Lobster Sliders to share. OH EM GEE!!  The Sliders were amazing! Nicely toasted roll filled with a creamy, perfectly seasoned lobster salad. No skimping on the lobster either. Nice, tender chunks and crisp pieces of celery for added crunch. Delish! The chips... We'll, we ordered another batch.. They were THAT good!  Crisp, crunchy, chips drizzled with truffle oil for that earthy yumminess and sprinkled with some tangy grated Parmesan. At halftime, we followed up with the Grilled Ricotta and Tomato Soup. Fantastic! Thick layer of creamy Ricotta and Basil between slices of buttered grilled toast. Not sure if the soup was intended for dipping but that's what we did! The soup was light and tangy -perfect for taking our ricotta sandwich for a dip!!  Meal was amazing & staff was friendly ( Michelle was super attentive). This isn't your Carlos and Charlie's or Senior Frogs so don't let the "football specials" fool you. You get what you pay for and you will definitely pay for what you get here! And it's worth it!!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	vI_QMf2lrkooRpu8kAcV2A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Never was a big fan of this, but it was really well done.  Tender, well seasoned, and cooked exactly right... a perfect combination.  Besides the steak being in the top 3 or 4 all time favorites (Marriott HI Kona and Waikiki tied for #1, chefs are brothers) the sides of scalloped potatoes and mushrooms are fantastic.   The service was exemplary.  Vegas is back!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	px-MoqLleUTxwq8F4SMGEg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
7URvy5Ea2dMZAPOlkRb6FA	2	2012-03-02 00:00:00	We were disappointed. Went there for anniversary dinner... There was no Bam, no kicking it up a notch, just kind of taste-free. Although we had three people assigned to the table the service was slow. After dropping the menus it took a while to take our drink order, and then a while longer to get them. but then we got the food before we finished the cocktail. OK. The main complaint is that the food just wasn't that good. Foie gras to start was OK, the wife had the filet and I had buffalo ribeye.  I knew buffalo is iffy, whether you get meat or gristle, but the waiter assured me it was not gamey. Well, this one didn't change my mind--the center was good but I had to do a lot of chewing to get to it. The filet was chewy and really had no taste to it. Creamed spinach had a definite cream taste, but where was the BAM? Same thing with twice baked potatoes--too liquid. To finish we had the espresso creme brulee, which was good, but too cold; with chocolate madelines that were not warm, and again, tasteless.  Just not worth the price we paid at all. I mean I've had better steak at Outback. Sorry Emeril.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	KFn24Ew8Dj7PEylzKWO-uQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
7YX6V9ViDRg6k6VhrVDUzQ	5	2014-05-31 00:00:00	I don't usually go to fine dine restaurants while in vegas, but I make a few exceptions and this was one of them. Came here with a few buddies for a birthday. The waiter made our experience a very easy one. He offered many different suggestions and options. After we finally made our decision, the kind gentleman complimented us with bread and such. Afterwards, he poured our glasses with wine and afterwards treated the birthday girl to some lovely dessert. On to the food...\n\nAt first I was on a budget, but then I said to myself, might as well splurge a little so i ordered the filet mignon and I have to admit, it was deeeeelicious. I did not order any sides with it, and wish i had ordered some sort of baked or mash potatoes. \n\noverall, i had a great experience and I would definitely refer someone to this place for great food and great service.	1	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	xXQCpHj0KU_dORHjS4SqaQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I've been here many times in the past several years, but I have to say, this last time was my most favorite, most memorable and most enjoyable.  \n\nI sat at the bar and met Max Solano; to say he was a bartender is an understatement.  I've never called anyone a "mixologist" before, but if ever there was a man who deserved that title, its Max.  You can tell that his craft goes into every drink.  I sat at the bar, sipping what could have very well been the BEST Old Fashioned I've ever had and I watched him work.  He has the same passion behind the bar as a painter with a canvas, except his paint is liquor and his canvas, a glass.  With his jigger as a brush, he creates a drinkable Jackson Pollock\n\nMy steak was perfectly prepared and my time at the bar was most enjoyable.  It was a perfect finish to a long work week in Vegas.  I can't wait to go back.	0	2	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4EX-1cRrcSUP14SWmu8ESA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
8BwB870lAryIHCcFdXLbTg	3	2010-04-28 00:00:00	Food: 4 \nService: 2.5 \n\nDelmonico's was one of the first fancy-schmanchy places I'd eaten at in Vegas. However the last time I ate there was close to five years ago and I've eaten at many other places since then. My husband was eager to try it out again to see if it was as good as he remembered it to be. \nIn summary, I'd say the food was good, the service- not so much. \nWe were lead to our table in the back of the restaurant and even though it was nearly 10:00 pm, the restaurant was really crowded. I was pretty surprised but perhaps this is part of the reason we didn't receive the greatest service. \nFor the appetizer, I had ordered some sort of tomato salad thing from the specials that sounded really interesting. In fact, it was one of the items the server had recommended. However, about 5-10 minutes after ordering, the server came by and informed me they were out of it and asked me if I would like to order something else. The weird thing was, he wasn't apologetic at all, he simply said something along the lines of, "We're out of that, do you want to get another salad?" I'm not going to say he was downright rude but for a restaurant of this caliber, I definitely expected at the very least, some sort of apology. Perhaps even a free appetizer or dessert but perhaps I'm expecting too much? I settled on the salad with goat cheese and I do have to say it was delicious, one of the tastiest salads I can remember having in a long time. However, the journey in getting to that salad was a little bumpy. My husband had a pretty standard garden salad that I tasted and it was pretty good too. \nAnother problem with our ordering is when I tried to order my filet and they asked how I wanted it cooked, I told them my usual method of between medium and medium well, no blood. Okay, I know I am a little difficult but I've never had a problem with a place accommodating my request so at a high end steakhouse, I did not even consider that this would be a difficult task. Well, our server just flat out said he didn't think he could do that. Uhhh, what? Really? It's as if the steak was being cooked in a microwave with only set levels. It was so weird. So I was a little miffed. With that being said, my steak and my husband's steak was cooked properly when it came out. Just a shame that I had to get hazed about it when ordering. All our sides (grits, mushrooms, and spinach) had very generous portions and were pretty good too but perhaps but no real standouts either. \nEven though the steaks were a few dollars pricier than other comparable steakhouse such as Carnevino, I did appreciate that the three steak sauces came free. Other places charge $2-$3 per sauce so it really balanced out and it was nice to try all three. \nI can never resist dessert so I got something I believed was some sort of banana tart. I was surprised when something resembling a big hunk of mud pie with a giant mound of whip cream came out. I took a few bites but it was a bit overwhelming for me. \nAll in all, I would say the food was good but not as good as I remembered it five years ago. Or perhaps I've been spoiled by the different restaurants I've been to since then. My biggest complaint was the service- not only the issues as stated above but just overall, the service felt impersonal and disjointed. I would have to guess that since the restaurant seemed very busy and it was near the end of the night by the time of our reservation, the servers had probably run out of patience. Understandable, we've all had bad days at work but I don't like feeling like the scapegoat. \nI still wouldn't hesitate in recommending Delmonico's to people since my food was good but perhaps I'd recommend a reservation earlier in the day and hope that would alleviate the service issues.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	USoDds58VsEJXyVmfp7kBg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Making reservation at other Las Vegas restaurant is so tortuous. \n\nFor appetizers I enjoyed the gumbo over rice and some Artisanal Cheeses.\n\nMy bone in Ribeye was made middle rare to perfection. This was the best steak I ever had in vegas.\n\nFor dessert, my banana cream pie was out of this world.

8eEp26oqTXmuIjVUJpLXHw	3	2014-02-25 00:00:00	It was a real up and down evening.\nApps - BBQ shrimp were great but there's only 4 of them so don't expect to get filled up.\nEntrees - my wife had the filet medallions and they were basically disgusting. They were terrible cuts of meat and she was only able to eat about half of it. I had the bone in ribeye which was fine but nothing spectacular.\nSides - we had the creamed corn which I thought was terrific, my wife not so much. The potatoes gratin were good but you better like parmesan if you order them. \nDessert - the greatest piece of banana creme pie I've ever had, and it's monsterous!! \nDrinks - They didn't have the bacon and bourbon manhattan but the bartender said we weren't missing anything....so why keep it on the menu? Anyway, to finish off the night I had a Dusk in the Burroughs which is just about the perfect after dinner drink. That and the banana creme pie were easily the best things we had the entire evening. \n\nThe service was top notch and they took the medallions off the bill and also comped the pie, all without my wife saying anything more than she wasn't impressed with the steak. \nIn the end the start was good and finish was fantastic, but with the steaks being so bad it really took away from the whole experience. At roughly $50 a steak we just expect way way better, and with so many fine dining options in Vegas it's tough to see us going back anytime soon. Maybe eventually, but it'll be a while if we do.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AdxhlxXSGjRsCQxG6ZjfTw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I had to call a server to order bottle of wine and it was explained to us we had to give waitress a number! As we waiting I could observe they tailor more quickly to the larger groups of guests! I hope the food is better than the service. Being an elegant restaurant with hefty prices you would expect a sophisticated bathroom right?

8ibsaxqCDMogYpmTqlVtTg	1	2014-03-04 00:00:00	How does one spell grossly overrated...Delmonico's!!! First, I have seen more originality in a Denny's restaurant in terms of decor. This place is as boring to the eye as watching paint dry...that should have been my clue to exit right!!! There is no color, no cool lighting, no cool art, no great looking floors...nope, a two year old could have designed a more interesting restaurant.\n\nNow let's talk food. It is 3am and I'm on the toilet, let's start there!!! They hand me a steak they claim is prime beef. The only thing prime was the price...52 bucks! The meat was not only tough, but like the decor, it had no taste...NONE. Cosco has better steaks then that thing they brought me. \n\nSo they do take it back a I ordered rack of lamb for, yes, 55 bucks!!! Now those little four rib racks were excellent...but not 55 bucks worth of excellence.  Where's the MEAT! \n\nThen it is time to go to the bathroom...you won't believe it...a dirty, filthy two stall bathroom!!! And the road to the bathroom, and I purposely used the word road, was a journey in itself. How is it that a place that charges 55 bucks for a rack of lamb can have such a piece of s@&t bathroom? \n\nAnd as I sit here on the toilet at 3am all I can tell you is if you think this place is great, then you are from Hoboken NJ because this is a grossly over rated restaurant with horrible food, decor, bathrooms, etc. the owner is laughing to the bank with the fools who go here...AVOID this place. \n\nThe restaurant manage reached out to me...good for them...but I'm not interested.  You get ONE chance to make your reputation, and Mr. Celebrity Chef, you lost it here.  AWFUL PLACE!  GROSSLY OVER PRICED!  DON'T WAIST TIME OR MONEY HERE!	1	4	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	5RMrBxjIIvdTBl5prcAzvQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I loved how I have never been let down when I have gone there.  I really enjoy steak, and his bone-in ribeye was the best I have EVER had - the crust on the medium-rare perfection was amazing.  \n\nThat being said, I expect a great steak at any steakhouse I go to, so that's not enough to make this my best meal ever.  However, the sides and dessert we equally amazing! The creamed spinach is unlike any other I've ever had, the mushroom were succulent, and the football sized baked potato really hit the spot.  The service was great, the ambiance is perfect, and the chairs and tables are very comfortable.\n\nI wish I could come here more often.  Every time I plan a vegas trip, the sure bet is that I will be here.  I loved it, and I think you would too.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	zHvwZn2UWbed7CZjjrePFg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
8Lkdb_TyJDn8knJX0hic0w	4	2006-09-19 00:00:00	My buddy booked this place for my bachelor party dinner. We had a group of 10 but the restaurant can only seat parties of 9 at most together at one table.  Since we had 10, they had to put us on two separate tables, which was ok, because they were right next to each other anyway.\n\nDecor:  nothing spectacular.  i thought it was alittle too dim for me.  I like a well lit restaurant for the purpose of really getting to see the different colors of your food and wine.  You can tell a lot about your food by it's color...it's freshness, it's doneness, etc.\n\nFood:  Very good.  I had the filet and it was super tender.  My buddies ordered the bone in rib-eye and almost all said it was amongst the best steaks they ever had.  Everything is a la carte so we shared sides of grilled asparagus (good), garlic smashed potatoes (yummy), sauteed wild mushrooms (yummy), and caesar salad (good).\n\nService:  Very good also.  Our waiter was very polite even when our rowdy half drunk group couldn't decide on what to order.  He was very helpful with the wine and picked out a nice bottle of merlot that worked with our budget.  Server's were very fast and attentive.  They made sure everything was perfect...which pretty much was.\n\nPrice:  Pretty fair and expected of a high end steak house.  bone in 20 oz. rib-eye was about $50 and my 12 oz. filet was around $45.  Sides were around $8-12, and one order feeds 2 people.  Yes, they have an extensive wine list and Yes, they have seafood also.\n\nOne last important note:  there isn't a smoking/non-smoking section, so people with kids, and non-smokers beware.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	XL805HGrepwIPX5Rg9cPng	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I have been going to this steakhouse for the past 8 years. Pretty much every time I visit Vegas; we find a way to to have dinner there. I have tried the pork chops for dinner. But my "go to" entree is ALWAYS the RIB EYE. It is done to PERFECTION. Always EXPERTLY cooked and seasoned. TENDER and almost MELTS IN YOUR MOUTH. The sign of an EXCELLENT STEAKHOUSE - is that your steak is ALWAYS cooked to order and does not need much in the area of extra sauces. Your steak comes with an assortment of Emeril's sauces. I have never needed them and prefer to eat the steak "as is". Service is IMPECCABLE. Your drinks are brought quickly. Your water glass is never empty. Entrees and side dishes are delectable beyond your dreams. Also, the most AMAZING Banana Cream Pie I have ever had the pleasure of eating in my Life. TRUST ME. Spending money at Delmonico Steakhouse is WELL SPENT and I doubt you will be disappointed. It is a true dining EXPERIENCE.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	DJN-sRseo4ctizElZ5KUvQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

This is the best steak that I have ever put in my mouth.  This place is well worth every penny.  I ordered the bone in rib eye.  I did not even need a knife to cut the steak.  The steak was melt in your mouth delicious.  The bacon wilted spinach salad is bomb!  I have never enjoyed a salad or steak this good.  I make it a point to stop by this place when I am in Vegas.  \n\nWent back in September and the restaurant has lost it.  Ordered the bone in ribeye and it tasted like death. The maître d, said the meat was over aged.  Why the hell would you serve it if the quality was not up to standards.  After issues with food we were treated like crap.  Not impressed. There are tons of good restaurants in Vegas. Don't waste you time or hard earned money!	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	n0y7p7B1NMia_3lpk7xK3A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Nothing to really say about it.\n\nMidweek I had to go for some seafood, sure it's a steakhouse, but the bbq salmon it was.  Nothing too special, overall I'm not too fond of Delmonico.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	VFXKRVzEMbnsDcYFdwiiuA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
8pSmBpi5_Zo2afoXXon0tA	5	2010-11-30 00:00:00	BY FAR my favorite steakhouse in the country.  The steak is seasoned perfectly, no sauce required.  All sides we ordered were great and I think we ordered every side on the menu, you must get truffle and parmesan chips!  The service is incredible, a completely orchestrated dinner service is always impressive when your at a table of 9 and each plate hits the table at the same time.  Servers/staff are watching every movement and are very good at anticipating needs and requests.  The dining room has a modern minimalist look but very nice, you dont hear this much but the tables and chairs were really nice.  When in Vegas make sure you go to Delmonico.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	DxPZ7XCE_QjyZ6UFUNEL7Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

D's ain't worth it.\n\nI was there with a bachelor party, twelve dudes, and the average price was $120+ for each person.\n\nMy food: bone in rib eye, medium rare, shared a side of creamed spinach, and no drink.\n\nYes, all this for $120.\n\nRib eye: cooked perfectly, huge slab of meat.  I expected a nice marble, maybe a little excess fat, but by the time I was done, maybe a quarter of the original steak was off to the side...all fat and gristle.  I'm also spoiled and used to the 300 degree plate that you get at good ol' Mastro's, and since D's steak is served on a regular plate, the huge steak seemed to get cold pretty damn fast.\n\nCreamed spinach:  I could have gotten something better out of a can.  Got stone cold real fast too.\n\nAll this for $120.  \n\nService: Very good and very attentive.\n\nGuess this is where my $120 went.\n\n...\n\n$120 \n\n:(	0	2	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	26djyE-mvBsZ4rU2_jj4vw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The style and ambiance is very simple and chic. If I may add another word - classy.\nThe service was impeccable! The waiters (we had 3), were so welcoming and genuinely interested in how they could make our stay there memorable. So that's always a big plus for me (i do not like snooty waiters). \nThe food was great! Not the best I've tasted but still up there =). I had the white fish with lump crab and it was delicious! The fish was soft and not chewy at all and the crab definitely complimented the slight saltiness of the fish. Great find!\nThe New orleans bbq shrimp were a tad too salty for my taste, but nevertheless, delicious.\nI would've definitely ordered dessert, but I was so full that I just couldn't get myself to do it. \nIn any case, I had a wonderful time and I must implore you to try it if you are ever at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas (did that sound classy??? eh i tried). Lol.\nBottom line: go for it!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	6wVJrz3w2mtufjs6t5ExUw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
8VqFO1Jt_BxaUG-vIHISLQ	4	2012-03-04 00:00:00	I really liked Delmonico.  It's a bit pricey, but not unusual given the quality and location in the Venetian.  I especially loved the lobster bisque - definitely try it.  The Ahi Tuna Tartar was pretty good, but not a must get.  My friend and I shared the Chateaubriand filet, which was perfectly done and delicious.  Highly recommended!  \n\nAnd, as icing on the cake, they have an incredible scotch list.  \n\nThey are able to accommodate large groups, which is nice - but even with a reservation, our wait was an hour, which is unacceptable - minus one star.\n\nI've grown to like Vegas more and more as I've learned that they have something for everyone - great food, shows, clubs, gambling, outdoor activities, pools, shopping, etc.  Delmonico is a great addition to the already outstanding food selection in Vegas.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	e6QRXwwzhebaLVX0JEztpg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
8xkfWTc6KvjwZH6nkMvVDA	4	2012-08-10 00:00:00	Steakhouses in Vegas are like Starbucks in the USA... they're everywhere. If you're passing by a nice restaurant in a hotel casino, there's a good chance that it's a steakhouse. Maybe Vegas has figured out that eating an expensive steak will make you feel better despite the fact that you just lost hundreds of dollars...\n\nSome friends and I had lunch at Delmonico's this past weekend and we got there right when it opened for lunch. We were their first customers and spent most of our lunch being the only people in the restaurant. Therefore, I guess it's no surprise why we got such great service. We made small talk with our servers and they were very pleasant and attentive throughout our entire meal.\n\nOne friend who has been here before was raving about their lobster bisque and banana creme pie. I got to try their lobster bisque ($16) and thought it was good but I'm no connoisseur of bisque.  The bisque comes with scrumptious pieces of lobster and it was very rich and creamy. I ordered the Filet of Beef Medallions ($21) and they were super tender. Although they were covered in bread crumbs and a mushroom type sauce, the medallions were quite delicious. The entree isn't very big and I was still hungry afterwards so I suggest getting this alongside an appetizer. I got a bite of the Banana Creme Pie and not only did it look amazing, the taste of it was delightful. \n\nDelmonico's is a surprisingly huge restaurant. I hope their dinner draws in a larger crowd that it does for lunch or else much of their space could be put to better use. The lunch menu is rather limited but it's priced right with the most expensive entree being only $21. All in all, pretty good food and extremely good service. You gotta try that Banana Creme Pie!	4	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3jjiY5D7oIlKeiCIZGHQew	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The service was superb ! The food had so much flavor and everything was cooked to perfection . When you sit in the back the chef picks what you eat and that is the way to go.  I tried the foie gras, it tasted like a dessert and was so good. We started with halibut with risotto , lamb, ribeye and the best dessert ever.

Lights on a wire cable is the extent of that. Don't expect more, I'm not joking. Not a painting, wall paper, photo, drawing or stitch of color. Anywhere. Plain, off white walls.\n\nThe bread was lovely (I always taste the bread) I ate it all, without shame.\n\nSpecialty cocktails were all great, we tried 3, all of which I forgot the names of but the gin with Midori was my fave, I may have had 2 possibly 3 lol\n\nFood was above average but not mind blowing\n\nKing crab app was okay, didn't taste fresh to me\n\nTable side Cesar salad was good, I liked the dressing and loved the anchovies but the presentation was done behind me so I didn't get to enjoy the show. Note to self-when you return don't sit in a booth. \n\nBone in ribeye was yummy. We shared, but it wasn't the medium my husband ordered but I wasnt devastated because I prefer medium rare although it was closer to rare. Mushrooms were good, nothing special.\n\nCaramel cake was delish, very sweet but that's the point! \n\nWe will be back, it will be awhile since date nights are rare due to a 2.5 year old child beast but we will be back. I look forward to the filet.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	V7cGEFexpXTY-jKWhqkHcw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

9KEFJt0hZAnKMBcsYyoeDQ	5	2015-09-28 00:00:00	Amazing does not explain how great this dinner was!  My wife and I were there to celebrate our anniversary, which eating at a fine dining steakhouse is becoming the annual tradition.  \n\nI had made a reservation, and when we arrived, we were greeted numerous times from several different people offering congratulations on our anniversary.  This made everything seem special for my wife, who had no idea we were coming here.  Then we were taken to our table.\n\nWe were given a near endless wine list (book!) and expected to decide from there?  No, the sommelier came over and determined our wine for us, and did not pick the most expensive bottle, but one of the best ones we have had, for way less than the next closest we had drank a while back.\n\nThe menu is not too over the top, but just right.  I wanted to have the escargot, but my wife cannot bring herself to eat this, so we had the BBQ shrimp.  Being from Texas, we love barbeque, but this was different, and superb.  Four huge shrimp covered in a sauce that I have never had the likes of before.  Our main entrée was the Chateaubriand cooked tableside.  I enjoy my steak rare to med-rare, but my wife does not like to see blood in her steak. (I know, I'm working on this)  They were able to cook the same piece of meat to my liking as well as hers and it came out perfect.  Not a thing was left on either of our plates. \n\nWe concluded the meal with two desserts, I had Emeril's banana cream pie.  An incredible end to a wonderful meal.  My wife had the crème bruele,  and explained it in details I have never heard her use to explain food.  On top of this, we were given a small sample of sorbet with a happy anniversary not written in chocolate on the plate.\n\nThere were so many waiters and helpers taking care of our every need that it was almost impossible to say who was the actual waiter, although the main waiter was superb.  He took over for the cook at our table because he knew exactly how we wanted the steak, and never did he let anything sit out of place, no drink ran low, and not one thing was missed.\n\nAgain, amazing can not explain how great this meal was.  We will definitely stop again next time we are in Vegas!\n\nI knew how much it would be before we went, but for the sake of a review, I will say our meal for two was right at $300, but well worth it.  If you are looking for a fine dining restaurant and not wanting to spend this much, then you aren't really looking for fine dining.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	tx7HC4RgL6yjV_mv7zypEQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We've also enjoyed daily specials that have served up surf and turf, and some of the tastiest lamb chops we've ever tasted. We've sampled a bunch of other dishes, as well. The only disappointment has been at dessert and that was banana cream pie. It was served partially frozen. Ever since we tend to skip dessert and treat ourselves to Jamaican Blue Mountain French pressed coffee, instead. It is wonderful.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

CUT has been my absolute favorite place for steak and fine dining for the past five years but we decided to try somewhere new for once.\n\nFood (4): The food was great but I wasn't blown away. I didn't leave the restaurant replaying every bite. We ordered the heirloom tomato soup (with grilled cheese sandwich), mac and cheese, crab legs, and two steaks. I got the special steak of the day that came with shaved pieces of truffle on top. Don't get me wrong. Everything was delicious and I had no problem with my food, but it just wasn't memorable. \n\nAmbiance (3.5): It's a fancy restaurant but felt like any other bougie restaurant inside of a Vegas hotel. We were seated at a corner table but there definitely could have been some more space between us and the pair next to us.\n\nService (4): Service was also a positive experience. Our waiter was pleasant and friendly and made small talk with us. And when my date found a long curly hair mixed into his crab legs, the waiter apologized and took it back without a second thought. When he came back with a new plate the legs looked like they came from the fattest crabs possible.\n\nSo overall, a wonderful experience and I would have no qualms about returning. But CUT remains my favorite steak restaurant.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Q_rLU91XQYgI6FZPf4JfZg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
9S-lstGd1L1ZXBI_m7Ff1A	3	2016-02-17 00:00:00	We had planned this Valentine's Dinner/birthday dinner for over a week and were really looking forward to it. Service was superb, venue/ambiance was lovely. We ordered a sea scallop, mushroom and black truffle sauce appetizer- it was tasty. We both had the lobster bisque, nothing special, but very good, and presentation was nice. My husband ordered the double-cut pork chop, the size of a dinosaur. It was supposed to be medium, but was charred and a bit over done. I ordered the sea bass, but asked the chef to prepare it like the snapper special. It was thin, overly salted, and overall just not good. I am not a fan of al dente rice. I'm sure the chef prepares entrees a certain way for a reason, this just missed the mark in so many ways for me, when I had such high expectations. The head server promptly replaced my meal with a medium rare filet, in about 60 seconds. The steak looked dry, besides the pat of butter atop, the plate was hot, making me think it had been under the food warmer for some time. There was a crusted char on the exterior and Cajun seasoning, which again in my opinion was too much, and too salty. I want to taste the steak at a steakhouse, not cover it. Of all of the options in Vegas, we could get a lot better tasting food with equivalent price and service elsewhere. We will not be returning.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	QHUe6yCmhOZtngkfxdCjZQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

They made sure we were completely taken care of throughout the whole experience.  We chose a bottle of a wine for the meal and it paired perfectly. The wine list was the most extensive list I had seen in a long time. It was all broken down by style of wine and where the grapes originated from. Then we chose the house salad to pair with a half dozen oysters. The oysters were absolutely wonderful and the dressing for the house salad was great as well. I ordered crab crusted medallions and my boyfriend ordered the filet. Both came out perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth. We were too stuffed to take on the desert menu but the overall experience at Delmonico was delicious. I would recommend to anyone and everyone.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	caGSq9m4G4VL8eWKp1KNyw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

It seemed more like let's cover up the fact that I can't cook with tons of salt.\n\nBy the time I left the restaurant, I felt like my blood pressure must be sky high with all the salt I ingested. \n\nNeedless to say, I won't be going back here again.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2wfU9DHb_VsEt3P0sC0sWw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The pappardelle mushroom pasta appetizer was not quite as flavorful a dish as I anticipated, but very good none the less. Also had the truffle and Parmesan potato chips, which are a MUST HAVE!!  The Bone in New York Strip was quite possibly the most flavorful steak I have had in a long time if not ever. The Service was spot on and the atmosphere was relaxed.

My mom, her boyfriend, my sister, and I ate here for a special occasion post-Phantom and there wasn't a single mentionable flaw in the experience. Everything was fresh, perfectly cooked to order, and tasted great. The service was attentive (though perhaps the tiniest bit slow toward the end of our meal) and friendly. \n\nThe ambiance was nice, excluding the "old ladies' night out" table nearby making a lot of drunken noise (they were just enjoying themselves but boy did one of them have a memorable cackle!) and would be suitable for a nice date.\n\nI recommend the caesar composed tableside as well as the tomato salads to begin with. I enjoyed my seared tuna and the steak and scallops I tasted were excellent, as was the tiramisu for dessert .	2	1	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	0vCffWO7AQKdZtoP_9ZTIA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

a0pTL79ML73Q2detlQQR1g	5	2015-08-27 00:00:00	I had the summer special petite ribeye, gumbo, smashed potatoes and vanilla ice cream for dessert. I also had a side of BBQ shrimp. Everything was amazing! This is definitely the best steak I've ever had. The BBQ shrimp are expertly prepared. I'd definitely recommend anyone eating here. I had eaten here back in 2002 and it was the best meal I had ever had, I was excited to return and see if it still was as great. It definitely was!  The service was the best we had all weekend. Such a great place to dine.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	GQWk8vgYGlN9hp0XP0V05w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
a2WRUnkjwjjfJC67uMQ29g	3	2008-08-12 00:00:00	Went here with some friends while my husband and I were having our couple's shower in Vegas prior to our wedding. His best man raved about the restaurant, so we decided to give it a go.\n\nWe made a reservation for the first seating, but they weren't quite ready for us when we got there, so we sat in the bar area and ordered a couple of drinks. I got a very good pino noir, though I can't recall where it was from.\n\nWhen it was time to be seated, we were escorted to our table through a line of wait staff. Honestly, it was a bit uncomfortable walking through all those people. Once we got to our table, our server came over and gave us menus. Both the server and her assistant were pleasant enough, though I don't know I would go as far as saying there were "friendly."\n\nWe all ordered our starters and make courses, plus a couple of sides. I got the lobster bisque, which I wasn't all that impressed with. I had better lobster bisque on cruise ship. It was a bit salty and the way they presented it was a bit tacky, in my opinion.\n\nWhen the entrees came, everything was fine. The steak was good, but I don't know that I would ever pay $50+ for it again. I asked for medium, and I got medium rare. Which was fine for me, but one of my friends had the same problem, and it kinda grossed her out. So she had to send it back. The server got the problem fixed very quickly, and it was perfect the second time around.\n\nI did like that they came with some sauces. The Bearnaise was very good and my husband devoured the peppercorn sauces. The sides were all good, but not as big as we had anticipated. Our waiter said they should feed 3-4 people. However, when you have two 250+ pound guys with you, it was not enough.\n\nThe desserts were FANTASTIC. I had the creme brule, which was perfect. Soft and creamy, with a yummy hard shell on the top. I would order that again in a heart beat. And we all felt the deserts were very reasonably priced for what we received. Definitely big enough for 2 people to share.\n\nOverall, 3 starts. Everything was good and probably would have gotten 4 stars, if not for the price of everything. When you pay that much for food, you expect to be wowed. And we just weren't. But no major complaints either.	6	1	6	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	rsVLySG9aB-i76nRhBQq8g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Service was good, my steak was good, and the little grilled cheese were good, but I honestly expected to be blown away.  It is Emeril after all!!!

A4n462mLrximfNPPebCSsw	4	2016-10-08 00:00:00	A first class steak house and pricey. Everything is a la carte. I ordered a glass of wine, the wedge salad, filet mignon and a twice baked potato and it was a little over $100. The filet was excellent. A couple  at my table ordered the Cesar salad for two and it was prepared table side, it looked so good! The only reason for not giving the restaurant a five star rating was the noise level. We arrived about 9:30 pm and it was a Friday night and there were many bachelor party tables. Having a casual conversation was difficult.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	zGipc5uOJrejX6KkUsSNpA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Sure it was great, the food was good the service was superb and the wine selection was almost too much to deal with, but its expensive.  hey its a fancy steakhouse in Vegas.  So it lives up to its name.  If you are looking for a great night out for steak this is as good a selection as any.  Just be prepared to pay about $100-$150/person if you are going to be on wine.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3gEk6-HQ7DxjY99zypqa8w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
A6iQKnF0Bqu0ThzsZG-X4A	4	2012-10-08 00:00:00	Came here with friends for our high end streak meal during a recent week in Vegas. It did not disappoint. For drinks, I ordered a High West rye Manhattan and it arrived perfectly mixed; maybe the smoothest Manhattan I've ever imbibed. Ceaser salad very good, but no anchovies. Two of us split chateaubriand and it was perfect, although presentation was somewhat boring. The potatos and asparagus were good but not spectacular. Another friend got the fillet and it was so tender she started cutting it with get butter knife and didn't even notice! The wine list is overwhelming. 93 pages. It's better to know what you want and see  if it's there than to try and choose. The decor is somewhat vanilla, but nice.  Also, the place is huge - much larger inside than what you see when you walk in off Restaurant Row in The Palazzo.  The crowd made for pretty fun people watching; there seemd to be a lot of middle aged men with their much younger "dates."  Maybe it was "take your niece to dinner" night.  But overall, a very nice, entertaining  evening out, but spendy.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	djtgPGGWQTuRh1kmRd5H3g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
a9RUQaht7oqSe132mR2cag	3	2012-05-24 00:00:00	We came here on a mission called "20-ounce Bone-In Ribeye". That is all we wanted.\n\nSo, we ordered the ribeye with mashed potatoes. We shared both over a few glasses of red wine. The steak is served with a glaze of butter worcestershire, bearnaise and chimichutri sauces. It was huge, beautifully cooked, and tasted good. It was missing one thing for me: SALT! My impression was that it had none. My BF said he liked it as it was. Don't get me wrong, it was a really good steak but it left me wanting more from the flavor spectrum. The potatoes were okay.\n\nService is always impeccable at Emeril's restaurants.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	8u9X-s7gkxaQz8Y7HazzoQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

aBCx4oWKVd6CQjxrBl_LfQ	4	2013-11-19 00:00:00	Having eaten here now a handful of times, I felt it was time to finally leave a review (not that they need it, based on their stars.) That having been said, it's really hard to go wrong with a steak here! The NY strip is huge, delicious, and, in my experience, cooked to perfection. The sides, while pretty standard fare, are quite good. I find the creamed spinach and mushrooms to be particularly noteworthy, while the asparagus was uninspired. The value is reasonable, in spite of the fairly high price, so no complaints there. With the number of great options in the Venetian/Palazzo, let alone in Las Vegas in its entirety, it can be hard to stand out, but Delmonico Steakhouse manages to do so.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	v7FS7-2WC167PioqePW3Qw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
abyg4eOIdxAZYI0AcDdaRw	4	2015-05-13 00:00:00	Well?  I stay at the Palazzo or Venetian a few times a year, and try to eat at DelMonico once a year.\n\nRecently went with a few coworkers, and a good friend of mine-  My liver.  We both waddled out feeling the need for a good workout...  But that would be for the next afternoon of course.\n\nFor starters, a Caesar.  Got to lay a good foundation.\n\nNext, why would the thick cut bacon NOT be chosen for an appetizer?  We each ate an order.  Ha.  Excellent.  Full already?\n\nOk.  A buddy of mine shared his bone-in Ribeye, medium rare, and it was done perfectly.  Firm, but marbled and juicy.\n\nI ate the lobster tail which must have weighed a pound.  The breadcrumbs were a nice touch, and I drizzled each bite with some butter.  Heavenly.\n\nYes, I'll be back.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2bJG8cm2QT4pJbzwiI2HoA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
aCfnliu5FVx9CKDTngG3CQ	5	2015-02-11 00:00:00	I'll start this review off for you skimmers out there that don't read long reviews. The bone-in rib-eye is the greatest steak experience you will ever have, hands down. Just eat it. Go. Do it.\n\nNow for you that are still with me, here's my full-on, cash money, baller review...for what it's worth:\n\nDelmonico must have a good database manager behind the scenes, because it had been a long time since my last dinner there (prob 5-6 years), yet they immediately greeted me and remembered my patronage (2 visits prior).  What a great feeling (and rather impressive to my gf) that the host and hostess and wait-staff greet you like you're a goddamn king touring the countryside. \n\nThis trip to Las Vegas was during a getaway weekend and to see long time friends, but we had a little dinner the night before some festivities for just us. I wanted to visit Delmonico again, because I had remembered such a positive experience with food and service the times before.\n\nSo we are greeted by the sommelier and our lead waiter, who throw out a few drinks and possible pairings, review the specials, roll over some changes in the menu (all from memory mind you). We knew we were eating steaks and heartier dishes, so we opted for a bottle of a good Sonoma Cab Sauv we recognized.  \n\nThe chef paid his compliments with an amuse bouche' of a olive oiled crustini with duck fat and a mushroom.  It was a delicious little oily, fatty, salty bite that told the taste buds "hey bitches...I'm comin' for you...get ready!"\n\nWe were treated to some hot brioche popovers and full-fat butter, and I had to oblige at least one...cannot say no...(it's completely un-American to pass up on such things).\n\nWe decided to start the evening by sharing an heirloom tomato and burrata cheese salad (faux caprese), and a table-side Lobster bisque. The salad was graciously split onto two plates for us, and was perfectly portioned with greens, veg, cheese, and a light dressing (that was not overpowering). The bisque was poured at our table with huge chunks of lobster, and a smooth velvet-like texture. Flavors were perfect and the temp was outstanding. I had mine and finished my gf's (she always worries about getting to full before the main meal comes).\n\nI had ordered the bone-in rib-eye au poivre and my lady chose the Filet Medallions. I must impress upon you again that the Bone-in Rib-eye IS the way to go. It is perfectly broiled at high temp, with amazing peppercorn seasoning and having it with the mushrooms sauce and onions is the bomb-sauce. There is nothing like it. It is a HUGE cut of meat, with great crusting outside, perfect marbling, and the bone-in flavor. The hot-reddish/pink medium to medium-rare center makes for a tender, juicy, and magnificent steak.  I honestly didn't even partake of her medallions much, because I didn't need to, and wouldn't cheat on my rib-eye.  I let the lady try some of mine and she immediately agreed its the best steak, anywhere, ever. We had a side of asparagus as well, which I felt very bad for because I gave it very little love. I hate leaving soldiers on the battlefield but I wanted to win the war with that steak and had a long night ahead of me of shows and clubs and didn't want terrible meat sweats...so I had to be courteous of tummy room.\n\nNow that we've effectively covered food, let me give a swag at the service. Top notch. All the way around. Polite, informed, friendly, attentive enough without being intrusive. Well-trained veteran folks throughout...no schmucks looking to hump tables as a side gig, these are true to form, real career servers who take pride in their appearance, their posture, plating, timing, knowledge, and truly love their career...these folks work years before graduating to a place like Delmonico or Craftsteak, etc. These guys get huge tips and get to work with fine chefs in multi-million dollar restaurants...they're the cream of the wait staff crop.\n\nTotal wine, apps, dinner (no dessert, saved room for later on) was what I expected at ~$300. Well worth it to treat ourselves and enjoy a top-notch meal.  \n\nLook folks, even if you're not an Emeril fan (yes he owns the Delmonico name), you can still love this place. A) he's no longer the executive chef of either location, B) the experience is always good here and the place stands alone on its merits, and C) that damned rib-eye is scheduled for my last meal on planet Earth (someday). \n\nTrust me folks...when in Vegas...eat like a damned king. Treat yourself to amazing service, amazing food, and good times...ENJOY!!	7	7	6	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3NnPbhmv_vEfPTBp2pnn9Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
aCob4vPeQnyL9umAufsSng	5	2014-06-08 00:00:00	Located at the Venetian Hotel and a Emeril Lagasse establishment. I made reservations for four persons BC our vendor wanted to treat us to dinner.\n\nWe started off with drinks at the beautiful bar and made our way to the plush dinning area. I started off with the gumbo which was superb. For dinner what better choice then the dry aged in house ribeye?  For sides we enjoyed garlic mushrooms, asparagus, NOLA creamed spinach and for dessert I savored the a entire Emeril's banana cream pie slice (it was huge and delish). My co worker from Phoenix enjoyed the bone in filet and he ended his meal with  key lime pie which he also raved about. \n\nThis was definitely a meal that was memorable and thank you to the entire staff at Delmonico Steakhouse. It's great knowing I can get a solid NOLA influenced meal with having to go to NOLA!	7	5	7	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	o4tYl3Hz0oDfpNn4k02DCw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The lobster bisque was smooth and rich. The sides we're all great as well. \n\nThe pricing was fair, it is a la carte steakhouse after all thats what you come to expect at an establishment like this. Service was just right, very attentive but at the same time the wait staff wasnt breathing down our neck.

Good not exceptional more to come...Finished dinner- still reminiscing about the bread pudding....its creamy, not to sweet, enough raisins, and ice on top- w/ pecan candied crunch- perfection.  the bone in rib eye is good- not the best I have ever had.  The reason being the ration of fat to meat was a little high- i do like marbled fat in the steak but when 1/3 of the steak is fat...i couldn't eat it w/o thinking of clogging my arteries.  Wine was exception- the Italy-"Vertigo" was yummy.  The best experience for me was spending it w/ my girl-riends esp for her 30th B-day! the service makes you feel grown up and independent!.

AGWpwTWuFvvviVek43VANA	4	2009-02-11 00:00:00	Quite delicious! I wouldn't say that this Steakhouse is creative or unique, but what I will say is that it's classic, delicious and savory. The decor is comfortable, quietly & minimally luxurious and the service was very good without being intruding. I was dining with my family (sister, mom, father and my husband Russ). \n\nFor an appetizer, I ordered the Lobster Bisque which was very good but not super memorable and for the entree, I ordered the Surf and Turf. Perfection. I found everything to be just as I ordered it and savored every last piece of my meal. We got the Bacon-Cheddar Polenta which was remarkably good and the mashed potatoes (which I didn't try) and also, the creamed spinach. It may not be revolutionary, but Delmonico's does good food just right :D\n\nI wouldn't say that I really "stepped out of my box" with what I ordered, but I will say that they have a wonderful wine list, a nice group of people working for them, and tasty food. This is the perfect place to dine with a small group or family where everyone can get something they like. It's more of a safe bet while dining in Vegas - but a good one. It's also located in the Venetian - which is as they say - a "feast for the eyes" I like!	6	3	5	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3_0ptS97yZndEHgmqN0M1w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I have been to CUT, SW, Craft, and Del Frisco's, but Delmonico's takes the cake. We went in a large (all male) group so I wont describe each dish, but simply give a brief overview. The service and decor are both wonderful. You were given a relatively large amount of space, at least for a steakhouse. The appetizers, steaks, sides, and desserts are great! A must go to for those looking for an upscale, but great steak dinner. In terms of price, it is average for a Vegas steakhouse.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Z3vY6CM1aSJcyDMrFfhPIw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

But everything to me here blew my mind. \n\nOne thing I want to mention is the level of service. I have never had such great service at any other restaurant than here. The food was served exactly at the same time by 4 servers, and they would refold your napkin if you were to step away from the table. I felt like I was treated like royalty. \n\nMy steak came out perfect.

I was feeling cheap and didn't want to spend a grip on dinner, but boy am I glad that I went and had the wonderful opportunity to eat at this fabulous restaurant with some dear friends of mine. \n\nFirst off, the ambiance is very simple, understated, and clean. Nothing overly done. In fact, I heard it was on purpose so that you can focus on the food and the people rather than the art and ambiance of the place.\n\nSecondly, service is top-notch. If you're paying the big bucks, it's no wonder. They totally spoil you here and answer all your silly questions!\n\nThirdly, ANYTHING you order off the menu will be delicious! We each ordered different items and tried each others plates and were blown away. You can't go wrong with anything you order!\n\nEverything was perfectly made and cooked very well and tender.

APnMYCYCi1zMOk5S_dXXqw	1	2013-03-25 00:00:00	Our bad experience started with the lady who answered when I called to set a resv. She sounded like she wasn't very happy and didn't make me feel good about planning to go to Delmonicos.  \nWe get there and the hostess simply said "follow me" she did not make eye contact or even ask "how's your evening?" She walked so fast to our table it was hard to keep up.  She sat us, gave us a napkin, said nothing at all, and walked away.  (Also they only have white napkins.. I'm used to fine dining where your napkin, either white or black, be offered to go with your ensemble.)\nNext, our server(s), didn't seem to care that we were dining there.  Not sure if they judged based on skin color, age, and style of clothes, but it felt like they did.  After offering us drinks and giving us menus, it was about an 8 to 10 minute wait to see our server again.. Mind you that we'd chosen what we'd have for dinner and had our menus closed a majority of that time.\nOverall for service from beginning til end was way below par for such a place.  We did not feel welcomed nor that they gave 2 funks about us.\nFOOD:\nMy bone in rib eye was ordered medium and came out medium well, which made it particularly dry and tough.  My spouses bone in rib eye was cooked correctly (medium), but was nothing to call home about.\nI ordered my steak Oscar style.  The asparagus was the highlight of our dinner and the crab seemed a but overlooked and dry.\nWe also had a lobster tail each, which came de-shelled and on top of the rib eye.  Drawn butter was brought out but lemon was not, nor offered.\nWe had the New Orleans style creamed spinach.. The only "new Orleans" about it was the name.  The spinach tasted fresh but it was about a 3.5/5 on overall taste and quality.\nFor the price there are many better options in Las Vegas (Mastro's ocean club; the capital grille, del frisco's..).  \nWe will surely never return.	1	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	o1Y7kEsQk6GaloUlLn3OOQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I thought Mesa Grill was good (and it is) but this hunk of cow takes the cake.  The ambiance is nice although the decor is a bit spartan, the wine list is far more than my gin-drinking brain could ever comprehend, and to top it all off the service was on another level:  There were like three dudes running around bringing us stuff and clearing plates all night.  And you wanna know about attention to detail?  The one thing Vegas has heretofore *never* gotten right was the after-dinner espresso.  Never hot enough, or no head of crema, or just awful tasting.  But Delmonico's brew was not only good tasting, but they actually warmed up the cup!

It pains me to admit this, but I stepped foot in the Venetian during my most recent Vegas trip :(  Just to clarify, this was NOT by choice, but by circumstance. Me, my boyfriend, and 2 other couples wanted to do a nice dinner. Long story short, one of the other couples raved about this restaurant and made dinner reservations for all of us. \n\nWith that being said, this steakhouse blew me away. It was surprisingly really good.  \n\n**APPETIZERS: I had the French Onion Soup and my boyfriend had a salad. The appetizers were so-so. We definitely could've have done without ordering them since our entrees and sides were filling.\n\n**ENTREES: My boyfriend and I each ordered the Bone in Ribeye. Had we known how HUGE they were, we would've just ordered one and shared. I was surprised at how good my steak was. I wanted to pull a "Fred Flinstone" and pick up the steak with my hands and gnaw on the entire thing.  My steak was prepared well, seasoned well, and tasted delicious. Even with all that deliciousness there was just so much meat that neither of us finished our steaks. \n\n**SIDES: We had the Creamed Corn Gratin & Potato Gratin. Both of which were creamy and delicious.  \n\nThe service was fine, the ambiance was nice, the steak and sides were fantastic. I'm just annoyed that this restaurant is located in the Venetian -_-	3	3	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	klHHSCnS585M05uACWK5nw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Absolutely no seasoning, bartender warned me that people complain about it having no spice... that was an understatement... now lets talk about the Lobster rolls... brioche buns are great, but when you pretoast them and leave them under a heat lamp it tends to ruin it. The mixture itself was bland.. again.. seems to be in the normal scheme of things.. anyway, after a monumental disappointing lunch, I'm gonna head to the room for a nap. 3 am came way too early!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	_RB-p8NGAdfLGW_rJd057w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

ATCuZ2OEpz5lAq0jmsoYNA	1	2014-02-25 00:00:00	We were very disappointed with Delmonicos steakhouse. I ordered my steak medium to medium rare and it was overcooked and burnt on the outside.  My fiancé's steak was also sub par. Our sides came out cold.  Dessert was just ok. The worst part was the bathroom- it was filthy and I was disgusted (garbage had overflowed all over the floor).  Definitely not worth the $300+ we paid.  We will not return.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	xVauCFhaLJo65LF_7UXyjQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

ATrZVN5ypcxsmr8_ysu1Ow	5	2010-03-21 00:00:00	I gave myself a few days before I wrote this review, to see if all the money I dropped on this dinner would be worth it. I've never spent so much on a dinner before, and so even with the glowing Yelp reviews, I went into this a little uneasy.\n\nMy boyfriend had paid for most of our Vegas trip, so I wanted to treat him to something special. This most definitely was.\n\nWe made reservations that morning (Thursday, so probably a slow night) for 7 pm. We arrived and were quickly seated. The decor was understated, with muted beige walls and plush brown leather chairs.\n\nThe service was impeccable. We had three waiters taking care of us! Water glasses never got more than half empty, and they were always ready to please. I asked where the women's room was, and the waiter led me there instead of just giving me directions. I really appreciated that, since the bathrooms were hidden away.\n\nLovely bathrooms though, but I expected that. A nice touch for the ladies was a basket of feminine supplies provided in case of emergency,\n\nBut now, to the main attraction: the food. Oh dear God, the food. We started with the truffle parmesan potato chips. So simple, but sooooo good.\n\nI got a rare filet mignon and the boyfriend got the bone-in rib eye medium rare. We got just one side, the cheddar bacon grits. They were good, but could have used more bacon. Then again, I think everything could use more bacon.\n\nThe meat was... quite literally the best I ever had. I love my steaks bloody, but my plate was clean until I cut into the steak. Chalk that up to a good sear and the excellent crust from the rub they use. It was kinda Cajun-y, but didn't overpower the glorious meat. It was allowed to prove itself as is and it was worth every penny.\n\nWe surprisingly still had room, so we went for dessert. I went for my old standby, the creme brulee. The boyfriend was intrigued by the root beer float with sarsaparilla sorbet. \n\nCan't screw up creme brulee, so no complaints. The sugar crust was thicker than expected, but the sweetness was offset by the chocolate shortbread cookies that came with it. Chocolatey, but not sweet. I could snack on them all day.\n\nBut the root beer float was a work of art. Came to the table in one of those tall sundae glasses, with the sarsaparilla sorbet on the bottom and vanilla ice cream on top. Waiter poured the bottle of root beer and left the rest for him.\n\nMy boyfriend is a root beer connoisseur. He used to make his own, so he knows his root beer. And he is still going crazy over that float. I think that speaks for itself.\n\nSo while at first I might have been apprehensive, I'm really glad we came here. It's out of our budget to do again anytime soon, but I definitely won't forget it.	1	0	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	obukhI570ZqM2kSvNoqtlw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
aUpAd0UpskT6Of1xZjEzzA	2	2010-05-06 00:00:00	I know I know.  The veg is only giving 2 stars to the steakhouse.\n\nI wanted to like it, I did.\n\nOn our girls-weekend to Vegas, one gal requested at least one nice steak dinner.  So we did some research and ended up here.  Seated promptly at our reservation time on a Friday night after sitting only a few minutes in their version of a waiting room.\nAs others have mentioned, when you order a steak ... that's what you get.  Not a piece of parsley to garnish, nothin' else is on that plate.  Our lil steak girl said her $45 steak was .... ok.  But, and I quote, she'd had a steak with more flavor at a certain Aussie steak chain.  Girl who ordered the chicken dish loved it and said it was worth the money.  The $9 side of mashed potatoes was yummy.  Little veg here ordered their vegetable plate (not on the menu, but when I asked what was available, our waiter offered this) and it cost me $30.  For grilled veggies - carrots, two types of onion, asparagus, and .... something else.  Not even squash!  A squash ravioli was on the menu, but not being served that night.\nLoud, no bathroom inside (have to walk around the corner in the casino), and there was NO decor to the place.  Maybe that's a style, but it ain't mine.\nThe wine list is waaay extensive, almost to a fault.\nService was overwhelming in that we had four separate waiters, but chaotic.  And it was 40 minutes from ordering to getting our food.\nLast complaint - if you have a nice restaurant, insist on some kind of basic dresscode.  I don't want to have spent time looking nice and then sit next to a table full of rednecks in Tasmanian Devil cartoon shirts.\nSorry, but it isn't worth the money for herbivores or carnivores.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	8jfGVLVliMyeUw2JoVWi2g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
aVLy_vp-BjxmDCW-aMWykQ	5	2009-01-08 00:00:00	i often refer to myself as Queen Cathy. Obnoxious, I know. But it's a nickname that's stuck since high school, and if that's what the people will, that's what I will be.\n\nBefitting the high standards and quality that this Queen has come to expect over the years, Las Vegas never fails to provide the top-notch EVERYTHING to entertain Queen Cathy's every whim and desire.\n\nDelmonico's. If I were the President of the US, I'd give you a Purple Heart. If I were the Queen of England, I'd grant you Knighthood.  As the Queen of CathyLand, however, I will give you the highest honor I can bestow: Five Stars on Yelp.\n\nOMFG this place is fantastic.  I'm a steakhouse junkie, and I am always looking for the next, even-better steakhouse experience.  My first visit to Delmonico's left me speechless, and all subsequent experiences have left me a raving addict.  No kidding.  if I ruled over Las Vegas, the land would see a very fat queen.\n\nThe service is IMPECCABLE.  I don't know how many people work here, but I've never seen my water glass less than half full (talk about food service taking a positive outlook on life! Haha).  It's like magic.  Before you even have a chance to THINK it, it happens on its own.  The food in an of itself is DELECTABLE.  I only order the boneless ribeye, as it's my absolute favorite cut (and I think the bone-in ribeye is their specialty).  It's flavorful, PERFECTLY seasoned, and absolutely perfectly cooked.\n\nYou see, this queen is picky.  She doesn't like to eat anything bloody. It's gross to her.  So she always ALWAYS gets her steaks well-done. While some may gasp in horror (how can you enjoy a steak WELL DONE?!), I say this, "It is true that well-done steaks tend to be dry and flat in flavor. If a steakhouse can manage to make my WELL-DONE steak juicy and flavorful, then FOR SURE it's a fantastic place!"\n\nI don't remember much about any of the sides because I'm always too busy gobbling up my steak (and still having leftovers to go!).  Many a late Las Vegas night, I'd drunkenly stumble back into my hotel room, and suddenly overcome by an urge to grub, grab my takeout box and just CHEW on a slab of leftover steak.  It's even good cold.\n\nDelmonico's, the Queen of CathyLand salutes you for outstanding service and incredible food. Cheers.	4	4	4	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Ygr_c6So7Aba0kDQW01FDQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We are from NY and have been to a lot of top notch steakhouses, so were really impressed by this restaurant.  Tom Baker made it even more memorable, great maitre d/waiter! I highly recommended Emeril's BBQ salmon and the bone-in fillet.  The real surprise were the truffle and parmesan potato chips - delicious!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	aP4BkNgP4wzQ5woQM-BI1A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

You really cannot go wrong with this place!\n\nBAM!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	oczri_IPWAVPYAsGlhrkBA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
aw_5aKHlAzV0PSM7F92YFw	5	2017-02-26 00:00:00	This place is top notch. We didn't order any appetizers as we wanted to make sure we had enough room to finish our steak. I mean that's the most important part of a steak house right? \n\nAlthough their cuts are bigger enough to split if you wanted to order a few apps and room but for us it was all steak type of night. Let's start with the ambiance it's self: like any other high end steak house very roomy and intimate setting. Lights are dim.  \n\nThe device was top notch we we greeted immediate as we sat, water came out, and wine list brought to us. It was my wife's bday so we were definitely having a glass. Their drink menu had several options of wine, cocktails, etc.  \n\nThe croissant that they bring out was fluffy and buttery. The knock is they bring you just one. I could have eaten 20. I'm sure if asked I could have had another. \n\nI ordered the bone in New York strip and I have to say it was by far the best strip I've ever had. My wife ordered the ribeye and I did try a bite. While tender and tasted well. It was slightly warmer on temp than she liked. My strip was better. But by no means was her's bad. The twice baked potato tasted awesome and we shared an order. The steak being so large we could barely eat the side. \n\nPrice point is similar to all other 4 star and up type of steak houses. It is definitely one I'd go back next time in Vegas.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3Y_gz3wb7T5ur9FHqxBcgQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I decided to eat the Wagyu and it came with mashed sweet potato. It was sooo good. Cooked awesomely by the chef. What made it even better was eating it with the many sides we ordered. Surprisingly I loved the cream of spinach, but my favorite side was the potato gratin. Unfortunately there are so many different places to eat in Vegas...I don't know if I'll ever get to come back here.\n\nDef need to try it at least once!	2	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	5Kax36yo5xPHb6yePptV9w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

And it was one of the best steaks I've ever consumed.  I seriously considered picking up the bone and gnawing on it to get more meat.

b10ABQhPyIj6hLB14BUZ2g	5	2013-11-24 00:00:00	Quite possibly, the best steak I ever had.  Went here with my wife and made sure I had reservations.  We were seated promptly upon arrival.  The rolls were delicious, as they are in all of Emeril's restaurants.  Ordered the Lobster Bisque soup, which was incredible.  The large pieces of lobster inside the soup just made it all that much better.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my wife ordered the filet.  Both steaks were cooked perfectly and were extremely tender.  We also enjoyed the twice baked potato with our meal.  For dessert, we had to have the Banana Cream Pie.  It was absolutely fabulous.  It had chocolate shavings drizzled on top and caramel sauce on the plate.  This is not your ordinary piece of pie.  It was absolutely heaven.  We had a fantastic meal, just like we have at Emeril's other restaurants.  The service was excellent and the staff was very friendly.	2	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Kw4lH6C5wSrYVxaDP68pfA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

They start off with croissant type rolls which were nice and light, followed with a small tea cup of tomato bisque, and then served your choice of a soup or salad. I ordered the lobster bisque which was exquisite, but someone else got the parmesan potato soup which they said was also exceptional. Most of our party got the filet, and everyone loved it. Lastly for dessert, I had a key lime pie all to myself and I almost ordered a second. Not too rich or heavy, and went perfect with a post-dinner coffee. Highly recommend, but very expensive.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	jAazHTXIY8MtCUWEMNbPJg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
b37phNyiI_PHlWAfPblTnA	2	2015-08-22 00:00:00	Had dinner here last week and I have one advice - Do NOT get the Prix Fix!!  We had the seafood tower, which was great except for the tuna tartare on the top - the tuna did not taste fresh at all.  Some of us got the summer prix fix option, which sounded like a great deal for $65.  All the appetizers were good, especially the tomato soup/grilled cheese.  Then the entrees came.  I had the petite ribeye, and it was seriously the worst steak I ever had.  It tasted like cheap top sirloin from Sizzler, really tough & chewy.  Emeril would be ashamed if he tasted it.  My daughter ordered off the regular menu and had the bone-in ribeye, which was delicious.  Maybe it was my fault for ordering the prix fix... I understand it's cheaper... but the quality was so poor and definitely no way near $65.  I'm giving them 2 stars for good appetizers but will be staying away from the prix fix menu.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	nCJQgSGMufccMfB0XJQBAg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

B5YFFW1UFRiTDq4qsGjYbw	4	2011-02-07 00:00:00	Just as good the second time around!  Near perfect steak dinner, but not perfect.\n\nThis place is worth a repeat visit.  I really have to compliment the wait staff at this restaurant.  It seemed like there were more workers than patrons the night we were there.  \n\nCaesar Salad - I was very tempted to order an appetizer, but my gf reminded me we were about to eat over a pound of meat so we decided to share the caesar salad.  It was prepared table side by our waiter.  It was decent and a nice way to prepare my stomach for the main course.\n\nBone-in Ribeye - Mine was cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  My particular cut was very, very tender.  My gf order the exact same steak and it wasn't nearly as good.  I had to share parts of my steak with her and we took the rest of hers to go.  Hers wasn't bad, it just wasn't as good as mine.  \n\nSides - We ordered the creamed corn and asparagus.   The corn was very good.  It had a nice crust on the top and went well with my steak.  The asparagus was pretty plain.  I had to throw salt and pepper on it otherwise it was completely tasteless.  \n\nDessert - We ordered the banana cream pie.  I have no idea why we chose it, but I'm glad we did.  I would have usually ordered something chocolaty with ice cream but the banana cream pie sounded good.  Well, it was good.  Really good.  When it came out, I thought it was going to be way too sweet with all the caramel and chocolate shavings, but it wasn't.  We weren't even hungry after our meal, but we managed to put the entire dessert down.  \n\nOverall, the food was good.  I have to give it 4 stars for the boring asparagus and inconsistent steak.  The wait staff was awesome.  They can have 5 stars.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	L6JEyaZLrUsfB5tDAWbo-Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

By far, one of the best steakhouses we have been to in Vegas. The servers were on point, and the food was out of this world. If anything please save room and have the oatmeal crusted pecan pie with praline ice cream. It may sound a little weird, but it was the best dessert I have ever had. And I eat a lot of dessert! It wasn't overly sweet, you get an individual pie of delicious goodness!

BCSepkFSm5VLmmx0CSCJLw	4	2012-01-17 00:00:00	Our group of 14 was staying at the Venetian and Delmonicos was our pick for a nice fancy dinner. Since we had a night full of drinking ahead of us, we definitely didn't want to over-stuff our stomachs so each couple agreed to share a steak along with lots of appetizers and sides. \n\nTo start off, some of us had the salmon and tuna tartare, wedged salad, baked oysters, french escargot, shrimp cocktail, and lobster bisque. They were all quite tasty! \n\nThe BF and I shared a Bone-in Ribeye. Asked for medium rare but it came out medium well. I was disappointed since I really hate eating well done meat. Luckily the flavoring itself was pretty delicious or I'd definitely have to have it recooked. I also had an addition of seared Foie Gras as well - which was the absolute BEST part of my meal. The flavoring and texture was perfect and after my last bite, I found myself wanting more still!\n\nAlong with our main entree, we had an order of almost every side they had listed on their dinner menu: buttered asparagus, buttered broccoli, creamed spinach, sauteed garlic mushrooms, mash potatoes, creamed corn gratinee, and potato gratin. All the sides are meant to be shared family style and a scoop of each was more than plentiful to compliment your main course. I loved the creamed corn the most. \n\nAs full I already was, I saw expresso creme brulee on their dessert menu so of course I couldn't pass up on that. Glad I didn't either bc it was fantastic!\n\nService was excellent and our three waiters were extremely attentive and helpful throughout our entire meal. Overall, we had a pleasant dining experience. \n\n3.5 stars because my steak came out medium well instead of medium rare, but because the service was superb, 4 stars it is! Next time, get my steak right please =)	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	mbp_UmBlhCeJXAqxoK6foA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I'm writing this review half a year after eating here so I don't remember specifics, but I do remember my scallops were very salty (but tender, and huge). What wasn't huge were certain cuts of steak, which basically came in a little cube. Service was amazing though, and the decor in clean, white, and perfect lighting. The inner dining area was better looking but empty at the time, I think they were trying to seat everyone to the outer sides of the restaurants first. Overall, I had a pleasant time but wasn't wow'ed by the flavors or bill. I'll still give Delmonico here in NYC a try though.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	-ipe4RBLU62yo_jHhEVttg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Steak was great, server described the seasoning and cooking process and it was on point. She also told us what was good and what was just average. Very knowledgable waitress. Drinks were solid. If you don't eat here you are missing out. Well worth the price.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	FG3G6_amIOW5wq0o5mDnZQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
BgSi0ppEnWSnfPiyX2hkng	3	2009-06-20 00:00:00	I thought that this steakhouse house would be an awesome meal being that it is an Emeril restaraunt and a fine dinning establisent in the Palazzo! I dont get how some people say this is the best steak they have ever had! They must either not get out much or believe the Outback Steakhouse is a fantastic place to get a steak. \n\nGreat waiters and staff that met your needs however the food doesn't compair! Now the unique style of your meal will be a delight in being the flavor of your steak or the style in which the meal is plated! I have eaten in many steakhouses and still yet nothing compares to Mastros, the ultimate steakhouse in the United States! I do give Emeril or the chef who cooked my steak credit in which the steak had an awesome flavor in every bite i took but still the meal is nothing more than average! I would give Delmonico's a 3 1/2 star!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	PTHCHcBhJbyNS3hMSQ2pYQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
BHfZGImmNKUKiDQ_JbkMgg	3	2017-02-26 00:00:00	This place was recommended by a friend and I was so excited to try it. I was highly disappointed. At their price point, I expect a certain level of service and food quality. Both were lacking. After getting seated, I had to request a black napkin, which is usually automatic. Not a big deal. After waiting for 5-10 mins, perusing the menu on our own, I had to ask a busboy to find the waiter so I could order drinks. He finally came over and asked if I had any questions and proceeded to recommend the entire menu. Not helpful. We ordered the organic green salad which was excellent. Also got the bone in ribeye. I liked the way it was charred on the outside but it was not well seasoned and the meat quality wasn't top notch like other steakhouses I've been to. The manager came by to do their customary check and I told him the steak was 'pretty good'. He didn't bother asking me why I wasn't satisfied, smiled and walked away.\n\nOverall, this place doesn't command the price they're charging. Need to clean up their service and food quality. If the salad was the best thing we ate at a steakhouse, that's definitely a problem.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	m2MeTI-cZ9G0sxgL8OG6eQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
bHMxqjTDchcYo8pqwrUYqQ	4	2006-09-14 00:00:00	I'm not a chaser of celebrity chefs...and wasn't excited to hit up Emerils joint in V-town. But I have to say. I was diggin' this place. \n\nThe atmosphere is pretty chill and classy. It made me want to sip cognac and smoke a cigar ( and I don't like either of those). This place definitely exudes a mid-western meets Palm Springs sort of vibe. You know... big comfy, light taupe leather chairs, with hearty dark wood tables and high nicely lit ceilings. \n\nMy food was good. The Foie Gras was amazing, the endive  salad was nice but not out of this world and the lamb special was good too. With very hearty servings of meat I couldn't finish my lamb, though if it were outrageously good I probably would have. \n\nAnd yes if offered to me, I sampled the dishes from around the table). Of note: the bone-in rib eye was very nice and the fondue was ridiculously good. I passed on the fish. (Come on Craig - who orders fish at a steakhouse?) Between the foie gras, fondue and lamb, it's amazing I walked out on my own. Never fear... red wine was there to save my ateries. (Whew! )\n\nWe passed on dessert. So no report there.\n\nWe sat a few tables away from D. Rodman. It's amazing how grown men in their 50's will say shout out stupid stuff like: "Yo D.R.? Can I get a Whoop Whoop?" when they're in the presence of an ex pro athlete. Funny stuff.	5	4	4	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	S765x0O9aI2e1ISaB-NYfQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

BKBXTJxnrxH2F7ACcooAuA	2	2016-03-03 00:00:00	My wife and I came here for our anniversary celebration last week. We had a show to attend at the Wynn so we needed to dine locally; I was debating on dining at CUT again or here but due to the high yelp reviews we decided to give Delmonico's a try.  I made reservations one month in advance online and notated our special occasion. \nUpon entry we were both promptly greeted, seated and our anniversary celebration was acknowledged - which was much appreciated. Service was kind, professional and very efficient but unfortunately the food - lacked significantly. \n\nWe both began with the recommended BBQ Shrimp appetizer - which was phenomenal, but unfortunately that's where our ecstasy of taste buds had ended.\n\nI ordered my long awaited alleged highly reviewed bone in rib eye with a side of foie gras, mashed potatoes and sautéed mushrooms. \n\nTo my unfortunate disappoint - the steak had tasted no different than a steak purchased from your local grocery store. For the price point and most importantly the anticipation I had for their signature steak from the world renowned chef, it DID NOT hit the spot. Although the steak came out at a perfect temperature and presentation was adequate, it did not at all taste like a typical dry aged high grade meat - very bland and mediocre, tasted no seasonings or flavor. We should have gone to Mastros or I would have at least been better off going back to CUT, although I didn't like the fact that CUT brings out their steaks lukewarm (due to resting) or not even on a hot plate - but you definitely get the high end meat quality and the explosion of flavors - hands down by far is 100% better.\n\nMy wife had ordered the Mediterranean Sea bass since she wasn't in the mood for steak and as well to her disappointment it was a lackluster, flavorless dish. All in all it was a very disheartening anniversary meal after a month's of high anticipation especially with all of the other fine dining options we had in Vegas.	2	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	mD-JAucjMeNnp50OnmAMtQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
BkC2tQ9vKei0Osn01BsI8Q	5	2008-10-03 00:00:00	I really enjoyed my experience in here. Its an expensive place so save it for a special night out, unless you're wealthy, than feel free to splurge all you want. \n\nFrom the outside, the restaurant seems small, but once you walk in you'll see its a lot bigger and most of their clients are seated there instead. Spacious seating and dim lighting, everyone is dressed up.\n\nMy party tried out:\n\nAppetizer: Emeril's shrimp, it wasn't bad. I was delicious, but not necessarily memorable or jaw dropping. Our waiter recommended it to us and it wasn't a bad choice.\n\nSoup: Lobster bisque, delicious!!! This is the best lobster bisque I've had in recent memory. A lot of the bisques I've had always added too much wine into so the wine flavor killed the lobster's, but this one was well balanced! Kudos!\n\nEntrees: BBQ Salmon, genuinely surprised at how delicious this was. Moist, flavorful, but not overbearing. Potato hash and onion strips went well with it. I ordered a side of mashed potatoes too, which was great. The waiter warned me that I had a lot of potatoes, but I don't mind. Plus, I shared my mash with my party. Other members in my party had the filet mignon and ribeye. I'm not a particular fan of ribeye because of its texture, but they managed to make me like it. \n\nWe didn't order any dessert, but we did have a few cups of Blue Mountain to end the evening. Soothing, relaxing, and it was a perfect ending to a nice meal.\n\nThe service was great, our waiter was very efficient, honest, and attentive. No snobby elitist attitude, which is always appreciated. The price is expensive, but what do you expect? Its Vegas! You're going to be spending a lot if you want to have a good time here.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	9RYD5m8xUb5la2wGsf30_A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The bread and butter was both cold.boo. The lobster soup was salty.eh. The barbecue shrimp is good. The rib-eye was really fatty. eh. The strip steak was yummy! The portions are big too.

bnXTqzca48MVNjDioT4OVA	5	2009-06-30 00:00:00	Loved it! Went to Delmonico Steakhouse a few days ago with a group of friends, and absolutley loved the food and the service. \n\nThe Service:  The service was impeccable.  I've seen better (well only one other place could beat their service) but Delmonico put Ruth's Chris and Mortons to SHAME. Yes, I said it... to shame.  That's how great they are. Drank one inch of water, and was immediately refilled with another inch.  Drank one inch of wine, and was immediately refilled.  Food was brought on very reasonable time.  Though if I could complain, I would've wanted the staff to be a little more friendlier.  Felt they were being a little less friendly because of our age.  But I'll let it slide.\n\nThe food: I can complain NOTHING about the food! The food was fantastic.  The best steak I've ever ate, hands down! Was worth every penny (or should I say dollar).  Even the baked potato was super good (and it's just a regular baked potato!) Its as good as it gets.\n\nI would highly recommend this place for a business meeting or a date.  It's just a wonderful eating experience.  Would definitely come back again, Emeril did not disappoint!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	rE5Ye71tkVEs1BMsZcyBPw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
BOaqIje27ZaQ7ymbEaMPGQ	4	2010-05-24 00:00:00	This is my 3rd visit to Delmonico and unfortunately I have to lowered my rating.\n\nThis is mainly for the service. You would imagine a fine dining establishment like Delmonico would give you top notch service when you're there, it was average at best.\n\nI ordered a glass of wine, the bone in rib eye, the bone in new york, cream of corn, and a twice baked potato. The server kept insisting we add an appetizer and a half bottle of wine to our order. I know its their job to encourage customers to order more, but I had a sense the server felt like I wasn't spending enough to justify exceptional service.\n\nThis may be a pet-peeve of mine, but I hate it when the server doesn't bring you the bill nor does he bring you back the bill after you paid. The runner did this. The runner also was the one who asked if I would like dessert. I know its a busy restaurant, but the server could have brought back the bill and asked if I enjoyed everything (what if something was wrong?). Again this is a pet-peeve of mine.\n\nRatings for the food:\n\nBone in Rib Eye: 5/5 stars\nBone in New York: 4/5 stars\nCream of Corn: 5 stars\nTwice Baked Potato: 4/5 stars\nRegular Idaho Potato (from a previous stay): 3/5 stars\nCalamari (from a previous stay): 3/5 stars\nDinner Rolls: 5/5 stars	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Hb6LUSM-JH5JV5jV3GqVoQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

bqKQx_p5iH3qbaUhW255yA	4	2014-03-26 00:00:00	This is has been on my list for a while, so it was one of my first choices for Spring Restaurant Week this year. I came here for lunch during the week with fellow Yelpers and we took advantage of their $30.14 prie fixe menu (Three Square $4 donation). I also utilized Open Table to make my reservation.\n\nThe three of us started with the Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad for our appetizer. The fresh heirloom tomatoes (2-3 different types/colors) were served with a dollop of creamy Burrata cheese, red onion, extra virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and fresh local basil. Really crisp and refreshing; great start to our meal.\n\nFor the entrée, I selected the Delmonico's Prime Hamburger served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese, crispy bacon, and the usual fixings (lettuce, tomato, onion). It was perfectly medium rare with juices oozing out with every squeeze. The burger had great flavor and seasoning, so that made it stand out from other burgers I've had. It was also an extremely generous portion. I could barely finish half of it (and I eat A LOT). My only complaint was that although the burger started out juicy and delicious, it dried out really quickly and made it almost difficult to eat. I'm not sure what attributed to this, but it was odd. The fries were delicious! A unique preparation of crispiness.\n\nI also had the opportunity to taste the Butternut Squash Ravioli prepared with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts, and parmesan cheese and Pan Roasted Atlantic Salmon served with a sweet corn and crab vinaigrette and fresh basil. Both were really delicious! The salmon was so soft with a succulent rareness in the center of the filet. I was also really impressed with the large chunks of crab meat and whole kernels of corn.\n\nFor dessert, I opted for the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Bread Pudding with Vanilla Bean Crème Anglaise. I'm glad someone else chose Emeril's Banana Cream Pie because it was a tough decision for me (both being my favorite desserts). The bread pudding was moist, warm, and very yummy. The pecan caramel-like sauce was a bit sweet, but fortunately, the pudding was not. The banana cream pie was topped with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. Yum. It was good, but I'll have to order one in the future to get a really good taste of it.\n\nThe restaurant is nice and I like the dimly lit rooms with spotlights on each table. It wasn't very busy during our meal, but I'm sure it would still be that nice and quiet. The service was also phenomenal. I was extremely pleased with the offering of Harney & Sons tea (transported in the most gorgeous wooden box display) and the fact that it was complimentary. Everyone was so prompt to refill my pot with hot water and of course, it was served with fresh lemon and honey. We also stayed past their lunch service and they were so kind to allow us to loiter for that long.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
BQXUoy7pgmLoQGEKk5duEA	5	2011-03-22 00:00:00	I came here back in 2005 with my family and had a phenomenally memorable meal. Six years later -- I came back this past weekend and it was STELLAR. Extensive wine list, excellent service, ridiculously buttery brioche bread, great cocktails, and of course, the food!\n\nFor apps, my party had the truffle chips (so rich but delish!), squash ravioli with duck confit (superb), lobster bisque (mmm with large lobster chunks), and the wedge salad (as perfect as a classic wedge gets). \n\nFor entrees, I had the filet mignon that was PERFECTLY cooked to a true medium-rare. I often find that, when I order med-rare, more often than not, highly rated restaurants overcook my meat to more of a med to med-well, which is can be disappointing. Well, here at Delmonico, it was PERFECT! Friends got the bone-in ribeye and the huge $85 Fred Flinstone steak (I forget the official name), all cooked to perfection. The 2007 Joseph Phelps Cab paired divinely with the steaks. \n\nSides:  creamed corn was mind-blowing; creamed spinach was good but didn't knock my socks off (compared to everything else which did). \n\nWe were too stuffed to order a dessert, but we received a complimentary birthday gelato. Nice gesture, but it was not so great -- I think it was a non-conventional flavor, like fennel or something?\n\nOverall, I would definitely return the next time I'm in the mood for a (pricey) steak dinner in Vegas!!!

brGiY3zMcOtyIGTN92BZzA	3	2015-08-29 00:00:00	Food amazing, mushrooms and Rack of lamb were excellent. Truffle chips so addicting! I had made an advance reservation and made a comment that it was my boyfriends birthday and asked for a special table. When we arrived the hostess seated us at a table 2 feet from other guests on one side and up against a wall on the other side. When I asked her if they had a nicer table she said that the dining room was full. Then she looked around and asked what table I wanted. I told her that I had requested a nice cozy table when I made my reservation. I was disappointed in the location of the table especially since I had made that specific request. She then moved us to a table that was right next to the entrance and sound volume buttons/lighting controls of the restaurant. It also was not what I expected but at least we weren't right next to another group. Throughout dinner the managers were constantly walking by and playing with the volume buttons and lighting buttons on the wall. On a good note , our server and the food was exceptional however I have been to several fine dining restaurants and was disappointing that my small request was not granted. It's the little things that make a difference.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	l31uOLHpOVVY0a5ayUCTXA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I have to say something about the décor - it was too plain and sterile and I expected a little more character from this establishment.  I would have added some wood paneling or some framed mirrors.  But the food was worth it.  We ordered the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp, Butternut Squash Ravioli, Traditional New Orleans Gumbo, and of course the 16 oz Rib Eye steak.  Our side dishes included the Country Smashed Potato, Delmonico Creamed Spinach, Buttered Fresh Asparagus, and Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms.  All the dishes we ordered were delicious.  Our steak was medium rare and it was sooo good.  The meat was tender with the right amount of fatty goodness.  My favorite sides were the asparagus (cooked just right, not over or under cooked) and the mushrooms.  The creamed spinach was a little too salty for me.  They added a nice touch to my birthday by serving complimentary appetizer and dessert (mango sorbet)	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Lgmfl_A0cy72dwZfbuh9Tg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Its either I had high expectations but other than enjoying the bread, their steaks and lobster bisque was little on the salty side (and I enjoy salty). Their salmon with the chorizo hash was pretty acceptable....but they are a steakhouse, so I expected more from their steaks!

bUJ7-Q6jzcJsI6o-o72Q7w	4	2009-04-03 00:00:00	The steakhouse is like most traditional steakhouses. The decor was very clean and contemporary. The hostesses weren't all that attractive and would rate about a 5-6 in my scale of looks and their demeanor looked as if they did not really care to be there at all. \n\nThe dining area is half filled with patrons and business people alike chatting away about their day and how excellent the steak was prepared The beautiful burgundy high leather chairs is a nice touch and their seating area is plush and soft. The booth seating is a high suede sofa like seating and the tables were all lined with clean white linens and set in standard of most fine dining establishments. \n\nI took my seat and I was greeted by the waiter and the captain and was asked about my choice of entree. I decided to go with their Filet Mignon and go with my good instincts that this would be the best choice. The chef prepared all the appetizers for a sampling. Classic jumbo shrimp cocktail, Parmesan truffle chips, classic Caesar salad, fried calamari, and mixed green salad. \n\nThe classic jumbo shrimp cocktail with a extremely spicy cocktail sauce wasn't as good as I expected. The shrimp were cooked well and the shrimp were presented beautifully, however, the spicy cocktail sauce did not please my taste buds or my nostrils for that matter. The sauce was like eating a handful of Wasabi.\n\n The extremely addicting truffle Parmesan chips were EXCELLENT and should be ordered every time any patron enters this restaurant. The chips were drizzled with truffle oils and shaved Parmesan cheese and each individual chip melted as you put them in your mouth. \n\nThe classic Caesar salad had much to desire. The way the salad was prepared was not my idea of a good salad. It was literally a huge chunk of romaine lettuce with the heart in tact served with a plain and unappealing Caesar dressing. I don't like how fancy restaurants can slap a big chunk of romaine lettuce on a plate and call it a classic Caesar salad just to be different. Don't mess with a good thing!\n\nThe fried calamari was ok at best, not my favorite but definitely worth a taste. The mixed green salad was a way a salad should be prepared and had just the right amount of dressing. The waiter was attentive and knew what drinks were ordered. The plates were cleared but seemed like sometimes dead plates were left around. Not a good sign of service. \n\nThe entree finally came and the presentation could have been better but the Filet was ammmmazing. The steak knife cut through the Filet like a butter knife through room temperature butter. The steak was cooked to medium rare perfectly and encrusted with some New Orleans style spices. I truly enjoyed the Filet till the very last bite. One thing I do have to mention is the dessert. I would highly recommend the famous Emeril's banana cake. This thing was pure heaven and was absolutely delicious. I could not even describe it in words if I even tried so I won't! So you will have to try it for yourself. \n\nOverall the experience was good, food was good but not the best I have tried, and the service was ok by my standards, but my standards can be high. My favorite parts were the Filet and the dessert, the appetizers once again could have been better with the exception of the truffle chips, mmm! delicious! I would recommend this place for dinner or lunch, however, the price can be a little daunting. I was calculating the totals of a appetizer, entree, and dessert and was estimating about 70-100 dollars a person with tip. That can look a little scary for some people, but for the meal and experience I'd say that was definitely worth it! Many thanks for reading.

Lunch menu was great however my steak was over cooked. \n\nWhere's the porterhouse steaks???\n\nWine was good but little expensive, even for Vegas.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	dSD4g9vgdjnjJTf55QOcPQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

My daughter & my husband shared the Chateaubriand with asparagus & mashed potatoes, and I ordered the Filet Mignon Au Poivre which was wonderful... Starters equalled Lobster Bisque & Butternut Squash Ravioli which were excellent as well...

c08tYtxNVzdcLn-_tS_NEA	4	2012-04-21 00:00:00	Delmonico is another place that I've eaten at a number of times (over a span of close to 10 years), and it is always consistently fantastic.  The food, especially the steak, is always wonderful; however, the menu does not change often.  Thankfully, with items like the gumbo on the list, the stale menu isn't as big a problem as it could be at other fine dining establishments.  As you would expect, the steaks are incredible, and Delmonico is home to my favorite filet in Vegas.  The dessert leave a bit to be desired, but I am generally way to full to be bothered with dessert anyways.\n\nThe service here can be hit and miss, and it seems to depend on where in the restaurant you are seated - up front by the entrance and you're being hounded by a swarm of waiters, runners, and sommeliers, while if you're seated toward the back of the restaurent, you tend to be a bit underserved.  The atmosphere is definitely a bit stuffy, but that doesn't stop the occasional jackass in a football jersey or cowboy hat from sitting down at the table next to you.  \n\nOverall a great restaurant, however I would recommend Table 10 in the Palazzo.  Table 10, another Emeril establishment, is far less stuffy and has a very similar menu and food quality, at about two-thirds the cost of Delmonico.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	rqPYO5YZ67VGgkZXAHgw7Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
c0PL2SjEXjEOpx4xKHqLZw	3	2014-07-01 00:00:00	A-okay! Was at this restaurant this past Saturday for a bday dinner. \n\nThe atmosphere was cool and what you'd expect from a high end steakhouse. However it is located in the Venetian hotel which has seriously gone downhill from the last time I was there (maybe '05-'06).\n\nService was great, and friendly too. However the food was ehhh, on the border of "ok." I ordered a filet cooked medium, but I got well (even burnt along edges). My bf ordered the ribeye cooked medium, and he got a true medium - a little pink inside, nicely cooked outside & edges. Our table shared mushrooms (wouldn't recommend, bland), country mashed and au gratin potatoes (both ok), corn (tasty!), and creamed spinach... Only thing was, we never got it. I think we were so busy eating and talking that we didn't realize it till afterwards. I guess it happens.\n\nSo all in all, this place is ok. It doesn't rank above the norm, nor would I drag it down... It's a middle of the road type steakhouse. With so many amazing options in Las Vegas, I'd recommend you try another one before here (STK, Chef Ramsey's).	1	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Sf6rYBXK_4OHu21OXuBe_g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

C3yUigxsMXowga1aKoCu4Q	1	2015-07-01 00:00:00	AWEFUL bone-in ribeye. AVERAGE/BLAND/DRY au-gratin potatoes. GOOD lobster bisque.\nBoth mine and my husband's rib-eyes were gristly and fatty (neither had marbling that is found in good cuts of meat). About 25% to 30% of our steaks were gristle and fat, which we left on our plates. We both thought the seasoning was boring, but we know that's a matter of preference. \nWe eat at nice steakhouses (Del Frisco's, Ruth's Chris, Brook's, Morton's, Elway's, Shannahan's) a couple of times a year, so we think we know about quality steak. Our steak and au-gratin potatoes were something a casual dining restaurant like Chili's or Applebee's would serve.\nStaff was pleasant.\nOur demogs: mid-40's, professionally employed, live in Colorado.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	SP-QU8T97xRT1NSuV8OxVw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

c8lo86VuPuqXs-U8DvmdOA	5	2016-10-06 00:00:00	This has to be the best steakhouse i have ever been to in my life. I would recommend anybody who is dining at the strip to try this once. This is a great steakhouse, reservations are a must as we went at 5pm on a Thursday and they were pretty much full and they open at 5. \n\nThe restaurant is right next to the theaters in between the Venetian and palazzo. The place is huge and the service is excellent.\n\nWe ordered the chateaubriand steak for two which was 18oz and they carved the steak and cooked it to perfection right on tableside. We also got the mashed potatoes along with creamy spinach for the sides but just the steak alone was so tasty you don't really bother with the sides even though we did. \n\nThe server was super professional and from start to finish they crushed it and made sure we enjoyed the dinner.\n\n5 stars all the way. This is the restaurant which deserves more as lots of places get the 5 star rating. Delmonico should open up a place in South Florida so i don't have to go to Vegas just to enjoy a steak, just a suggestion.	9	7	9	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	unfMni6NMuWKF6AC0XdTLQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

c9lAv_pZYK6r1umrzAhnVA	2	2017-03-27 00:00:00	Rib eye steak for $51 should be pretty darn good.  What I got was not as tender and not as flavorful as the rib eye served by our local Texas Roadhouse.  And, of course almost three times the cost.  Actually, more than three times the cost, since the entrée comes all by itself, and you pay separately for any sides.  My wife's pork chop was huge, but virtually raw in the center.  The server explained to us that this was the "correct" way to serve pork nowadays.  Apparently we're behind the times, because we prefer not to eat raw pork.  She did enjoy the part of the chop that was cooked, though.  By the way, my steak was a bit more than lukewarm.  I kind of like steak that's hot.\n\nThe restaurant was very loud, and became substantially noisier as the table of eight drunks behind us got more and more drunk.  Shouting, screaming, maniacal laughter filled the section of the restaurant where we, unfortunately, were seated near them.  No one from the Delmonico's staff or management did anything to ameliorate this situation, and the drunks stayed (and got louder) long after they had finished eating.  But not finished drinking.\n\nThis is one of those steak houses where there's a primary server and then a team of two or three ancillary servers.  None of them were initially friendly, although the primary server warmed up a bit.  The others came and went almost instantaneously, with minimal contact.  For example, one server brought a couple of small popovers for each of us.  Almost tossing them onto plates, he muttered "Enjoy your bread" -- and was gone.  A small magic act, more impressive than the food.\n\nI really can't think of any reason for us to go back, and would not recommend this place to anyone.  But your mileage may vary.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3RGKgFproU4CflJVkAZw4w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
CA-TNm0XSrp0tWXcHil8uA	4	2011-06-22 00:00:00	I usually love Delmonicos but my last trip kept me wanting more. Maybe I was too hungover to thoroughly enjoy my meal, but on this blurry Saturday night everything was very mediocre for me. We started off with the steak tartare and the bbq shrimp. The steak tartare was very good. It was fresh, clean and delicious. The bbq shrimp was good, but for $18 for 4 shrimps, I wanted them to be a party in my mouth, and in this case, they were not. I ordered a medium rare rib eye. It was cooked to absolute perfection. Nice crust and juicy pink center. I marveled at the perfection of my steak. Although it was slightly under seasoned it was still juicy and delicious.\n\nDelmonico's is probably one of the best if not thee best steakhouses I've been to. Their service is spectacular and on point every time I've been. They really do hire the best of the best. Attentive but not overbearing servers.  Delmonicos puts out some amazing and good quality food. If you go, you must try their lobster bisque, it's luscious, creamy and definitely worth the calories. Potato gratin is definitely one of their best sides also. And of course, don't every steer from what you came for, the STEAK!\n\nEmeril, you slightly let me down this time, but I still remember how good you've been to me the last times. I'll be back to let you redeem yourself.	7	3	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	B9lDn4yYQrazBbAeb4Zn5w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
caARHnBdSHpXiojL4K626Q	3	2013-02-10 00:00:00	I had dinner here on 2/7.  The last time I was here was over 10 years ago.  The last Vegas steakhouse that I had eaten at was CUT, so that is what I will be comparing my experience to.\nService:  Very Good.  We had at least 3-4 servers taking care of us (party of 5) throughout the night.  Initially dinner was for a party of 4.  However, once we were seated, our buddy landed at the airport and decided to join us.  I informed the head server (thinking that they may not be able to accommodate) and he immediately converted the table to seat 5 (pulled out stuff from the bottom to make it a round table).  Water was constantly filled and table cleared off in appropriate fashion.\nFood:  We started off with the Caesar Salad and Ahi Tuna/Salmon tartare.  I thought the salad was just ok.  A tad too much dressing.  Same with the tartare.  Nothing special and pretty bland.  Most of the group got the bone in rib eye (medium rare to medium well).  All were cooked well.  I thought the medium rare tasty pretty good.  Nothing spectacular about it, just good steak.  I had the rack of lamb (medium rare) and it had decent flavors.  I would take Carvino's lamb chops over it any day.  The sides we had were decent (Potato gratin, mushrooms, and corn).  We had a nice bottle of wine that the Sommelier recommended with a price point of $85.  That was probably the best tasting thing of the night.\nThe verdict on Delmonico's is that it is a decent steakhouse that it's reputation is based on its name more than its food.  I would choose CUT over it any day.  They have more selection of meat (cuts and quality).	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	pJUzdorsC5BpC3q5ECi4Lg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
CagzRGEWBXCDu4GHCVSMgQ	4	2007-08-15 00:00:00	Why you ask is a vegan giving a steakhouse 4 stars? Actually, why is a vegan even going to a steakhouse at all? Because she's probably adopted and the preferred twin was given the luxury of choosing the restaurant for the night. Sometimes I dream of the green parents that celebrated every monumental event at Cafe Gratitude and unfortunately had to leave me behind. In Concord. Either way-my family is screwed up.\n\nBack to Delmonico's, this is actually my second visit, first time was in 2000. Even then they accommodated my needs. Now they actually have a vegetarian option but alas, no vegan dish. \n\nNo problem-when you've so obviously been dragged along to a place with a bunch of meat eaters, people sometimes take pity on you. It's kind of fun to tell people what you absolutely will not tolerate and see what they give you. Dating should be more like this but that's another review. I was served pasta with different veggies like asparagus and green beans. Not amazing but not bad. An A for effort.\n\nI should probably mention the dead animals that Delmonico's specializes in. Yes-they're dead. But my family loved what they ordered and sucked the bones dry.\n\nExcellent service and the bartender made a tasty kir royal.	3	10	6	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	H8afsanrRlTa5aPwE-QlGg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
cAmyvxdZ68EPDJKTLsf03Q	5	2015-01-18 00:00:00	This place is amazing!!!! Came here for an annual post-Christmas celebratory dinner and we were pleased with the food as well as the service. They served us a complimentary tomato mousse on a puff pastry to start and for being a single bite, it was packed full of flavor! I knew we were in for a treat. Ordered steak tartare for an appetizer and fell in love. It comes with an egg yolk over the top which gives it a wonderful velvety taste. Decent portion although I could have eaten much more. Next we shared the tomato and burrata salad. The burrata was the best I've had....so creamy and rich. Delicious! For our entree, we shared the Chateaubriand. Holy crap was it amazing! The first bite literally melted in my mouth. It's served with asparagus which was super fresh and crisp. We substituted fingerling potatoes for the mashed potatoes and were very happy with our decision. We also added foie gras, which was delicious. I seriously could eat the steak ever day though.... It's one of the best I've ever had. For dessert, we were interested in the bread pudding but went with the suggestion of 2 different servers and ordered the pecan pie. Holy shit it was incredible. Not your typical pecan pie....it's made with oats and love and magic. It was the perfect end to a fantastic meal. We come to Vegas and splurge on a nice dinner once a year, typically going somewhere new each time, but there's a chance we'll make a repeat visit next year. The service was on point throughout...the staff is knowledgeable and friendly, not stuffy or arrogant at all like some places.

Not impressed one bit.\nI don't understand how this restaurant received such high ratings, but I certainly would not go back nor would I recommend to anyone.\nFrom the food, the service, the ambiance - huge let down.\n\nI would've given this place an additional star if the service wasn't so terrible.  The server was slow and was more interested in chatting.  Also, we waited at least 30 min to get our entrees(they didn't even seem busy). \nAfter our table was cleared from apps and salads, we waited 20+ min before calling our server to check up on our food. She said it was still within the "window" and she couldn't do anything. Luckily, she spoke to her manager after another 5-10 min because that's when our food was "officially late." \n\nWhat we had (from what I can recall):\nBBQ Shrimp - shrimps were cooked unevenly and drowned in mediocre BBQ sauce. Some were cooked well, but mine was under. \nVine-Ripened Tomato Salad - nothing special\nBaked Crab Stuffed Lobster - lobster tail cooked well, but tough to eat and nothing amazing\nNY Strip - no flavor\nFilet - nice crust from the Essence stuff\nSauteed Garlic Mushrooms - standard\nPotato Gratin - bit on the dry side\nCreamed Corn Gratin - best side order we had on the table, but that doesn't mean much.\n\nDessert:\nSorbet, banana cream pie, apple fritters, key lime pie.\nThe desserts and our bottle of wine were probably the highlight of this dinner.\n\nIf you are looking for a good steakhouse on the strip, this is NOT the place.\nYou'll probably have better luck at Mastro's, Stripsteak, Prime, or Craftsteak.	0	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	MDBfbX9z_D2YM7BnUfdZYQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

And I wasn't disappointed. \n\nMy prime rib-eye steak was cooked perfectly (mid-rare), seasoning was spot on and your steak wont be distracted by a pool of butter.\nTry topping it with a generous piece of Foie Gras if you don't mind the occasional stoppage of the heart.\n\nUnlike alot of other steakhouse where you feel cramped, and surrounded by ear deafening drunks, at Delmonico the ceiling is high, tables are placed with room to run around (not recommended). And you have ample room to stretch your stomach and legs while not eavesdropping on the other table's encounter with "girls directly to your room".\n\nI would love to give Delmonico 5-stars, however, their sides had a lackluster performance. A little adventure wouldn't hurt, it is Vegas afterall.\n\nSo my quest continues with N9NE and Stripsteak coming up in a month.

I would rate it in better than a ruth chris, ditka's, chop house and in the same category as a shula's or capitol grill.\n\nThe service is 5* as they have 3+ waiters taking care of you constantly, but not overbearing. Type of place where you leave to use the washroom and you  come back to the table and with a folded napkin and a refilled water glass.\n\nLove the appetizers, my wife believes it they have the best lobster bisque soup out there.\n\nThe steak's are great sizes and range from $42-$50, but you're truly getting what you pay for. For the dolts who dinged this place because of the cost, if you want a piece of grizzle for $20 then go to outback.\n\nWhenever my wife and I come to vegas and we need to celebrate something, this is the restaurant we do it at.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A4GnBOU7ZCTcoQK4e1s6ug	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Cesf2GqLK5GZl5Nz5d4pcQ	5	2012-11-10 00:00:00	The bone-in rib eye is easily the highlight of this steakhouse. The medium rare steak had excellent flavor along with the marbled fat that simply melted in my mouth. The oysters, ahi tuna & salmon tartare, butternut squash ravioli, and bbq shrimp are all excellent choices for starters and the potato gratin is a good side dish to have the steak with. The wine list is very extensive, but if you're not up for all that intensive reading, they also have a very knowledgeable staff to make recommendations. I was a little disappointed with peppermint profiteroles which were a little too stiff for my liking. Service was great and efficient. I must have had my water glass filled 7-8 times that night. Pricing is relatively decent - entrees around $50 and starters/sides/deserts around $10-$15 each.	2	2	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	9C1SWMuPxF1CoVDF16Z7pw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

cfe_IsSmE-NBFksEp79Aqw	4	2008-02-24 00:00:00	I was so impressed with the sister restaurant in New Orleans that I opted to make a reservation here for hubby's bday.  We arrived an hour early for our reservation and they were able to seat us.  They sent over a complimentary amuse bouche of steak sate that wowed us while we enjoyed an outstanding Pomegranite Martini and Key Lime Martini.  For people who love wine, the menu is extensive and expensive.  Overall, the food was good (don't order the creamed spinach, it tastes like Birds' Eye frozen), and the service was excellent (thanks, George!).  Pricey, but knew that heading in, and the cuts of meat and preparation met were worth the $$$$ price.  The special salad that evening (mixed baby greens with lavendar and baby brie turnovers and candied pecans was much better than my proscioutto (chewy slab, not shaved) and mozzarella.  A nice place for a special dinner.  Overall I have to say I enjoyed the food at the NOLA location but liked the sophisticated atmosphere and vibe of this Venetian restaurant better.  Glad we went but next time I'm in Vegas not sure I wouldn't head back without trying another similar restaurant first.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	XO1D-qihZwWmbci6nXbeeQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We walked in and were warmly greeted by the hostesses and seated quickly in the beautiful dining room of classic romantic design. Our table was impeccably set with china banded in red, trimmed in gold, similar to that of the GW Bush era at the White House. We had a friendly, attentive staff of four serving us our Chateaubriand, sauteed tableside, that was so tender and done to perfection the knives we were given surely were for decoration - we did not need to use them. I highly recommend this dining experience if you are interested in a romantic, classic setting with a menu and wine list fit for the king and queen that you are :) Do give the Duck Egg Creme Brulee' a try - it was marvelous!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	eW7_Tcd08Nw6haPdVBpE4A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I ate dinner at the bar, where a full menu is available.  Overall the meal was very good:  very good foie gras; an excellent bone-in rib eye steak with three sauces (barnaise, A-OK [like a fancy version of A-1], and a third sauce that I liked but can't remember anything about); bananas Foster ice cream pie that was good but not to die for.  A number of wines are available by the glass.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
CgAMejWWefRGG2LxKMC79Q	4	2009-03-18 00:00:00	I came here for my 20th birthday just recently and I definitely recommend it.  The staff was very friendly and attentive.  The steak I ordered was so tender that it practically melted when I touched it with my knife.  And it tasted even better.  I ordered shrimp with it as well and the each piece of shrimp was the size of my fist.  They, too, were delicious.  I received a small dessert with chocolate gellatto and real whipped cream which was awesome.  The one small misstep was actually the funniest part of the night.  My dad was having a gin and tonic and when he requested our main waiter for another one but with more gin in the drink, the second drink arrived in an even smaller glass.  My dad just sat and stared at the tiny little glass as I sat across the table chuckling for the rest of the evening.  So, it looks like you might not want to criticize the bartender.  Other than the sensitive bartender, the evening went off without a hitch.	2	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	1dV5ct9dz1gYeOOgXPLG-w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
CHG_7skJWQdnAf4ZWAP5uA	4	2009-06-24 00:00:00	Vegas is one of the few places in the U.S. where dining inside a hotel is cool and worth the extra green. Boy, did Emeril hit all the right notes on this little gem. It's both romantic and fun, warm and cool, and definitely a little trendy.\n\nI ordered the Quayle- off the chart delicious. The three other people I was with also loved their food. The wait staff does that stealthy stalking... you know... where one second you're staring into down into an empty H2O glass and then the next- it's completely full. Overall a great experience.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Tv_QGozKIK8NTfDFidBg7w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Great service too if you're a high roller, no so much for the average diner like me.\n\nThe table next to ours had someone on staff stopping by to check on the every few minutes, chat them up, pour more wine, etc.\n\nOur table of six received very mechanical service. Food was dropped off, and no one bothered to ask how the food was or of any of us would like another drink (two of us sat with an empty glass from the middle of the meal onward).\n\nFine dining is about the overall experience, and Delmonico let me down with poor service.\n\nThis was my second visit. I tried to give then a second chance, but this visit only confirmed the poor service from my first.  I will not be going back.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Yp0XAzUWc6Q8kQMoncxKCg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
chXHDHU3LDb3NEosHWw-YQ	5	2011-11-08 00:00:00	Five stars you ask? Yes I answer and don't ever doubt me again. \n\nFirst let me mention they have one of the best wine lists in Vegas due to the Delmonico in Miami closing down and sending 500+ wines to this one in Vegas. Sorry that your other restaurant closed, Emeril, but thanks for the amazing wine.\n\nFor appetizers we had a sampler plate that consisted of BBQ shrimp, cold crab legs, and truffle oil potato chips. All three were great but the truffle oil potato chips were freaking amazing! These were the first chips I have had in years and I am so glad I chose these to break my no chip policy. \n\nFor main I went with the filet mignon very rare and it was delicious with the perfect amount of dry rub and no sauce, just the way I like it. Their sides are served family style and I love that. We had the wild mushrooms, creamed corn, asparagus, and garlic mashed potatoes. \n\nOur dinner lasted three hours thanks to the amazing wine and they never once rushed us to leave. In fact, every time I came back to the table from the restroom (remember lots of wine) they had refolded my dinner napkin. Now that's some damn good service right there! \n\nThe ambiance is classy with all white walls, rounded ceilings and an open layout.

There only reason for 4 stars is the service was a bit too slow and inconsistent. I.E. our drink order was taken at 3 different times so we all received our drinks at different times.

cKMqmXYq7643CF8rao330w	5	2013-12-07 00:00:00	This is part of my steak house reviews for Las Vegas. Delmonico's is a premier steak place. The staff is top notch and make you feel at home even though it is a high end steak joint. We were there for a bachelor party.  all of us tried varieties of different cuts. The filet and ribeye were phenomenal. The side selection was not as good as some other steak places I've been too, however it was still good. The only drawback and it was a minor one, was we had a vegan with us. His chef's creation was substandard for a place this cutting edge.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	azcT4FIP0FCrCwbMQ51HpQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Didn't care for our meal, but the one thing that stood out was the Banana Cream Pie.\n\nWhen we were back in Vegas we stopped by just for a slice of that pie. A few years later and its as good as I remembered. I'm picky about bananas, not a pie person, and still this pie is amazing.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	IJfJlr0BIu-dH1ie__MbNg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
CmFUtCqEvMqm2beCTT_7Fw	4	2015-08-17 00:00:00	Prior to our trip, a few of us wanted to do a steak dinner in Vegas and we agreed on Delmonicos. Delving into the menu so I had an idea in mind of what I would be ordering, I became intrigued immensely when I saw that it was under Emeril's.\n\nWe were fortunate to be seated a little early. The ambiance of course evokes an intimate and formal setting with the dim lighting. The decor was minimal and I felt there could have used some art pieces.\n\nLet me say the service was top-notch. Although it is what you'd expect from such an establishment, very few places achieve such high marks IMO.\nThe water glasses were never empty and it felt like we didn't really have a server but a rotation of different people that comprised the waitstaff. I counted at least 6 different people between taking our order, serving the appetizers, the main course, side dishes, wine, filling the waters and dessert. \n\nAppetizer: Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare: Superb. I liked how the cucumber salad complemented the tuna & salmon and came in a spiraled form. The wonton chips were crispy and a nice form used for stacking the tartare & salad on. The wasabi provided a nice bite and offered a different note with the tartare. \n\nMain Course: Ribeye (no-bone). Some say the meat tastes better on the bone. In this case I found the Ribeye to be succulent, juicy well seasoned and cooked to perfection. Frankly I don't think it would have made much of difference if it was on the bone or not based on the flavor. Adding on the butter on top was a nice feature to the steak. \n\nSides: All the sides were delicious and was about the right amount to share for 3 (4 if the people aren't big eaters. \n\nPotato Gratin: So good I couldn't stop eating it. \n\nCreamed Spinach: No joke and the right balance of cream to tone down the strong taste of spinach was harmonic. \n\nAsparagus: I'm not an asparagus fan but if asparagus always tasted this good, it might crack my top 3 favorite vegetables. Had the right amount of salt and seasoning to create a more palatable asparagus. \n\nDessert: Sorbet; 3 scoops, 3 flavors. Strawberry, Banana and the 3rd resembled Coconut. I found the sorbet to be a more suitable and lighter offering vs. if it was an ice cream or gelato.\nClean flavors and the banana was surprisingly interesting given the fact its not something one often comes across.	4	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	611MiIXJkXM82I1y3Hg9eA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
CMO9gIfTd6VABmtyGNDUzQ	5	2012-03-06 00:00:00	On my usual quest for the best Ribeye in America I wandered into Delmonicos Steakhouse in the Venetian. This place was magnificent! It did have  bland all white decor in the main dining that reminded me of 2001 a Space Odyssey 's Discovery One with  really dim lights. Good thing the steaks were from another universe also! It had to have been the largest ribeye I have ever ordered for one person, and It came with a slab of butter!  Really it needs more butter? It was well marbled, thick with a little char (key !),  and it had a wonderful juicy flavor. It  was extremely good as I was so full about 3/4 of the way through, but as in "man vs food" i trudged on ! I have to say it was a fantastic to eat, but i did feel like a hundred pounds heavier throughout the evening! Try the steak.... try the bone in Ribeye steak.... did I mention you should try the steak?  then next time maybe have something else..... if you dare!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Dgx185t0xrXT8nboVCNBqA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I recommend getting the Rib Eye bone in if you can handle the incredible flavor of a Juicy aged steak. I like the steak so much I won't stop eating it until it's all gone. \n\nSave room for dessert or you'll miss out on something wonderful.	2	0	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	e2LtHijFAXy4RNTDL5IELw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
CqzA-kOMjBSd_1hCAdFBAA	5	2012-02-16 00:00:00	I wanted my 300 review to be special and this restaurant sure is special.\n\nI have been  fortunate to dine at Delmonico's Steakhouse over a half of dozen times. I have never been disappointed. \nLast weekend for the second time in my life was lucky enough to have the Chef's Table that over looks the kitchen. As with the last time I ate in the Chef's Table it rates as the top 5 meals I have ever had in my life.\nYou don't order at the chef's table you enjoy each course that chef personally prepares for you.  Each course is better then  the previous.\nSome of my favorite dishes in the dining room are:\nSteak Tartare-very tasty served with toasted baguette.\nEmeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp, an original menu item, that is so delicious.\nMy favorite steak is the Bone in Rib Eye, a great piece meat that is aged in house.\nThe service at Delmonico is second to none, what  they are noted for is that everybody at the table get there plate at the same time, a real nice touch.\nGreat side dishes,creamed corn and twice cooked potatoes are my favorite.\nService is always top notch.\nA can't miss\nI will be back soon.	1	1	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	soj3EaoFAhGqWgzGlfTTtg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
CSedaZsqWDBG8_tJ0NgTVw	5	2011-10-01 00:00:00	The only thing that would make dining at Delmonico's any better would be if Emeril Lagasse himself were sitting at your table.  On second thought, it might get awkward it he started yelling "BAM" every time I took a bite of food.\n\nDelmonico's has always been one of my favorite spots in Vegas.  I eat here anytime I'm in the city.  The service is always top notch and the food has consistently been delicious.  You really can't go too wrong with their menu.  The waitstaff assigned to your table are very helpful when you ask about the various dishes.\n\nI typically go with steak when I eat here.  They have always been cooked to perfection.  On my last visit, I had the grilled filet mignon medallions served with the mushroom crust, bacon and cheese.  I'm also a fan of the filet mignon served oscar style as well.  Both excellent.  Sides are great too.  Twice baked potato, mmmmmmmmm!	2	1	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	kS1-hIOkQlUvfmPL2WyvTA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
cTXbvM1CjxqS0c9HHaiEVA	4	2009-04-10 00:00:00	When I was looking for a place for dinner for my birthday celebration weekend, this place wasn't really high on my list. When it comes to purses, shoes and sometimes clothes, I'll put down a pretty penny or hundred for nice stuff. But when it comes to food, I think to myself, "Is it really worth the cost to put something in only to have it come out?" \n\nIn this case, "Yes!" Okay... Sort of... \n\nI ordered the boneless Ribeye and a side of broccoli. Ribeye was good - just enough flavor and not too salty. Being the carnivore that I am, I was shocked that I really enjoyed the broccoli too. It was as perfect as steamed vegetables could get. It was bright green from top to bottom and crispy, not mushy. \n\nMy sister had pasta with shrimp. I must say, though there was shrimp on her plate, they were not "shrimp" at all! They were huge!! Seriously, Delmonico must get their produce, seafood and meat from "Food Heaven R Us" or something. \n\nAlthough the food was good, I would say the service is what gives Delmonico 4-stars. Again, I'm not a frequent fine diner. So, to have my water glass filled up every time it gets low to having another (delicious) roll magically appear on my plate just as I suck in the last mouthful is fantastic! I'd even go so far as to say they'd probably spray the air around me with something fragrant once the broccoli hit you know where. \n\nNow I can see why it's worth it to pay at least $50 for dinner.

Sort of had a hint of wood burned flavor added to it. The bread that was served with it was like a Yorkshire pudding that had a slight wood burned taste...excellent. The coffee was less than average. The service was excellent.

The combination of the great food (meat and seafood) as well as the excellent wine selection (thanks Kevin) makes this a dining experience to die for.  You haven't experienced fine dining in Vegas until you've been here.\n\nI personally enjoy the jumbo lump crab cakes and bone in Rib Eye steak prepared the chef's way.  Round out your entree with any of these delicious sides Twice baked potatoes with bacon, asparagus, creamed corn, and creamed spinach.\n\nI'm an adventurous eater and am always open to trying new wine pairings so I just ask for Kevin Vogt (Master Sommelier) for recommendations based on our food order.  You will never be disappointed.  Kevin is a wealth of knowledge and will introduce you to wines that you may not have heard of or tried before.  The great thing is that these wine selections are of great value. \n\nFor large parties, definitely call ahead and secure a reservation.  Parties of 4 or less should have no problems getting a table with a minimal wait.  If you're impatient or hungry, you should book a reservation just in case there's a convention in town.  This place gets busy!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	GEedb5rb_Fww6YJc6CRSsg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We got there in plenty of time and explained that we wanted to sit and enjoy our experience and planned on being there for awhile.  We were told that it was no problem and they were happy to have us as long as we like.  We were never once rushed or pushed out like at a lot of places just trying to turn tables even though we were there 2-3 hours.  The service was amazing but not to the point where you were harrassed...our drinks were never empty and plates never sat long but it seems we never noticed the waiter coming and going which is awesome.  We took our time with drinks, appetizers, and dinner and all were timed perfectly and served when we were ready.  The food was amazing as well!  I had the escargot and the bone-in ribeye which was the best steak I have ever had!  I have had a lot of steaks from so called steakhouses and top recommended restaurants, this is definitely tops!  My wife had the lobster bisque and king crab legs which were also absolutely delicious.  The prices are higher, but it goes directly with the service and quality of food and I have no problem paying for what we got.

It had (and I quote from the menu) Fresh White Italian Truffles, Parmesan Reggiano, Vermont Butter and Local Chives. I can't wait to come back just to get this, but it was a special, so hopefully they will have it!\n\nThe staff was great too. Very helpful and not stuffy at all.

cYJjGasWb-lGBGQ8mOFCvQ	5	2009-02-24 00:00:00	Located on Restaurant Row in the Venetian is Delmonico's Steakhouse. This place is nice, very nice. The lounge area was spacious, plentiful amount of seating, with a bar area. Not a bad place to hang out if there is a wait for your table. You are not able to see inside the restaurant from the lounge area. \n\nWe had a table of 13 and we were separated into 2 tables. The seats were very very comfortable. I believe they do accommodate large parties all in one table, but I guess for that time slot on that day, this was our only choice. Reservations are highly recommended here and book in advance if you have a large party. \n\nOur waiter or host shall I call him was very informative about just about everything! He recommended what was the best things on the menu, where to party after dinner, what wines were great, along with how I should get my steak cooked! He was simply awesome. \n\nI order the BONE IN RIB STEAK which is also originally what the server recommended. The price for a good steak does not come cheap, this one was worth all $52.00. Medium rare was perfect. The steak is huge it almost took up the whole entire plate, tender, moist, juicy, perfect temperature, minimal fat, butter came on top of the steak like a pancake, very easy to cut, bone was just this big straight across:\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nso it was very easy to get every last piece off the bone. \n\nI strongly suggest you order the steak with a nice red wine. Your taste buds will be in heaven. \n\nThe sides are a bit deceiving if you look at the pictures of the sides. For some reason I was expecting a huge pot, but dont let the pictures fool you! The side order of sauteed mushrooms was very delicious. I put that to the side because I did not want to share with anyone. The truffle potato chips was very greasy, save your $10 and order another side instead. \n\nThe calamari was okay. Not worth the $14. Marinara sauce came on top of the calamari already, so if you did not eat it fast enough, it could get soggy real quickly. \n\nTHEY HAVE THE BEST WARM BREAD HERE EVER! TEST YOURSELF AND SEE IF YOU CAN RESIST JUST ONE! \n\nI can finally say I ate at one of Emeril's restaurants! Seeing you on the Food Network making all those different mouth watering dishes is for real! Definitely a must try if you are a steak lover.	8	8	8	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	K0mFbYeHkpA6MME2lllwgw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Top notch steakhouse.\n\nThe bone in ribeye was delicious, as you would expect there was a lot of fat on it but the flavor was worth it.  \n\nThe bone in filet (a special) was very good, tender, less fat than the rib eye but also less flavor.  \n\nI would say both are worth getting but it depends on your preference for flavor vs. tenderness.  \n\nThe duck was very good - not fatty as most duck is but still full of flavor - if you are looking for a non steak entre I think this is the way to go.\n\nI didn't have one so I cannot confirm but someone I was dining with said the mojito was the best they have ever had so keep that in mind if you are a mojito fan.\n\nOverall a great dinner.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	tx_PcXtzSBA0DFngdcQG3Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
D-qWg5Gi5DDMQbEAYI4lJw	5	2016-02-14 00:00:00	AWESOME!!! Best steak I have EVER had. This is not a chain restaurant, the prices are significant, but the food and service are well worth it in my opinion. I love steak and have tried a variety of great steakhouses in amazing cities, but none can compare to Delmonico's. My wife is generally not impressed by food, she sees it more of necessity that something to be enjoyed, but she continues to rave about Delmonico's. Whenever I'm in Vegas, I will definitely dine at Delmonico's.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	HXCkmsRmW1jRs8xlEWd-7A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The fries are not in the menu but are AMAZING. All in all one of my favorite steak houses in Vegas. A must try.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	t58-mCKixnzxZaAaowGUWA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
d3-sC4eUvIdDzz6KgvCMXg	4	2006-07-15 00:00:00	Don't get me wrong by the lack of a fifth star, I really, really loved dining at Delmonico's.  I thought the service was extremely attentive (truly some of the best service I have had) and food was great.  I would definitely return and I am sure we would have another wonderful dining experience.  However, I have had better steaks so I cannot rank this as the best of the best.  On the other hand, this is one of the best restaurants I have been to in Vegas and would definitely give it two thumbs up and recommend it to those staying at the Venetian.	2	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	R0KVWeN9xR-F6j4z5k9wXQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
D34vgnye7MXD0zdlS7fWJw	2	2009-02-01 00:00:00	I'll make this one an easy read. \n\nI have been to this steakhouse 4 times since it has opened. The 1st time being within it's 1st month, the last several weeks ago.\n\nMy 1st 2 visits were awesome, great steaks and sides and good service, then something happened on my 3rd trip about 1 1/2 years ago, the food was just o.k. not horrible but nothing that great. Well a few weeks ago we were back at the Venetian.  I was there with my Wife, 2 sons(16 and 5) and my Sister in Law, everyone wanted steak, so we decided why not let's try Delmonico's.\n\nTurns out this was a bad choice and one that will keep me from going back, with all the new crops of good steakhouses(many within the same hallway) that have popped up since this place has opened, Delmonico's needs to get it's act together.\n\nWe ordered 3 Rib Eyes, 1 Filet, and my 5 year old got a burger. For sides truffled potato chips, mashed potatoes and corn.\n\nWhen we were sat, we immediately were served water and our drink orders taken, that was the highlight of the meal. It took about 20 minutes to get our drinks and orders taken. When we asked if they had anything specific for our 5 year old, they suggested the burger, fine he can have that, if not my Wife would have just split some of her filet with him\n\nWhen our food came about 50 minutes later, mind you the place had just opened and there were no more than 4 other tables occupied. They put all our food down in front of us and they then proceeded to give my son a burger that had to have been at least 12 ounces, we all looked at each other and then commented on how and why would they serve him that.  Mind you, waiter suggested this burger for the 5 yr old.\n\nBack to the other plates, it was just large chunks of flavorless meat, the sides were bland and the truffled chips were soaking in oil. When it was all over and done we had been there almost 2 hours and were out almost $300. I have no problem spending good money for a good meal, but this meal left us feeling like we had wasted our time and our money.\n\nWill not go back.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	u4phtmfxRcfHR0dgoWvdRA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
D4R4YkIR5yS8swRONQIBkA	3	2013-07-10 00:00:00	Had dinner on 6/26/13. This was the second time my wife and I dined at Delmonico Steakhouse. The 1st time I ordered the bone-in-ribeye and was disappointed because it had some gristle and was underwhelming to say the least. On this trip, the wife had the organic baby mixed greens salad and the Filet while I had the shrimp cocktail and once again the bone-in-ribeye. We also shared an order of asparagus.\n\nThe Filet was good - tender and nicely seasoned. My ribeye was disappointing, however. It was not very tender and didn't have much flavor for being dry-aged 2-3 weeks as per our waiter.\n\nThe service and atmosphere are on par with most of the other high-end steakhouses in Vegas, but the steaks are not as good as those we have had at Craftsteak, Cut, N9ne, Stripsteak, Prime, or even STK. Does not deserve more than 3 stars IMO and even though it wasn't bad, it is not good enough for us to return especially with all the other choices in town.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	6v_jnMTkbe04XzRPrJWHCw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Da8W7s9vZk9N5oGXSNdMgw	5	2009-02-26 00:00:00	For a steak place in Vegas .. 5 stars, and this is simply why.\n\n\nSteak, $52 Bone in ribeye, one of the best 20 oz steaks I've ever had\nService, waiters were always very helpful\nDrinks and apps, good flavor and well and fair portions.\n\nAll in all, i expected to be hungry after and go to like a smaller and quicker place after just to make sure i was full, but i was so satisfied i was sleepy.   Also, i went in at 8:30 for my meal and for a table of 4 i think we left like close to 11. It wasn't that the service was slow, the atmosphere and ambiance was just right to forget time and enjoy your meal and the people your with.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	BJmQnjZi4tYlkMZWubEXAA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
dasxQe5zVeI-mX09OWMyTQ	4	2007-06-21 00:00:00	I have been to many steak places in Vegas and had always wanted to go, but it can be hard to get a reservation. This time we planned way in advance so we could eat at a reasonable time. \n\nThe food: The food was reasonable but slightly over priced. The steak that I had was good and cooked to how I ordered it, but for $52.00, it could have been better. Since it was served a la carte, I ordered a baked potato, $8.00.  I would suggest the pecan pie for dessert, best I have ever had.\n\nThe service: Some of the best service I have every see before. Everything was excellent from the moment our server arrived at our table to the moment we left. Very professional but not to stuffy. All of his suggestions were right on.\n\nI am not sure I would go again, since there are so many places to choose from, but I would suggest it to my friends.	1	0	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ubP_P_-OKS1P6RsqNKnhdw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The food is great but I expect something more spectacular at Emeril's restaurant.  Maybe I need to try a steak here next time.  It is a great lunch stop when you are looking for a place with no wait.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	BV5YOcYbKhotdBJDb8AJ7A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
dCGICz131j5eZqQAcgoCjA	5	2010-12-09 00:00:00	I chose this place for my birthday and it ended up to be the perfect choice. \nService and ambiance were marvelous and I was really happy! \n\nThis is what we ordered: \nJumbo Lump Crab Cake: all crab meat with hardly any filler. AMAZING \n\nLobster Bisque: Not a bisque person but it was so delicious here. yummy!!! \n\nWhite cheddar & bacon grits: creamy and cheesy, oh so good! \n\nWild sauteed mushrooms: Perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Pair with steak very well.\n\nBone in rib eye: Nice big piece of steak with a bit of fat, which is the way I like my steak. \n\nChateaubriand: 2 big pieces of fillet Mignon that also comes with a side of steamed asparagus and mashed potatoes finished at table side for two people. Fillet was SO tender and juicy, probably one of the best I've had! Not an asparagus person so it was bleh. Mashed potatoes were ok. \n\nI would love to go back again with my boyfriend and have a romantic dinner.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	-mXobpJ3z3X6nMriCklbog	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
DcXdtQKVEk3GwRTmr9ODHw	4	2016-09-28 00:00:00	I ordered the filet mignon, not the best I had. Cooked right but not as tender. The sides were much better. We had the creamed corn and potatoes au gratin, my favorite. We ordered some kind of butter cake for dessert. No one at our table liked it. One of the servers overheard us talking about the cake and the waiter immediately came and took it off the tab. They do have great service and the decor is nice but with so many great restaurants in the city, I don't need to go back.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	wFUAuusR5n2E6T-C0IvYug	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We even got two tables of 10 next to each other! Excellent service! The food was good but did not stand out from most of the other vegas steakhouses or normal steakhouses in general. I would recommend just based on service we received.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	VIBLmq5wm3NGbhiqyBJpUw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
DDw7uLKW4yAYnn5rZiNMgw	5	2013-05-16 00:00:00	Decadent.  Delicious.  Delightful.  \n\nThat was our experience, celebrating our 3-year Wedding Anniversary at Delmonico's! \n\n#Bone-In Ribeye ~ a must ($52).  Tender, seasoned and delicious.  Perfectly cooked medium rare.  We added the foie gras accompaniment ($20), which made it INCREDIBLE.  Killer combo and highly recommended!\n\n#Corn Au Gratin ~ piping hot, with crunchy bread crumbs on top.  Not too heavy, not too light.  A definite winner.  I could not stop eating it.\n\n#Creamed Spinach ~ good.  Also not too heavy.  But, not mind blowing.  \n\n#Wild Mushroom Pappardelle Pasta with Truffle ~ a decadent appetizer and quite delicious.  ($20)  This was a dinner special, so I don't know if they regularly have it.  Tasty, but quite a small proportion.\n\n#Lobster Salad with Champagne Vinaigrette ~ tasty, with a nice chunk of lobster on the side of leafy greens, thinly sliced red onions and halved cherry tomatoes.  ($20) But, nothing to write home about.  \n\n#Bread ~ Biscuit shaped croissants, with butter.  Ok.  Would have been better served warm.  \n\nService was attentive.  Our champagne glasses were topped off regularly.  Water glasses refilled constantly.  Reservations were a piece of cake through OpenTable.  Seated within 5 minutes of arrival.  Total bill - $200+ for 2 people.  Reasonably priced for fine dining.  \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  Highly recommend and would dine again!  Next time, I will leave room for dessert.  Creme Brulee and Bread Pudding was on the menu and I heart both!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	qoffZ865qwpYJ9ZTcEUlTg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The only way the bread can be cold on  a very busy night was the left over from other tables. \nThe food was good except the Thanksgiving turkey meal was bad! Tasteless, not good at all!!\nThe whole time the server barely came over to check on us and we had to flag him down after so many times of him passing but not looking at us. \nWill not recommend and never go back.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	x0LC7cC7rpFCOV0LumvQgA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Great environment, amazing food, superb service and to go with excellent collection of wine.

DHO975G0ZTCI9pPCSVmjRw	5	2013-07-04 00:00:00	Let's be honest: steakhouses are a dime-a-dozen in Las Vegas. Every which way you look, there's some place that's being advertised as "The Best Steakhouse in Nevada!" or "THE Las Vegas Steakhouse" or "If Elvis Were Alive, He Would Eat Here!"\n\nNot all steakhouses are created equal -- Delmonico is proof of that.\n\nSituated in between the Palazzo and the Venetian, Delmonico is unassuming from the outside. It looks simple and classy. Once you step inside, however, you realize that comfort is their highest priority. The chairs are deep and made of the most comfortable leather. You won't want to get up when you're finished with your meal. \n\nThis was our second visit (our first for lunch), and I must say that the service was just as attentive and cordial as they had been the first time. Both of our servers were named Peter (which turned out to be quite humorous when we called out for one and they both came running), and they were extremely pleasant. They had absolutely no problem recommending dishes or letting us know their personal favorites. \n\nFor my appetizer, I had the heirloom tomato salad. The tomatoes were ripe, juicy, and delicious. The accompanying cheese was a perfect pair to offset the acidity of the tomatoes. Thin slivers of onions covered the perimeter of the plate, which were also very nice.\n\nI chose the fillet of beef medallions for my entree, and I was impressed with how absolutely wonderful they were. About a half-dollar in diameter and an inch tall, they were perfectly cooked, not to mention topped in Parmesan cheese and drizzled with homemade Worcestershire sauce. \n\nDelmonico doesn't need to be one of those places that wears people out with advertising. They know how good they are, and they aren't afraid to knock your socks off. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a relaxing way to enjoy an evening with good people and great food.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	cN_-_OE_cwYKcmHfpOHejw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
dIcxp2EISkirAkhdNP5e1A	5	2010-03-10 00:00:00	Yummy!  I didn't realize this was an Emeril (the "BAM!!!" guy on the Food Network) restaurant until I looked at the menu.  Cherylynn N. made reservations for a friend's 30th birthday dinner celebration.  Our reservations were at 7pm, but part of our party got lost so we were seated around 7:15-7:30pm.  \n\nAMBIANCE:\nWell lit, but dim which created a "romantic" setting for those looking for a date night.  As we had 9 people in our party, we were set up in the middle in umm...an oddly shaped table (see Cherylynn N's description).  The restaurant was packed, but the noise level wasn't too loud.\n\nSERVICE:\nGREAT service!  The waitress was very attentive.  When the food was brought out, there were 5 servers which each carried our entrees in each hand and simultaneously placed them in front of each of us at once.  It was truly a sight to see.\n\nFOOD:\n**Note: Most dishes are ala carte, so you'll probably want to order sides.  Sides are big enough for 2-3 people to share**\n\n-Crab Bisque ($12) - Delicious, creamy, and full of yummy flavor!!  This was on the Chef's special list, therefore I am not sure if they have this on a regular basis.  The bisque soup is the same as the lobster bisque, but instead of lobster pieces, its generous portions of crab.\n\n-Jumbo Lobster Tail ($48/Market Price) - As I am not such a big meat eater, a lobster tail was my alternative.  I didn't expect such a generous sized portion to come out.  It was heaven!!  Delicious!!  Tender!! \n\n-Creamed Spinach Side ($9) - It was good, but didn't have the additional pieces of bacon that most restaurants have.  You could definitely tell the spinach was fresh though.  \n\n-Creamed Corn Side ($9) - YUMMMMMMM!!  I must come back especially for this side!! The corn was so sweet with a light crust on top.  Words cannot describe how yummy this side was, definitely a must try!!\n\nSo I know this is a steakhouse with steak, of course, being their specialty.  My friend insisted that I try some of his rib eye.  I'm not a meat person, but I will admit that it was tender and full of flavor.	2	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	YOChRzTztTL_KooP9wEtSQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The bone in ribeye (Delmonico), cream corn, cream spinach, potatoes gratin, even the mixed greens salad were fantastic! The banana cream pie and even the quality of coffee were above par. Our waiter Michael and his co-staff were great. We have a now a total of three great experiences at Delmonico. Is it expensive, well isn't everything in Vegas?

I felt like I was sitting in a ball room rather than a restaurant and although we ordered a bottle of white wine and a bottle of red wine, both bottles were opened in front of us without offering us to taste before pouring the glasses.

dm1Ug_flkAhFuBrh2EGUFw	5	2010-01-18 00:00:00	This is my favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas, bar none. You can always count on Emeril Lagasse to deliver on his good name. We were in town for my fiance's birthday, so I jumped at the chance to make a reservation at Delmonico. \n\nWe arrived about 20 mins early for our reservation. We took a seat in the lounge and waited for about 3 minutes before they came and got us to be seated. Not enough time to rate the cocktail service. \n\nI started with the lobster bisque. Creamy, hot, and with chunks of tender lobster aplenty. So flavorful, I chose to pass on the offer of fresh ground pepper. An A+ app. \n\nOn to main course. I had the boneless rib eye steak. I LOVED that the waiter asked me to cut into it in front of him to be sure it was prepared to my liking, and it was perfect! Upon the first bite, time stood still. I could think of nothing but how delicious the bite in my mouth was, and how I could not wait to demolish the easily 12oz. piece of heaven in front of me. The meat had a juiciness and flavor that even the most discerning of carnivore would have to admit was the best ever. \n\nThe fiancee had the Grilled Filet Medallions, wild mushroom crusted with Emeril's Worcestershire sauce, house cured bacon, and Parmesan cheese. I, of course, had to have a taste of these fantastic looking medallions, and they were stellar. I especially liked the play between the slightly sweet of the Worcestershire and the savory of the meat and Parmesan crust. Also an awesome dish. \n\nDue to the healthy portions, there was no room for dessert. We were given a sorbet on the house that was very tangy, a raspberry I believe... \n\nThe service was top notch, everything you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. All my expectations were met, and I highly recommend stopping in for the steak of a lifetime!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	tLp-SQmouWHCjdftlm_cyw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

My colleague talked me into going here and it was overpriced and not great.\n\nI think your typical chain high-quality steakhouse is better than this place and actually cheaper.  Not that the price matters that much - you just notice when it is premium pricing and sub-par food.\n\nI had the bone-in ribeye and it was enormous but wasn't really special.\n\nWould not bother going again - I will rather try somewhere else.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	XIqXF3094vyQik2U_-zJEg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
dOY4XofIPnzm98S9EN5Tog	3	2014-08-02 00:00:00	Food was excellent!!!!  The favorites of our group were lobster, ribeye, filet, rack of lamb.  Salmon was a bit dry and halibut was just ok, but fine.  My personal standout for the many sides we got was the potatoes au gratin...I'm still dreaming!!!  Our service was just ok until the end when our server scolded someone in our group and said "sssshhhhh."   Really???  If he was ruining something for other customers (which I'm sure he wasn't--others tables were toasting with us) than a manager should've come up and said something, not her.  I mentioned to the hostess we were a lively group and to sit us accordingly.  She assured me it was not a problem.  We spent a lot of money and ended on a sour note--which is no bueno....it could've been handled so much better.  Also, they knew we were celebrating an anniversary and didn't bring a complimentary dessert??? (I think even Cheesecake Factory does that?).  It just seemed the waitress had a personality problem and didn't like us from the get go. Unfortunately, this is the second visit here where the service has fallen short.  Four stars for food.  Not in a hurry to go back.  There's no "sssshhhhh-ing in Vegas!"	4	3	5	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Db80SCez0BdYaHdC0xmzoQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
DP1CYxeDDlaLu1gMYSA9cQ	3	2009-09-22 00:00:00	About 2 years ago, I had dreamed of eating steak at Delmonico's.  The reputation of this place exceeds my expectations; and, as such, is my dilemma with this place.  Delmonico's is Emeril lagasse's steak house.  It is his prime choice, so-to-speak, and it has one of the prime locations between the Palazzo and the Venetian, right in front of the Blue Man Group entrance, across from V-bar, B&B, and next door to Aquaknox.  I've walked by this place numerous times and always wanted to eat there.  Suffice to say, in the past two years, I have.  In short, I have eaten at Delmonico's 6 times.  Not bad for someone that gives this place 3-stars.  \n\nPros: \nWine list is expansive and can be very intimidating.  However, I question the knowledge of one of the staff when they recommended a pinot for our bone-in ribeye.  I know a little bit about wine, well, who I am I kidding, I pretend to know a lot.  Enough to the point that I didn't think I'd want a pinot.  However, it was his recommendation and I thought I would go with it.  It was definitely a pinot.  Very disappointed since the body of it didn't fit right with our bone-in ribeye (which was my concern to begin with).\nThe steak is choice (to steal my favorite John Hughes film).\nCan sit large groups fairly easily.\nWill sit a table fairly late (almost 11pm on a Friday night).\nExcellent sides.\nThey are fairly attentive with the service.\nThe scotch list is reasonable.  However, I do usually get a vodka martini with blue cheese stuffed olives (and they hit it pretty good).  \nThey do have a chef's table near the kitchen.  For a heavy trafficked weekend, I believe you have to book well into 3-months in advance (numbers change based on availability).  I am interested in trying this because I think it would be a blast to have a bunch of friends, drinking out of a magnum, and eating some good steak (but I'm not that organized nor do I have an event to do that with).  Well, who am I kidding, I don't even have that many friends.  Ha!  Anyways...\n\n\nCons: \nI always get the bone-in ribeye and each time I've eaten it, the seasoning (which I believe is a cajun based creole seasoning) is slightly different each time.  In some cases the seasoning can be too much and in others, its not enough.  There just isn't any consistency.\nAll but one time I've eaten here someone has gotten the ribeye too rare or too well-done.  The fact that they can't get this right concerns me.  You are a steakhouse; get it right; its what you are supposed to be good at!\nThe decor is more monastery like.  \n\nThe first time I ate here, I gave it 4-stars (my meal was great, my girlfriends meal wasn't cooked right).  If they clean up their act and make things tight and organized, I think Delmonico's is a 4-star steakhouse.  The steak is pretty tasty.  Its perfectly okay to pick up the bone and start gnawin on it.  Well, within reason of course.  However, it has too much inconsistency between day to day operations and meals.  To be fair, I'd still come and eat here (cause I believe the steak is an excellent quality of meat) but with the competition being so tight in Vegas, I've started to venture out.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	lBrqz3tvS2SU7al1sagZBw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
DQ4bI0zM-CFR6rpiwOB01A	4	2014-02-17 00:00:00	Took my fiancé here for our 5 year anniversary since he is such a fan of steak.  To be honest, I always felt that if you've been to one steakhouse, you've been to them all.  But that doesn't mean the food was any less delicious.  \n\nThe truffle chips were crunchy and packed with flavor and the salmon tartare was delicious!  We also ordered the bone in filet, which was a little on the salty side but the meat was perfectly tender...but what I was extremely excited about was the foie gras (banned in California).  The order of foie gras was plentiful and just heaven paired with the steak.  \n\nThe service was impeccable, I never once felt forgotten.\n\nSigh, I guess I'll need to take that 4 hour drive everytime I'm craving foie gras.....	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	CACiMCu6j4PLycQ98XRDVA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Dqnuu3U5c45vW6axTMqWdA	4	2015-11-11 00:00:00	We originally booked reservations at another restaurant. Then we decided to go to the Diana Ross show so decided to go to Delmonico so we wouldn't have to rush after the show. What a great choice. We had the fries oysters and I could've had three orders. They were perfectly prepared and so savory! We were served several piping hot pop over rolls with rosemary baked into them. They literally melt in your mouth. It was late and we weren't super hungry so we decided to try several small plates.  We split the salmon. The salmon was perfect. A bit spicy, a bit sweet with potato hash and andoulle sausage. We also had the creamed spinach, BBQ shrimp and the grits. I didn't love the grits but everything else was awesome. They have a full selection of bourbons (an entire book) which made my bf very happy. I had a really crisp Rose' .. it was really good. The staff works as a team to make sure no needs go unmet. Nicole was so engaging and accommodating. We will go back next time we are in town.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	mT5BT_BcE-3x_zWo_Fqmvg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

dr1srBK5SHaY5QcwSTWM5A	5	2015-09-22 00:00:00	I celebrated Christmas here with my family in 2014. My grandfather had cancer and wanted an authentic caesar salad since his appetite was back and he felt better. The service was  outstanding and so was the food. My sister and I had to split a T-bone steak because it was so big. We devoured it in about 3 minutes because it just melted. It was seasoned perfectly and the side orders we picked came in generous portions (we had to take them home).  My grandfather loved the salad he kept saying it was exactly what he was craving. It was the first time I'd eaten a correctly made caesar and it was extremely well flavored. Everyone was so stuffed and we had tons of food left over. As I stated before the service was outstanding I day this because my grandfather started feeling pain and needed to be taken home to have his medication immediately. They let half of us leave to escort him to our ride and we hadn't even paid or bill. They discreetly packed up or food and took our payment after they were sure his situation was handled, they even offered to have security bring a wheel chair and escort us out the Venetian. That was the last Christmas meal I will ever share with him because he recently passed away but thanks to the understanding, kindness, and professionalism of the staff I will forever have a beautiful memory.	2	0	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	HsyZMS4VcMQ16RM3_IMB6g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

DRSC9PlN1SesZh7J3ANdFA	4	2011-10-23 00:00:00	Another great steakhouse in Las Vegas (I think almost all of them are great, and it all depends on what style you are looking for). This is a chain restaurant so some might be skeptical, but overall I think this is one of the better restaurants of the chain (as I have been to several of the Delmonico restaurants). The service was great as usual and for the price point of the steak, I think one of the more affordable steakhouses in Las Vegas for what you get. \n\nThe bone-in rib eye - cooked to perfect medium rare and the one thing that Delmonico's adds to their steaks is a big chunk of herb butter that just adds so much more flavor to the steak (although you know its bad for you, you just want more!). \n\nSides - great for sharing and we had the mixed mushrooms, creamed spinach and creamed corn. Not the best sides that I've had, but they were good.\n\nOverall, a great option for a steakhouse in The Venetian and in Las Vegas.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	6QFyYvYgN1XcVfxMMMWxGw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

dT7igWKgSEpm_l23lt0mng	2	2016-10-22 00:00:00	My wife and I were very excited to visit the restaurant, however, although the service was superb, the overall taste and quality of the meal was lacking and something to be desired. The "feel" and atmosphere of the restaurant was dull and drab, with chairs lining the walls towards the restaurant which seems to be very far away from the main dining area, loud noises from kids with no supervision and an atmosphere that  just wasn't romantic and inviting. If I had to do it again I would go somewhere else,  as there are many other restaurants on The Strip where you can spend in excess of  $150 and get more value. The most impressive part of the meal was the attentive wait staff, they were extremely professional, courteous and attended to our every need.\n\nThe other Emeril's restaurant at the MGM Grand was superb, I'm not sure what is going on with Delmonico. Hopefully mgmt. will do more to make the experience more enjoyable. Hope this review helps.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	nGw_csaHeNdtb3IpSmtuGA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

My steak was cooked perfectly and the sides we ordered (musrooms, mashed potatoes, and shoot I can'r remember is they were green beans or asparagus) were all tasty. \n\nIf you want a good old fancy steak dinner that's reasonably priced this place is not a bad place to go for it. \n\nOh! the service was fantastic.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	UMYdQuub9yqqZWOmFlmhdQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Dw5Q3jRq16G5Kc5KuS37tw	3	2015-04-28 00:00:00	I had been to Delmonico when they first opened years ago and was so impressed. This time, I was definitely underwhelmed. First,we had a 5:00 reservation and there right when they opened. We had stated on our reservations that it was was our anniversary. We got no acknowledgement of it and were seated at the worst table in the restaurant in a corner with a cheap floor lamp that was covered in dust next to us. No one was even in the restaurant, so they could have given us a nice booth. It was still dead there at 6:30 when we left. On to the food. Popovers were just ok. Hubby's ribeye was yummy. My filet however, was dry as the Sahara and had no flavor. Not a speck of juice ran out when I cut into it. My hubby said it looked like jerky. So disappointed. Sides creamed spinach and twice baked potato were just ok. Twice baked was just a big greasy glob of cheese and wasn't even hot. For dessert, we got the banana cream pie. It was good but I was expecting it to wow me based on what others had said about it. Sadly, I don't think I'll be back. For the price, I'd rather have Mastros or Ruth's Chris.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	kmzLTYyDX1FnGvDAfvsJJA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

DxY6v0D9knyQPWlVkK7FJw	4	2009-03-05 00:00:00	This is not my first time at Delmonico. I was in Vegas a few years ago on business (again) and had a group dinner (10-12 people) here. I did not make the reservation but the person who did somehow got us the chef's table. If you are not familar...the chef's table is it's own room separate but right next to the kitchen. Because the room is made up of clear glass...we could see right into the kitchen and watch our meals being made. It was very cool. We did the tasting menu. It was all great and the portions were so large that by round 4 I was uncomfortably full...and still had the steak course to go! \n\nI came back for dinner last week with some friends for dinner. No chef's table this time...sat in the regular ole dining area. Service was pretty good and I thought the food delivered (although my initial experience was a bit more memorable). We had the calamari with an live tapenade and also the BBQ shrimp. I thought the calamari was good, not spectacular (this would not have been my first choice as an app but I wasn't the only one at dinner). I thought the BBQ shrimp was delicious and had great flavor, cooked perfectly. Split a blue cheese wedge - can't go wrong there. I had the mixed grill special which came with a piece of pork tenderloin, slab of bacon & a piece of andouille sausage all served over greens and andouille grits. Delicous! The andouille sausage was the star of the plate as far as I'm concerned. My friend had a ribeye and a cheddar twice baked potato and enjoyed it. Someone else got the pork tenderloin off the regular menu which came with grits, greens & cornbread pancakes (which were tasty). All of us enjoyed our meals. I think it's a nice little "splurge" for dinner. \n\nI do agree with another reviewer who said that the ambience is nothign special (unless you get the chef's table of course) and that the steak selection was nothing different - same cuts of meat as other fine steak houses. I didn't see that "wow" factor onthe menu...which is why I ordered one of the specials.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	eWwCTKEcz87qHFNsVGqsnA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Dy1us2L-Icozq1JawV_U2g	5	2009-04-07 00:00:00	Lets start with the fact that I pretty much have given up on fancy corporate owned pretentious restaurants years ago.  I prefer the owner operated versions where you can get top notch ingredients cooked expertly with love and care.  Isn't that what we really want when we dine out? In my case, yep. \n\nI have been to several of Emerils restaurants in NOLA as well as the one in the MGM, and this was one fine, and to my surprise, a very fun expierence as well. From the time we walked in we had a hilarious encounter with the hostess.  She informed us that it was an hour wait for the dining room.  We didnt want to wait that long so she offered us the option of sitting at the bar.  \n\nHmm, glanced over and observed a 60ish man and a bouffant haired woman sitting towards the end of the bar, a couple of empty seats to their left, but that was busy with a crowd of men milling about. I jokingly said to the hostess that was not a bad option, but that lady looked like the type that would be doused in perfume which would be a bit of a palate buzz kill. She stated that she was sensitive to that as she was allergic to perfume. I, again joking, suggested she stroll by and test the air. \n\nShe immediately walked towards the lady doing a perfect "whistle past the graveyard" stroll and raised her nose to the heavens as she passed the suspect. It was absolutely hilarous. Guess we couldnt leave after that, damn glad we stayed. \n\nThe other reviewers have already testified re; the awesome food, I definetly concur, but wanted to yelp about the personality of some of the staff. Oh, our bartendress/server was a joy as well.	2	1	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	qSPFhtM-eO842BVQXtAMNg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
D_n4AiXHKrbCr81Y0g2_IA	5	2010-04-03 00:00:00	Hey everyone - first yelp review. And what better way to kick it off than with the wonderful Delmonico Steakhouse in the Venetian Hotel and Casino. This is my first Emeril's experience and it was a good one. \n\nDisclaimer: A fraternity brother of mine is a manager here and insisted that my group try it! \n\nI was in town for a bachelor party and 8 of us dined here on a Friday night. We had a reservation for 8:30 and were seated promptly. The appetizers included delicious (albeit greasy) chips sprinkled with parmesan cheese and the New Orleans BBQ Shrimp with biscuit. The shrimp were easily the most tasty that I've ever had - my only complaint is that one order ($18 only included 3 shrimp). I wish I had 2 or even three. The biscuit was pointless for this entree (and barely noticeable), It actually went uneaten as our party was preoccupied with the wonderful hot butter rolls that they continued to bring around.\n\nFor my entree I had the filet mignon ($48) and it was absolutely fabulous. I order my steaks medium well to well, which could sometimes mean a loss of flavor if it's not done right. In this case, the steak was cooked perfectly and had a ton of flavor. This was easily the best steak I've ever had - and I'm a red meat fan. \n\nService was excellent, atmosphere was a bit gloomy (although aren't good steak houses supposed to be?) and I was simply too full to try dessert. The rest of the party thoroughly enjoyed their meal. The highlight of the evening may have been seeing Larry Flynt seated just a few feet away from us, enjoying his steak and eggs. Apparently he's a regular.\n\nIf you're in Vegas and looking for a sure-fire steakhouse, stop by Emeril's Delmonico. You WON'T be disappointed.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	0S3NwXpfDkEQ9QcK018jcg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
e-rkMqQ3CRIXRfI_9kQTAQ	4	2013-01-16 00:00:00	I stumbled into Delmonico Steakhouse after going to the wrong place as suggested by my friend. He told me to go to Emeril's in Vegas, so I did. However, the only place that houses Emeril's name is the Fish House.\n\nMy friend challenged me that Demonico had the best Caesar salad after I claimed I had found the holy grail. So I had to try it here. First off, they make it from scratch, tableside here. They even have you inspect it before putting salad in.\n\nPreviously I thought I had good Caesar salad, but this was on a different level. The salads that I've had before were either good or bad. The flavor was just that. however this salad actually had *waves* of flavor. you could distinctly taste the pepper fade in and out, the egg fade in and out, sardines fade in and out, and other flavors until it mellowed out on your palette. WTF, are you serious? I didn't even know salad dressing could do that. I give the salad a 5/5\n\nMy lady and I shared the lamb. I am not a huge lamb eater because I generally find it too fatty and I don't like fatty texture. This was good though and I did enjoy it all. It could have been a little more charred on the outside as I found that part to be the most tasty. I probably would have been better off with something a little more traditional like steak, I suppose. I'll give them lamb a 4/5\n\nFor dessert I got this cheesecake that was akin to a smore. It was seriously yum. I was stuffed before I started it, and I still ate it - it was that good. I will give it a 5/5.\n\nWhat was magnificent with this place was the service. I am very particular with service and how often the service visits your table. I was a little scared at first of this place when they announced that we would be attended by three different people. Of crap I thought, they are going to be down my throat every bite. But really, they worked it like a charm. They came when they needed to and didn't come when they didn't need to come - all three of them. My water was constantly full as well. I really appreciated this.\n\nI want to go back here next time I am in town and do a few things differently. First, don't eat 3 hours before arriving. I was not all that hungry when I arrived and I felt like I was doing myself a disservice. Second, try something more to my liking such as chicken or steak. I have to give it a 4.5 but yelp doesn't allow a half mark. I feel that the main part of the meal was the weakest which is the main reason you are there so I am rounding down to 4-stars. Maybe if I enjoyed the main course a little more (not that it was bad) then I would have given it a straight 5-stars.\n\nI'll be back.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	1DsuFRjdW0gDA23Xswzoqg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
E0E2_WwvlLRAdEcQIVIy2w	5	2008-08-25 00:00:00	This place was amazing, probably the best meal I have ever had in my life.  I came here with my boyfriend at the time, for an early dinner.  We arrived earlier than our reservation, so while we were waiting we were looking at the menu outside to see what we would have. \n\n I thought I had made my decision, but once inside we found out that the chef makes something special each day.  So of course this is what I decided on ordering, and so did he.  Which I was a little bummed because I was hoping he would order something different so we can share.  Our dish was served in a large bowl, and it was a sampling of pork, beef and chicken that was served over garlic mash potatoes.   We also ordered the caesar salad prepared table side.  This was very impressive and of course delicious.\n\nFor desert I chose the banana cream pie and he chose the double chocolate fudge cake.  They were both superb, which I wasn't expecting any less.\n\nThe service is impeccable.  I have never been to a restaurant this nice and I felt like a queen for the time that we were there.  There were just two of us, but be had three servers attending our table.  While we were waiting to be seated we sat in the bar and we were watching a basketball game.  The maitre d' noticed and kept us updated throughout our dinner with the score.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	g3Jap6imvW3hliYHvfilTw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
E12bnNfr8idDbgPo3DCdrw	5	2013-06-28 00:00:00	Delicious- from the cocktails to the steaks! Apps: We tried the oysters and bbq shrimp (holy yum!). Entrees: Our party of 6 had all steaks (filet, ribeye and bone-in ribeye) which were all cooked to perfection. One ribeye was very fatty but that's to be expected with that cut and the portion size of the steaks is so that there was plenty to be found that was free of fat- seriously, these steaks are HUGE, definitely share-worthy. Sides: Creamed Corn (VERY yum!), Sauteed Mushrooms (yum), Mashed potatoes (how can you go wrong) and a Twice Baked Potato (a little over done on the bottom but still good regardless). We enjoyed the service and the experience overall. Would highly recommend!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	1yXkf6PcnXCtGGhCLcI84w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I realize that top shelf restaurants in Las Vegas are pricey, but discriminating judgment should not be thrown out the window completely. Delmonico's is easily in the bottom third of dining options on the Strip, and maybe even that is too generous. There are at least 5 better options in The Venetian alone. \n\nI've had better rib eye steaks for $0.99. Their wine list sucks, too. I expect an upcharge but if I'm going to pay through the nose, at least give me something that wasn't fermented in a toilet.\n\nSkip Delmonico's. Don't spend your winnings at a crappy, over hyped restaurant. And if you're down, why add insult to injury?	0	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	dpZWgtMN31-mW-buqZGOyQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The Truffle Chips (home cut potato chips tossed in truffle oil, garlic, parmesan, and green onions) are rediculously addictive!

E5rcA4uUXOesG-knXaEWQQ	4	2016-03-11 00:00:00	A friend and I came here a few nights ago, and upon walking in without a reservation we were accommodated immediately. Score! I think we got lucky since it was only 6ish but I recommend making reservations, especially as it was packed when we walked out by 7:30.\n\nOur waiter was incredibly helpful as we sorted through the menu and wine items. I ended up getting the porkchop while my friend got the bone-in ribeye. We also shared the cream corn and garlic smashed potatoes. Our food was served quickly and the red wines we ordered were fantastic - the Tobin James was darker than I usually like it but rich and paired very well with the ribeye. My Meiomi was a bit lighter and fruitier but was a great recommendation for its price.\n\nBe prepared for a BIG meal, the slabs of meat are huge and we barely got through half of our sides. So come hungry! Both the porkchop and ribeye were delicious - flavorful, tender, and juicy. Several waiters came by to check on us which was appreciated.\n\nThe only reason I'm docking a star is for the decor - a bit plain and out of the 90s. Lighting is perfectly dim but hopefully they renovate to match the prices. To be clear though, this is not a reason to not come - the dinner will be worth it!	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	1WpYGy2ByT25RlXMhe29XQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
E5ZQzrRLICRBgIRErpJT9g	2	2011-04-21 00:00:00	The food was average at best.  The exceptionally high prices and the quality of the dishes do not match up.  Wife and I chose Delmonico based on reviews.  We left disappointed. The service is what you would expect to find at any high end restaurant.  All of our dishes lacked flavor and the quality of the ingredients were not there as well.  I am really not sure how this place is so well reviewed.  Coming from Boston we could go out every night for three months for a fantastic dinner and never revisit the same restaurant.  With that maybe we are spoiled.  Our bill for the two of us at the end of the night was $250.  Being generous I would say that dinner was worth maybe a third of the cost.  \n\nThe next night we sat at the bar at Seablue in the MGM for a couple of cocktails. I got talking with the bartender and told him about dinner the previous night.  He said "ooh, I wouldn't go there.  I was there years ago and found it to be extremely overpriced and the food just not that good.  I've heard lots of people say not great things about their Delmonico visit." Coincidentally, if you are in the MGM during happy hour visit the Seablue. Shrimp Cocktail are $1 each and are huge.  Coming from the east coast I wouldn't eat shrimp in the desert but on the bartenders recommendation we got some. They were excellent.\n\nIf the restaurant wasn't in the Venetian and visited by thousands of tourists I would guess it would go out of business rather quickly.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	EtE25eD05E18qApJkWvAvw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

eA3hnRdUFMkA5UJyIMJd0Q	4	2015-11-30 00:00:00	My husband and I ate here for Thanksgiving dinner and really enjoyed our meal. \n\nI've eaten at many steakhouses in the area and I find that each one has their own unique style. Delmonico's interior isn't highly decorated or cluttered, just a simple and clean look. I liked the simplicity. \n\nOur waiter and his team were very attentive. Water glasses were constantly filled, plates cleared efficiently, and service moved smoothly. They were all very professional. \n\nThe meal begins with popovers that are both soft and flavorful. I began my meal with the Wilted Spinach and Frisee salad. It was anything, but the usual frisee salad because every ingredient was taken to the next level. The bacon vinaigrette had a nice smoky bacon flavor which was tossed in just the right amount with the spinach. The candied bacon was amazing. They perfectly balanced the sweet and salty. The egg on top was cooked to perfection. All of the flavors worked so well together. \n\nIt was hard to order something other than steak, but it was Thanksgiving so I had to have my traditional dinner. The Thanksgiving dinner didn't disappoint and was a very generous portion. The turkey was very moist and flavorful. The plate had a nice mix of white and dark meat. Under piles of turkey was a moist, delicious cornbread stuffing. A delicious gravy was drizzled over the turkey and stuffing. There was a small side of green beans, but those were not the best thing on the plate as they were a stringy and mushy.\n\nMy husband and I split a Twice Baked Potato because you have to have potatoes on Thanksgiving. I'm glad we split because it was definitely enough for two. The potato was flavorful and covered in a nice cheese layer.\n\nFor dessert I had the Pecan Pie and my husband had the Thanksgiving dessert special. My Pecan Pie was served like a tart in a small round, flaky crust. The crust was buttery and flaky. I don't like crust usually, but this was very good. There was plenty of gooey pecan filing and a nice heap of ice cream on top. My husband's special dessert was a trio of pumpkin cheesecake, bread pudding, and ice cream. This kind of fell flat. Nothing had much flavor and was certainly not the best representation of the dessert menu.\n\nI can't wait to return and try more of the regular menu items.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We were lucky enough to have "Vinnie" to help us selecting the right wine for both the rib eye steak and the fish dish.\nWill definitely go back when in Vegas.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	XI23ds_gJSJRnaEaN0MC9g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

eCJObv4SZupXH5TKWaUhSg	2	2015-10-23 00:00:00	Very busy and noisy restaurant.\nAsparagas was cooked perfectly, however quite flavorless. The mashed potatoes were tasty.  \nFor the price, the spinach should have been fresh and the cream sauce needs improvement. \nMy organic filet was good and nicely cooked to medium rare, however not near as tasty as other organic beef I have had for half the price.\nThe New Orleans gumbo was a tad too salty.  The yorkshire style buns were average and were cold.  \nThe key lime pie was average.  The tartness was lacking.  The apple pie was a disappointment, with a doughy flavoured crust.\nAnother thing that  high end restaurants need to learn is how to choose great coffees like good wines.  I asked where the beans were from and they had no idea.  I would expect excellence in all areas of my food consumption and yes, even with my coffee. The espresso was extremely poor.\nThis is a restaurant that is way overpriced for average to good tasting food.  Nothing was outstanding or excellent.\nSo I can only give it a rating of 2 combining value and flavour.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	SFftbQSwHZ24ahhfj5vVxQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
eEIjRsMK34SdDUb2NtaO_Q	5	2015-06-28 00:00:00	Stayed at the Venetian and they were advertising how good this restaurant was, so we decided to try it. I was a bit unsure...because the front of the restaurant looked empty (good places are always full!). So we still made reservations and when we arrived we discovered that the actual restaurant portion of the steak house was in a different area and it was a full night!. Our waiter recommended the bone in rib eye which is aged and is their signature plate, and the mashed potatoes. This steak was the best!!! I could not believe how good it was. It was seared and just so good. One order of mashed potatoes is really big so our waiter recommended we shared. We did not even finish that 1 order of tasty mashed potatoes. The service was attentive, and since I love martinis they made me a peach martini.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	7sH_HM1FMYWcFwCL4Jyu4g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
EfhPbuAFycNbV8YhibhtSg	4	2015-04-26 00:00:00	We came here for my husbands birthday dinner.  We were a few minutes early so had drinks in the lounge, A Tale Of Two Cherries and Louisiana Hard Tea.  Drinks were good and packed a punch.  We started with Barbecue Shrimp and Fried Green Tomatoes.  Barbecue shrimp was the same as at Emeril's other restaurants.  Delicious.  I only wish you got more then 4 shrimp and 1 tiny biscuit.  The fried green tomatoes were one of the nights specials.  They were topped with lump crap and fried light and crisp.  For our Entrees I got Emeril's Barbecue Salmon, he got Bone In Ribeye.  We chose Twiced Baked Potato and Grits for our sides.  Salmon and steak were both wonderful and cooked perfectly.  The sides were creamy and rich, but very similar in flavor.  We loved them both but probably should have order something with more variety.  We finished with Banana Cream Pie and Caramel Butter Cake for dessert.  The Banana Cream Pie is Emeril's signature dessert that is served in all his restaurants.  Hubby loves it and it's a must order for us.  It was our first time ordering the Caramel Butter Cake and it didn't disappoint.  It was served warm and covered in gooey caramel.  Service started off slow, but got better as the meal went on.  We had incorrect charges on our bill that were quickly corrected when we brought it to our servers attention.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	XXKjsdglgwSs9kWtK6ZWUQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
efQwMLnH943frcyjLO46SQ	4	2016-03-21 00:00:00	I went to Vegas most recently having made reservations at Delmonico ahead of time.  This is my 6th Emeril restaurant to visit. The French style of serving is charming, as always, and the management at this location were eager to please.  We felt a bit rushed at the beginning when our salads arrived seemingly almost immediately after we ordered, but they slowed the pace at our request so that we could savor the experience.  Neither of us were disappointed in our food, and the dessert was quite good.  The barbeque shrimp, if you've never had it, is definitely worth ordering.  But nothing left us talking about it afterword...  \nWhile Delmonico is not going to leave you hungry, it may not leave you marveling, either.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	6H40K6iKmP9LORYXqeO3qA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We had a reservation for 8 and Delmonicos and everyone almost hated their steak or fish. I myself had a halibut, but also shared the ribeye. I also had a taste of the lobster bisque. the bisque was very good and could recommend that. but as for the halibut and steak, they were very salty. our whole table said the same thing about the steak and fish. we were very surprised that we were disappointed at an emeril restaurant. maybe the chef in the back had a bad day. in the end, you wont see me here again.	0	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	mwuoYvFFchnNKaC1Gnw5Gg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
ejBfCE3ysmLr0jhNbANyNA	4	2012-02-22 00:00:00	Came here for a celebration, the only reason I chose this place was because I am a HUGE fan of banana cream pie, and all the reviews on here were raving about it. So I figured why not?! \n\nRight away, you realize that this place is trying to be something special. I say trying because it doesn't quite get it right. You do have 2 servers, and they pay attention to every little detail, which is great. I mean I was only thinking that i needed another iced tea, and before I could signal for one, the server had one ready for me. Great!!!\n\nHowever, I got the feeling everyone was trying a little to hard, I could tell only because everyone was so nervous and stumbling either over their words or the presentation of the food. \n\nFood wise, the food was GREAT! The steak was literally falling apart, I didn't even have to use any force at all to cut my filet. It was like thick beef jerky, if you can imagine that!!!\n\nHighly Recommended!!!!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	cIIDtvIwhvXECeTLaoI64g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
eJOr9NpaLwV9pfabLlGNgg	5	2010-01-13 00:00:00	People looking for a steak fix should definitely head over here for a yummy steak. The salad was a absolutely delicious. The mushrooms melted in my mouth and were just so good.\nMy wife and I both had soup as an appetizer, Something this place is very well known for. I had the shrimp gumbo, now that was great gumbo. My wife had the fillet minion and I tried the Cajun Steak which was just so tender and juicy, talk about perfection here.\nWe also had the asparagus, how perfectly cooked.\nI decided to have a yummy baked potato with my dinner,  butter and sour cream right along with it. Delmonico is by far the best steakhouse I have ever been to in Las Vegas.\nThe waiter  was very friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. The owner is the great Emeril Lagasse, the guy that yells BAM!!!! on his cooking show. Come here if you want the best steak ever.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	IpI4NsEHYeAPLTRLppcHNQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
EK7lnfsD-v76YrDs7bzOWw	4	2011-01-27 00:00:00	Since this was my birthday trip we wanted(I wanted) a great steak dinner. As if I need a reason for a good piece of meat. We arrive 15 mins before our reservation and within 2 mins are seated. The place looks like an art museum very light and earthy colors. The seats are a bit uncomfortable as someone also stated. They are leather office chair styled, I kept sliding off of them. Now enough of that, the food: the server: Darren comes around and gives us menus we look it over- I see what I'm ordering- the filet $48, side $9 and I also want an appetizer $18 damn $80 and that's just my meal. Now I'm used to spending this on sushi so I wasn't vexed. My poor husband who until me, wasn't used to spending so much on a meal was sweating. Ha! I'm just kidding, so to be semi fair we order the gumbo $10 split, the bread they have is phenomenal a cross between hawaiian bread & monkey bread, and it gets served one by one for each person.  Kind of annoying because it's that good but it comes out fresh so one can't complain. The gumbo is decent enough for a restaurant such as this. We order the chateaubriand $105 for a beautiful piece of steak, garlic smashed potatoes, and asparagus for two. Bam! Look @ me saving us money. This was our first time having the chateaubriand and this will not be my last, very well seasoned w/ herbs& spices and nice encrusted char. It was more than enough food for two. And @ the end of our meal they brought me a candle lit sorbet sweet treat for the bday girl. Our service was top notch from start to finish. A well worth $200.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	KKX_gOcdhUGFq02WDYCvXw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The bone-in ribeye, beef tartar, and every other appetizer we ordered was delicious. The meat didn't have too much fat which was the best part. Other steakhouses will serve your steak with bigger chunks of fat, so I felt like I was getting my money's worth here. The service was okay. Dress code tip: It's a nice restaurant but not extremely fancy.	1	0	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	OBi6VtRDBge6sb726AzNzg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

ElmeJ8CxcOoU4rsBdQk4Xg	3	2012-10-17 00:00:00	I was actually disappointed a bit by my meal at Delmonico's. I got the duck and it was overcooked. The cane syrup sauce did help bring out the flavor but it was still well done and I was not given the option when I ordered the duck as to how rare/well done I would like it. I do understand that it is a steakhouse, however if it is on the menu it needs to be of equal quality as the red meat.\nAlso, I tasted the mint ice cream profiteroles and the bread pudding served with butter pecan ice cream. Both house made ice creams were the best I'd ever tasted with a fantastic creaminess and balanced flavor, however the bread in both desserts were superfluous, didn't add anything and just weren't that spectacular.\nThe service we received was fantastic.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Dz4Au9z8BFosL36Bp8EkUA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Service was pretty prompt as usual with this place. We ordered the Caesar Salad that was prepared table side, I believe I ordered a  bone in rib-eye and my girlfriend ordered the salmon. All of the food was prepared well and service was perfection.

EPkI68FHML9YSz6AULNNeQ	4	2009-05-04 00:00:00	While at Vegas, our friends out of the blue, wanted to go eat at a nice restaurant for dinner since it was fight night and all the clubs would have a long line. They made the reservations around 4pm for a 9:30pm dinner, so making reservations last minute isn't a problem.\n\nThough we arrived on time, we had to wait at least 15 minutes to get seated, so we just waited at the bar. I thought the bar area looked better than the actual dining area itself. It was modern and sleek, with a piano situated at the far side of the room.\n\nOur hostess took us into the dining area, where we were immediately greeted by our smiling waitress. Very attentive, nice, and down to earth, explained the specials and menu to us. Meanwhile, the busboys/girls gave us hot bread, which my Filipino friends said tasted like Filipino bread. It was topped with finely grated cheese and salt, and they loved it. Our waters were constantly refilled before it was even half empty.\n\nWe all ordered either the rib-eye off the bone ($42), or the bone in rib-eye ($46). 14 to 16 oz. for the rib-eye. I tried both the steaks and they tasted the same to me. It was dry-aged 14 days, which you could tell when you sliced the meat with your knife. Tender, flavorful, delicious! I loved that the sides were encrusted with pepper and salt. My other friend ordered the filet-mignon, which she could not finish. I loved how it melted in your mouth and it was also very flavorful. We got the country smashed potatoes, the baked idaho potato, and the roasted fingerling potatoes. The roasted fingerling potatoes tasted the best. I thought it was perfect the way it was salted. The other 2 potatoes didn't stand out to me. \n\nDecor was minimal and sort of disappointing. The bathrooms were kind of disgusting to me because it seemed as if they didn't clean it much. The meal was delicious, but I still love Mastro's more! \n\nAt the end of our meal, one of the waiters kept coming by our table asking us if we needed help with our bill (because we had a party of 9). He came FIVE TIMES. It was SUPER annoying and it seemed that he was afraid we'd dine and run or something just because it was taking awhile for us to figure out how to calculate tax and tip and collecting money from people.\n\nI'd definitely come here again, but after I try other steakhouses in Vegas!	3	3	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	q9Tyln685OEpIWFUdTxoYg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

epkTQaP_uuJaUtou8Gn8Pw	5	2011-01-13 00:00:00	Just hit this place for the 3rd time in 2 years and this place never let's down.  I was there just this past weekend during a very busy time at the Venetian with 2 major conventions going on.  We were fortunate enough to get a reservation with the host we prefer at 7:30 pm.  Game on!!\n\nService is impeccable.  We have a specific host who takes care of us when we come in so I suggest you get to know yours cause it does make getting reservations much easier.  Not only that, but you have a better time in general when you feel you have a friend there.  And trust me, I'm no high roller.\n\nEach section has its own host and several supporting cast.  Some hosts are better than others so again if you like yours try to stick with him/her.  They usually start you with an amuse bouche compliments of the chef.  Always different and always outstanding.  It's no meal just a way of getting your taste buds started.  The food will be brought as per normal or as you request.  You're in control so let them know what you want and they will help you better.  Even with wine selections of which they have a large selection.  The place can get a lot of hustle (not normal) so just try to sit tight and enjoy your meal.  They won't rush you so don't rush yourself.  \n\nI go straight for the steak but i hear the appetizers are fantastic.  I highly recommend the Wet/Dry Aged Bone In Rib Eye Medium.  The outside will be crusted just right with a pat of house made butter on top.  Inside will be pink and juicy (order med/rare if you want blood) and soft not chewy.  The meat will melt in your mouth as this cut has just the right amount of marbling (great now I want one).  Desert?  The steak is desert enough for me (lol).  \n\nService is impeccable.

ePrCljzAkBpfoAJLv7JhyQ	5	2008-08-17 00:00:00	I really like Delmonico's.  I've dined here multiple times and have never been disappointed in either the service or the food.  We decided to have lunch here on our most recent Vegas excursion.  My dad tried to get reservations for noon, but was told that they could seat us at 12:30pm instead.  No biggie.\n\nWhen we arrived, there were only about two other tables occupied.  Not sure why we couldn't come in at noon, but whatever.  We ordered the potato chips with truffle oil and parmesan as our app.  I never thought of potato chips as a gourmet dish, but now I know better.  Excellent!\n\nMy sister and I split the salmon which had a bbq-esque sauce and was served with onion strings.  The waiter actually asked how we would like to have our salmon prepared.  I've never had a waiter ask that before.  Pretty cool.  We also shared a side of broccoli (gotta eat your veggies) and the twice baked potato with white cheddar and bacon (OMG!).  So yummy!\n\nFor dessert we all split two of the infamous banana cream pies.  Can you say holy banana goodness?  Another OMG moment!  In all honesty, that pie is one of the main reasons we went to Delmonico's.  ;)\n\nI would highly recommend dining at Delmonico's if you are in the neighborhood.  Be prepared for a leisurely meal (service can be slow, but it is relaxing) and some delicious food.  Bon appetit!	2	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	uP8qLiZr5zH_5ziDL37S5A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
eRbtijt7JVUTa4dadSGkyA	5	2010-01-14 00:00:00	I've been to Ruth's, Mastro's, The Palm, & Morton's and I will have to say that the Rib-Eye (not bone-in) I had here was the BEST I have ever had (not that the others were bad). \n\nI may be partial to the spice "rub"/"crust" they put on it which is not traditional for high end steak places which favor only salting their meat, but honestly I wish other places seasoned their meats a little more. It was truly delicious. My brother ordered the NY and my aunt ordered the Filet and they were both in agreement I had the best tasting steak.\n\nThe service was exactly what you would expect and demand from a place in this price range and all the sides and appetizers were definitely good (but not great).\n\nTheir wine list is literally an encyclopedia of wine so it was a little intimidating and I opted for a glass of Scotch instead. \n\nIn comparison to some of the newer & flashier spots like SW & CUT the ambiance is a little muted but its still classy. Like I stated, go here and order the regular Rib Eye.. I highly doubt you will be disappointed.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	C6Uj-sctPmGObOWSXxBP6w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

erQJPR7pqK9X0nCLfg-AUQ	3	2014-04-01 00:00:00	I went to Delmonico with a large group for a friend's birthday recently.  There were about 20 of us, split up over 3 circular tables.  It would have been great to have one long table, but I understand the constraint.  We were seated as soon as the birthday girls arrived after having a drink at the bar.  The service was excellent!  There were a lot of us and the staff was courteous and knowledgable about the menu and the wine list.  \n\nLet me preface my review of the food by saying that I don't eat red meat.  I know steak is their speciality, so I was knowing order what they don't go best.  I started with the shrimp cocktail, which included 4 large shrimp, cocktail sauce and some garnish.  The shrimp were cooked very well, but it was a regular shrimp cocktail.  The cajun marinade imparted a little extra kick, but nothing remarkable.  Next, I had the snapper entree.  Almost everyone else at my table ordered the rib eye, which was enormous.  Like Man vs. Food big.  The piece of snapper looked so tiny in the bowl next to the big steaks!  In all honesty though, it was a regular portion.  The lentils were a great addition, as were the brussel sprouts.  However, the fish seemed to have been sitting out for a while.  The top was dry like it had been under the heat lamps.  I understand that it's tough to coordinate one peice of fish when you have to prepare 15+ rib eyes for the same set of tables, but that snapper still cost me $40.  I didn't have dessert since we brought a cake, but the coffee at the end was good.  I'm not saying that I wouldn't return to Delmonico, but knowing there are so many other steakhouses in Vegas that have a stronger reputation for seafood, if it's my choice, I'd probably choose to go elsewhere.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	oZ_pZtv8ARgBlfOWdEWlbA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
eTGo4-j1r1QS70fyhamvSQ	4	2013-02-20 00:00:00	My mom lives in Vegas so I am there all the time and we try a lot of the nicer restaurants in town.  Delmonico Steakhouse was one of the better ones.  We were a little early for our reservation so we sat in the bar and ordered a few drinks.  The hostess then called our name after only a couple of minutes so we did not get our drinks in the bar but they brought them to the table and added them to our bill.  It was a very smooth process.  For dinner, I had the fillet Mignon with blue cheese melted on it.  It was delicious.  The steak was a tad undercooked for my taste but I did order medium rare.  I guess I was expecting the norm where other restaurants cook medium rare closer to medium.  But overall the steak was delicious.  Good flavor and I loved the blue cheese.  My mom had the rack of lamb.  Again a little too undercooked for her taste but they truly cooked it to medium rare.  We shared the twice baked potatoes with cheese and bacon.  Yummy!  The bread was good too.  We had a great main waiter and his assistants.  Everyone treated us well and in a timely manner.  Definitely a place I will go again.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	VdkAX9khigCjpMGuMNWYMQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
etLW7aP5cE0XyFyQGMsjYw	5	2016-10-16 00:00:00	There are many good steakhouses. This is a GREAT one. I had the shrimp cocktail which was excellent - big shrimp not over cooked. The wedge was great with real bacon and plenty of blue cheese crumbles. The bone-in ribeye was the best I have had. Great seasoning. Nice crust. Perfectly cooked. The banana creme pie was huge. Sinful. OMG I am so stuffed.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	FWBruzX-jFqWdeCStojSyQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

It was definitely the best dinner experience I had in Las Vegas. \n\nOne of the dishes was a quail which I normally am not fond of but they did such a good job I devoured it. The wine pairing was excellent and they were generous with their pours. I even took a full glass back to my room at the end of the night. Excellent service and food!

All the steaks at our table were perfectly prepared (including a non-butterflied Medium well steak).  Ambiance was free of "BAM!", very rich, elegant, a little loud, but leaves little to be desired. \n\nService was excellent, insane wine list, insane coffee list, limited Emeril.\n\nI will be back here for another special occasion or business dinner soon.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	zo4Y3qadH45LF1UVez1SuQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Went with a group of 9 and ordered the "surf and turf" consisting of the ribeye and a seafood mashed potato combo.\n\nThe good - Mashed potatoes were excellent, generous lump seafood, very tasty.  Side dishes also were excellent.\n\nThe disappointing - The ribeye.  Ordered it medium rare, as did my friend next to me.  Both of our steaks were probably cooked closer to medium, neither was juicy or tender, there seemed to be no marbled fat content at all, and the texture was almost grainy.\n\nI'll eat everything from In N Out to more foodie type establishments, always with a smile on my face, but this experience was a bit of a shock to me.  I've had ribeyes for 1/3 the price but infinitely better.  \n\nWeird.  But I think I'd rather try somewhere else as I wouldn't want a repeat experience at that price point.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Rf7QN0oJ17j2J_bz6MjgRw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

They recommended dishes for us based on our likes. It really felt like they were committed to ensuring we were well cared for during our entire time. When we ordered coffee one of our friends went to the restroom. We were all enjoying our coffee when she returned. No sooner had she sat down one of the servers filled her cup so it would be nice and hot. It's those special touches that make this place so special. Now for the food. Delicious! The bone in ribeye is amazing and the salmon is delightful. The sides are served family style and honestly you cannot go wrong with any of them. We loved the corn dish was our favorite. We cannot thank the staff enough for such a wonderful dining experience.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	_jPKZWg_bOsApmzvLXJtHw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Service was very attentive.  We left happy.  Will probably head back after experiencing some more of what Vegas has to offer.  So much to see... so little time!\n\nI would give it 4.5 stars if I could, but I am going to have to agree about the ambiance - a bit on the bright side (sights n'sound).  In the end, Delmonico's seemed to be a consistent and classic dining experience.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	rXPr0xPW51c0hrrNbuuPGA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
ezRKl2jzWD2bViAR8TjcLw	5	2017-06-29 00:00:00	Back to Delmonico three more times for great Louisiana Caviar atop sumptuous Deviled Eggs; light and airy Popovers; mellow Lobster Bisque; traditional black New Orleans Gumbo; fine French Onion Soup; Caesar Salad prepared tableside; buttery medium rare Creekstone Prime Grade Filet Mignon paired with perfectly seasoned Duck Fat Fingerling Potatoes; a nice mix of Garlic Sauteed Mushrooms; coffee prepared with Jamaican coffee beans; amazingly delicious Emeril's Banana Cream Pie with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, and Whipped Cream; very memorable Pecan Pie with Oatmeal Shortbread Crust, Vanilla Ice Cream, and Caramel Sauce; and most recently for lunch during Restaurant Week a humongous 15-ounce Prime Grade medium rare Bacon Cheeseburger on a Sesame-Seeded Brioche Bun dressed with tomato slices, lettuce, White Onions, ketchup, and mayo topped by a juicy pickle segment accompanied by very tasty homemade lightly browned French Fries glistening with a sheen of Duck Fat.  \n\nOnce Diane did not receive her Maitre-D Butter, and her steak arrived with some char and pepper after her specific request not to.  But otherwise food preparation and service were impeccable and working in tandem like a well-oiled machine.  When an apparent miscommunication resulted in receipt of Sauteed Spinach instead of Creamed Spinach, a side of Creamed Spinach was voluntarily and quickly brought to the table as well, without charge.  Both dishes were outstanding.\n\nOur Restaurant Week lunch culminated in a fine finish with a rich Banana Cream Pie Parfait with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream and Graham Crumbs for me; and traditional Bread Pudding with lip-smacking warm Caramel Pecan Sauce for Diane.  For us, based on past experiences, there is every reason to return again for more epicurean delights.	7	3	6	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
F2DAQ7hbIPagEm-YB9udew	2	2012-02-10 00:00:00	Had the occasion to eat here recently and although it was gook, it honestly didn't meet my expectations.  Of course everyone is going to have different expectations. Maybe because it's Emeril's but I was expecting just something much better.  \n\nWe had a party of 6 and they seated us at this huge round table.  You had to talk very loudly in order for the other side of the table to hear you, which just contributes to the already loud atmosphere.  \n\nThe food was on par for a steak house of this caliber though a little on the high side, which is premium you pay for the Lagasse name.  I can't review anything that already hasn't been said.  I had the rib eye which was good, sides I can't even remember.  Bread as others have mentioned was not memorable.  I'll have to disagree with others about the banana cream pie..  just didn't seem to have the flavor I was expecting.. just a lot of not sweet enough whipped cream.\n\nService was great though.\n\nWill probably not go back.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Zr35L4XoRimzGA7w1LX7aQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Word is he signed a contract with MGM properties so no other place on the strip can use his name outside of the MGM properties. The only mention you will see is his first name mentioned in the dessert selection, other than that nothing.\n\nThe atmosphere is nice and the waiter service is killer. However the food was lacking, the steak although cooked to perfection lacked some flavor and they do not mention how large the steaks are. Thepetit filet mignon was tiny, six ounces for sixty dollars which included three overcooked shrimp lobster topped. \n\nThe frog legs were good, a different for once and their selection of fine drinks is a good selection.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	19uBC840gZ-BrIfI3Fae4w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The steaks were flavorless and not cocked as requested. The side of broccoli was lukewarm and wine glasses were dirty. The best part of the meal was the caramel butter cake dessert and Fisticuffs cabernet.  We go to steakhouses quite often and Delmonico's ranks towards the very bottom of our list.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4pbbNuzxlZ9E52wsVhgGig	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
F2hzf4Asc_AMg88-0OJYSQ	4	2014-04-21 00:00:00	We had dinner reservations to celebrate a special event. We started off with a few drinks.\n\nFried Soft-Shell Crab:\nAn appetizer with poached egg, frisee salad and lemon truffle vinaigrette. Lightly breaded and fried. Not greasy, not fatty and the shell was definitely soft. The citrusy salad compliments the dish. One of the best soft-shell crab versions I've had. We got 2 orders of these - they were that good. 5/5\n\nFilet Mignon:\nSince I'm not a fan of animal fat, this is what I normally get. Some people may find it boring but I like my steak simple and lean. Very tender and cooked to a perfect medium-rare. This piece of meat didn't photograph very well since it looks so dark from all the pepper but it tasted good. 4/5\n\nChateaubriand:\nThe second most tender and lean cut of meat. We got mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. 4/5\n\nBone-In Ribeye:\nDry-aged prime with butter on top. Superb! 4/5\n\nFoie Gras:\nThis was a side item. Perfectly seared and mildly sweet. You don't really need to do much to make foie gras taste good. KISS (keep it simple, stupid!) 4.5/5\n\nMushrooms with Garlic:\nThis side was really good. I love mushrooms and garlic. The mushrooms did not have just a hint of garlic. They were deliciously garlicky. 5/5\n\nGrits:\nThis has bacon and good melted cheese which makes this more interesting than it should be. I wouldn't normally eat grits but this was good. 4/5\n\nCreme Brulee:\nI've been feeling tired of this dessert. I didn't find joy in eating this. Plain, ordinary and too safe. 2/5\n\nDelmonico Coquetel:\nGin, sparkling dessert wine, five spice-infused simple syrup, ruby red grapefruit and lime juices. Their signature cocktail...but why? Our server was right, I should've not wasted my time on this. It was too sweet and it just didn't taste right. I took a few sips and our server knew it was time for a different drink. 2/5\n\nA Tale of Two Cities:\nCherry vodka, elderflower liqueur, black cherry juice and citrus juices. This was deliciously amazing if you like cherry. 5/5\n\nAnother drink we had was a martini with bleu cheese-stuffed olives. Since I'm not a fan of martini, olives or bleu cheese - it would not be fair for me to rate this. We got a free chocolate gelato and it was good. Service was good. Our server gave us recommendations and what to stay away from. Honesty is always appreciated.	4	3	4	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

f8dozFXtQRtM3pIjw2tNqQ	4	2014-02-14 00:00:00	What better way to celebrate a big 3-0 than with a mean piece of steak! It was my good friend's birthday and we had two tables reserved for our big group. I must say, service was stellar. Staff was knowledgeable with their menu and very patient with us when placing our orders in as we were all quite indecisive and had so many questions.   \n\nStarting off with some bread and aperitif, I chose a glass of Blue label Chimay as my poison. Ahhhh...a wonderful prelude to an evening of indulgence. For appetizers, I had their OYSTER ROCKEFELLER. This baked aphrodisiac was not as cheesy as I hoped it would be but they were fresh and of good quality. I can't complain. \n\nNext came the main show, BONE-IN RIBEYE which my man and I split. Split plating was beautifully done with the perfect portion for each of us. No fee for split plate, thank you. I like my meat cooked medium and it came as pink as I expected it to be. A dollop of butter topped off my steak but that for me was unnecessary. It had quite a chew to it which was unlikely coming from Chef Emeril Lagasse's kitchen. Did it taste bad? No, not at all. I just think that being in Vegas where you are surrounded by a plethora of dining options of the same caliber, you need to live up to your name. Sadly, I wasn't as impressed by this dish compared to other fellow Yelpers. \n\nMy side of choice was the CREAMED SPINACH. Now we're talking! It tasted sensational with that silky feel of butter and cream. Finally, Chef Emeril's true colors are coming out. And on a sweet note, we ended the evening with EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE. Can I say, WOW!? I will have to say this was the best banana cream pie I've had to date. Hats off to you, Chef! This my friends, earned Delmonico Steakhouse the 4 stars I'm giving them. \n\nWould I come back? Sure! I'll skip the steak and try his southern specialties instead. But more importantly, I shall not forget EMERIL'S BANANA CREAM PIE. It's to die for!	13	10	13	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	kFtpOzWygqAENd6oKrkefw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We were celebrating our anniversary, and they provided both an appetizer and dessert for free.The atmosphere is casual elegant, not stuffy, but very beautiful in a simple way.  You must try the Caesar salad, made for two at the table, AMAZING!!  We both had a steak, my NY Strip not quite as flavorful as partner's Rib Eye, which was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten.  The entire meal experience was unforgettable, and the pricetag, although steep, was worth it. We will return.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	erhCDyzsC2OZavUhieleIg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Fa0pLbXtohno-4HpGhOGGA	3	2012-08-06 00:00:00	It has been a few years since my 1 and only visit. I recall it being highly overrated. I am from Texas and have been to many steakhouses. First of all, the high-end white tablecloth fancy decor with everyone in suits and ties is not fitting for a steakhouse.\n\nThe steaks were not memorable and I have had much better for less money.  I do not recall if the steaks are grilled or broiled but I do recall mine was overcooked and for such a high-end fancy place, I would expect better.\n\nIf you are looking for quality steak in Vegas and willing to spend some cash, I would try many others before this place.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	pz1HWfUdT4JPwh7HiynyEA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
fa4cPixXKpCxUHGGB3yuLg	2	2013-09-29 00:00:00	Went to Emril's Delmonico last night for dinner and to sum up the experience was grossly underwhelmed from start to finish.\n\nAtmosphere: the general atmosphere and ambiance is exactly what you'd expect from a fine-dining Casino restaurant. Clean and well-kept. \n\nService: The service was generally pretty good from the two support staff assisting our primary server. Our main server, however, was quite underwhelming to say the least. It was apparent from the moment he greeted us that he wasn't enthused to have a 2 top sit down (at a table for 2 no less). I mentioned to the server that I was interested in an appetizer to share, but didn't want something so large as to prevent me from fully enjoying the steak I had decided on. He ignored my question for a suggestion. I've never had that happen, anywhere, let alone a fine-dining establishment. The worst part, however, came to the bill. To set the stage, we were seated adjacent to two other 2-top tables, one of which was behind us in the meal progression, the other who was ahead of us. Several moments after our dessert and after dinner-drinks were dropped off, our bill was placed on our table with the statement "I'll take this as soon as you are ready." Interesting . . . I looked at the table next to us, who had already finished dessert and they did not have their bill yet. And on top of that, he failed to ask us if we wanted anything else, which had he asked, he would have realized that my wife would have liked more hot water for her tea. My wife was also thoroughly irritated with the fact that the bill was explicitly placed within my reach, and not hers. She made it a point to the server that she was the one who wished to pay.\n\nFood: We were both completely and 100% underwhelmed with everything we ordered. I had the "house special" which was a dry aged, bone-in ribeye, reportedly seasoned with Emril's Essence. It was a good steak. Not great by any means, and most certainly not worth the $52 price tag. The flavor was mediocre (surprising since its purportedly dry-aged), and the cook highly inconsistent. It was ordered medium rare, and parts were rare, others were medium. Very disappointing and suggestive of an amateur grill chef. I'm quite content to pay that much and far more for a good steak, however, I expect to get what I pay for, and this was most certainly not it. I've had far superior steaks for less than 1/2 that price.  My wife ordered the snapper, and it was so overcooked that it was mostly inedible. Also had the mushroom side, which was generally pretty good.\n\nThe dessert, however, was quite good. The banana creme pie.\n\nPerhaps we went on an off night, however, this experience coupled with the abundance of other restaurants on the strip, is enough for me to never return.	0	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	M_JB5tiXDnpoBTXYwzyIvQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
faBb7mhauXe4NkiMSO2YmQ	3	2015-02-21 00:00:00	Been here 4 times now. Was in the process of making this place one of those restaurants you gotta visit every time you come into town. Well, I don't feel that way so much any more after our last two visits\nService is outstanding.  No complaints when you're pampered.  But there are tons of staff which may explain the prices here. Looked to me like a 3 person team was assigned to 3 tables. Doesn't include the guy bringing the food or the floaters moving about \nThe quality of the food is merely average. 3 of us went, total bill was $360, no drinks.  The BBQ salmon was good, but the overpowering BBQ sauce hid the salmon flavor. My better half had the rack of lamb which she sent back for more cooking because it was raw in the middle. It came back hotter but nearly as raw. She gave up 1/2 through because of all the fat and the rawness. I tried a rib and found it average.  Costco has rack of lamb. Not as meaty but more flavorful than Delmonico.  But that depends on the chef. I had the bone in rib eye, asked for it med rare but it was mostly raw. The tail end was all fat. The flavor was average. For me, part of the cooking process is to turn a steak into a masterpiece. It starts with a prime cut of beef. Apparently, they were out of prime quality steers. This steak had no marbling, just huge fatty areas and lots of tough connective tissue. The tenderness and the tastiness you find in the outer rim of a rib eye wasn't there.  I had to saw through every piece of this steak. Maybe I had a crappy knife.  We had the cream corn and smashed potatoes, both were average. \nEverything here I could have made at home with better quality and with way more flavor for 1/4 the price. So I'll leave with Foodie's Helpful hints:\nStart with better quality ingredients. Learn what blue, rare, medium rare and so on are. Learn the point when to remove fish from the heat so it retains its natural flavors and moistness. Don't drown anything in sauce.  Spend some time in the kitchen outside working hours, experimenting, getting the broil and grill times right. Add alittle spice to the popovers might make them really stand out. Allow those steaks to sit outside the refrigerator to warm up before plopping them on a grill. It makes a huge difference  Add fresh corn to the creamed corn. Maybe that will add a little crunch instead of leaving a baby food texture. Liven up your tired old spuds. Liven up all your food.\nOverall the food quality is 2 stars. The service adds another star.   From now on, we will come here only for the $12 slice of Banana Cream Pie, which is to die for unless the quality starts slipping.	0	2	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	zO9kz3Y48I9s2BrLFg2ymA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The Calamari was good as was the steak tartare. Side dishes: New Orleans Creamed Spinach, Truffle Parmesan Potato Chips and Sautéed Garlic Mushrooms were all excellent!  The sides are quite large so please share because yeah, we ordered too many.\n\nTotal bill for 13 (which included some drinks) was about $1100 which is not bad for a nice high-end place that serves THE BEST RIBEYE.

Out of the 10 or so times I've been here, always with at least three others at a time or more, I've never had a bad meal. The steaks are superb (I love their bone in rib steak - too big to eat in one sitting -but I manage it anyway), along with their sides, and finally their banana creme pie is to die for - and I normally NEVER order this - I was converted in a hurry and convinced friends who thought I was nuts to try it - they too are converted followers.  Haven't been there in about six months, need to go back next trip soon.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ztgrRuhMQsrqnQw8XHhTVg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

FDCTeYBrFiCIeeWP6a5VhQ	5	2017-07-05 00:00:00	The thing about fine dining establishments is that there's a heck of a chance you'll leave without having had your fill, so you're encouraged to empty your wallet even more for all the trimmings.\n\nDon't make that mistake at Delmonico Steakhouse, even if everything looks and is delicious.\n\nAlmost everything at Emeril's restaurant here is sharable.  I was here for a couple friends' birthdays, and everybody at my table ordered one appetizer to go with the steaks we ordered.  As good as everything was, we just ended up staring at our food 20 minutes after being served.\n\nAs for the food, as I stated, it's all terrific.  The complimentary bread is some of the best I've ever had.  They're delicate to the touch, and when you bite into it, the texture is flakier than a croissant.  I didn't even know that was possible with a roll.  \n\nI had the lobster bisque as an appetizer, which was creamy and some decent chunks of lobster in it.  For the record, I actually finished it.  Another person at our table ordered the seafood tower which is something you should get on a big baller budget, but everything from the oysters, to the lobster, and crab claws were scrumptious.  The country smashed potatoes, sauteed garlic mushrooms, truffle parmesan potato chips, and duck fat fingerling potatoes?  All amazing.\n\nNow, the steak.  Most of them are dry-aged, so we're talking $$$ here, but like my fellow Yelper Ferdinand L. said, do not attempt to have a steak without the foie gras on top.  If you've never had foie gras before, this is the time to do it.  The result is something you'll simply salivate over.\n\nNow it wasn't the best steak I ever had, but it was one of those situations where after eating here, I know most things after will be a disappointment, so choose your next meal wisely.  My whole table had the meat stares, and only one person at the table finished their entree.\n\nJust a great dining experience.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	b4bTks98idS6-hx5AT92WQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
fdTI9qxDgVr_WYE-Pz_wSg	4	2015-12-28 00:00:00	Absolutely outstanding food.  Top notch.  The best.\n\nI had the Bone in NY Strip and it's the best steak I've had in recent memory.  I ordered a little side of horseradish on the side and the two went very well together.  The steak fries were great also.\n\nThe staff was great and took very good care of us.\n\nIt's a tad bit loud and the ambiance isn't great.\n\nBut if you want a good steak, you'd be hard pressed to find a better one than Delmonico's serves.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	RNKwQjJ3cKRUnsaTjB7NrQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
FfYvq7huTZHtezXsBFIRJg	3	2016-08-20 00:00:00	My wife and I just celebrated an anniversary here.  The food and servers were excellent and very friendly.  The Piedmontese New York was surprisingly good.\n\nWhat cost the restaurant a better rating was how we were greeted by the host staff.  While I was checking in, the hostess turned away to seat someone that just walked up as I was giving my name.  I was so surprised and offended that I was prepared to leave.\n\nAnother host saw this and quickly jumped in and had us seated right away.  Kudos to him for the save, but still there was no apology issued.\n\nFirst impressions are important.  We never expected anything like this at a restaurant of this caliber, especially one associated with Emeril Lagasse.	2	1	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	jirzlI1IOXIzd-h3xsuECQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
FIbRWb3oYVuak6KvBl4nCA	5	2016-08-01 00:00:00	I love a good steak. Filets are my favorite. I have to say that the Filet I had at the Delmonico Steakhouse was one of the best I've ever had. Maybe even the best. The char on it was perfect, the inside a perfect medium. If I had one complaint - it'd be that I didn't order two of them.\n\nThe side dishes and dessert were also delicious, and the service was amazing as well. Of course, the price was expensive, but I would hope no one going to this restaurant would be surprised by the price. You get what you pay for.\n\nI'm keeping the review short - if you don't mind paying good money for a great meal, then go here. You will not regret it.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ZXmKb-K0KST2b1LjiUI5bg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
fjlJ2g97E6y7JRZ9Dc55Rw	4	2011-08-04 00:00:00	Came here as a recommendation from my brother and his wife. They had only been here for their lunch, but we came for their dinner.\n\nEasy to make a reservation through yelp via open table. Confirmed.\n\nCame here and ordered their famous bone-in-ribeye. Had the oysters and shrimp for appetizer. Cream spinach as a side to share. \n\nOysters:\nSort of like the Rockerfeller oysters... I liked it. Not the best but it was good.\n\nShrimp:\nThe sauce was Louisiana style, good but the shrimp was cooked too long. It came out a little 'old'. \n\nBone in Ribeye:\nThe flavors were strong and was there. It had that distinct iron? grilled tast to it. Juicy as well but too chewy for me. Some parts were a bit dry.But it is huge!\n\nCreme spinach:\nToo salty for me but other then that, good.\n\nFood: a-ok, 3 stars.\nService: 5 stars.\n\nWhy? We told them we were going to catch the show for Ka at the MGM Grand and seating started at 7:30. They made sure everything came out fast and had our check ready for us so we would leave in time. I didn't feel rushed at all, and they were glad to help us out. Thank you! :)\n\nI would recommend going there once.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	q2A-MykoF5RZnVjWwt6V1g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

FNn_t7cltI6EDvNs91RG5w	5	2016-05-30 00:00:00	Let me start by saying I don't  eat red meat but I decided to try Delmonico Steakhouse because I knew  the other proteins and veggies would be delicious and I knew all the other people in our group would love it. I was not disappointed at all....the halibut was perfect.  Veggie on the table were severed family style which made it easy to share and try everything: mushrooms, broccoli, asparagus, mashed potatoes, twice baked potato, and regular baked potato.  The mushrooms were my personal favorite but everything was great. Other proteins  on our table: pork chop, rack of lamb, ribeye, NY strip, and filet mignon, while I didn't try them everyone in our group loved their dish, nothing but happy faces in our party. The service was stellar and the pop overs were mouth-wateringly delicious.  Also had the bbq shrimp appetizer and truffle potato chips both were great not a crumb left on the plate. Cocktail wise the Dorian Gray was sweet with a bit of punch at the end, I loved it. Overall I would love to return to Delmonico and perhaps leave room for dessert next time!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	_k7dNSeDjC2kD8ek1LvvLA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
fOaAK9xdO6y2qAU56D3sVw	4	2009-02-04 00:00:00	While staying at the Palazzo in Vegas during the CES & AEE convention's I had a great dinner at Delmonico's with a few new friends on a Friday night.\nWe did not make a reservation for the 4 of us, but the maitre' d Marty put a table together for us in about a 5 min wait. The place was packed!\nI guess it's the perk of being with "high rollers" aka "corporate cocks".\nNo, but seriously we had unbelievable service thanks to Marty's personal touch & our beautiful hostess Corrine. \nOur C.C's did the pleasure of doing the ordering for us ladies. I must give my C.C's credit because these 2 men had great taste!\nWe started with a very nice bottle of Pinot Noir, Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp, Truffle Parmesan Potato Chips, Lobster Bisque, a really good salad that was not on the menu per the request of my C.C friend Richard.\nThe lobster bisque was interesting, the chef bakes the lobster into a tasty biscuit that you can dip or crumble into the creamy bisque. \nWe also had Butternut Squash Ravioli both dishes brought me back to Delmonico's for 2nd's on Sunday night. Again, I was lucky enough to have Corrine as my hostess the 2nd time around. Thanks Corrine : )\nOur main course we had a very fine bottle of Cabernet not on the wine list but one of our Maitre' d Marty's personal fav's!\nWe each had the Bone In Ribeye Steak's they were huge!! Gigantor!!! \nI ate maybe a 1/4 of it!! \nTo compliment our BIG juicy rib eyes we had Vegetables of the Day & New Orleans Creamed Spinach. D'lish!\nWe had sooo much food I thought I was going to burst!\nAll though we were all stuffed some how we managed to end our meal with some coffee & dessert's,  Emeril's Banana Cream Pie (my personal fav. FYI I love cream pies ; p) & Chocolate Peanut Butter Torte. So sinful..... but not as sinful as two women in vegas baby!! \nWhat happens in Vegas stay's in Vegas!!!\nLet's just say our date's were not cheap and our bill was not small $$$$.	9	7	10	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Ux2e9mZftYA0lPTwXFmrZw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
foKYTZnspsds1jb0YBUCUw	4	2013-08-21 00:00:00	Always on the hunt for the perfect steakhouse I took up some Yelp recommendations and gave this place a try. We were a party of 6 and truth be told we were running on fumes from the prior evenings festivities (how strange...in vegas??) so this review is based on our less than average appetites. Although we did order a lot more than we could manage to eat.\n\nTheir most popular steak is probably the bone in rib-eye and it's a whopping 16 ounces (without bone)...quite hefty and although the steak was cooked to perfection it was definitely under seasoned. It also seemed mine had a bit more fat than usual which is as we know is where all the flavour is but it seemed perhaps a bit too much. All the sides were awesome and their meant to be shared family style... definitely try the garlic mushrooms!\n\nService was top notch...not in your face but always there making sure your wine is topped off and full of suggestions when you need.\n\nI've been to STK in Vegas and if you're looking for the more swank place you might want to hit that up but for a more authentic steakhouse experience I'd definitely recommend Delmonico...	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	pjo1fGaJGyWEgjMb9zsYFw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

FPsRFs-kfSNzATU0f7gcAQ	4	2013-12-15 00:00:00	I have eaten at this restaurant twice. The first meal was memorable and I never forgot it. As a result, I was so excited to go back last week. I had the truffle chips for an appetizer which were good but they didn't fit in with that kind of restaurant. My friend had a shrimp appetizer that was the favorite of the waiter's but we both found it very strange. It was supposed to be something creole and the shrimp was covered with an unattractive brown sauce. Odd.\n\nWe both had a filet mignon. I ordered mine medium rare. I couldn't finish the last 15% of it because it was rare. Disgusting. It was fine but not worth $50. It came with a  sauce that made it delicious though. Without the sauce it would have been a big disappointment.\n\nWe ordered a side of double baked potatoes. That was the best part of the meal.\n\nWe each ordered a dessert. I had the banana cream pie. It was gorgeous but it was all bananas (which I LOVE) but with little cream. It was fine. My friend had the creme brulee and it was delicious.\n\nService was very nice. Overall at $312 I won't be going back simply because it isn't worth the money.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Snz_ezPBW6OME6hLxX_dxg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I don't mind paying for good food but the steak is average, The place is nice but our table is right by the kitchen.

fQFMt6aAABIt9NtydYBtgg	5	2007-07-11 00:00:00	One of the most all-time memorable dining experiences I've ever had.  \n\nThough I am vegetarian now, my mouth *STILL* waters at the thought of the filet mignon I had at Delmonico's.  It was simply unrivaled by any other steak I've ever had and probably any other steak I ever will have.  I sincerely doubt that in my life I will ever -- EVER -- have a better steak.  It was perfectly cooked, and coated with the perfect amount of pepper and spices on all sides.  \n\nSecondly, but certainly not any less impressive, was the ceasar salad.  As somebody who orders ceasar salad everywhere she goes, I would venture to say that this was in the top three I've ever had -- I could probably even safely say it was the best.  Served with whole leaves, which I love, and the dressing was made at our table, right in front of our eyes.\n\nCannot be beat.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	YHrD0X9TFwk5-tcxnyj_bw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
fqYJ53gZY2cZDuexhl58Sw	2	2010-11-25 00:00:00	If you are going to pay $52 dollars for the most expensive meet cut, you expect high quality meat.  Instead I got a piece of meat that was 1/3 filled with fat, fat!! Come-on this is what you expect when you are eating at a college kid barbeque party.  While my gf order the shrimp pasta and that was unbelievably oily if you are going to cook with sausage one knows hit has natural oil so you dont need to fill up the frying pan with extra oil, someone needs to question the cooks they got.  Baked oyster was alright it was tasty, but buttery and oily as well, but still flavorful.\n  The only thing good about this place is the service.  The main waiter was very helpful when choosing a cocktail.  The servers where very friendly as well.\n  Bottom line: This place can cost over $150 person, depends what and quantity of order, skip the food at this place just come for cocktails.\n\nThis place got two stars for service and cocktails.

I also got the créme brûlée for desert. \nMy co-worker just got the NY Strip (well done), unfortunately it was not well done. However as soon as Michael saw that it was not cooked properly he immediately took it back and had it cooked completely. I would have not gotten a steak like that we'll-done but he's picky. When he got it back he said it was a very good steak, just wished there was more steak and less bone. \nI would definitely go back.

FUvT6LSoRbZfcHlDGXbGaQ	4	2011-02-18 00:00:00	Been here twice for lunch (once today and once during Restaurant Week) and once for dinner a long time ago....\n\nThis review is for today's Lunch experience.\n\nSo... this place exudes Power Lunch without the Noise ambiance...Soft lighting, quiet/hush talking, white table clothes, ultra professional service, a fabulous menu and high prices.  Everyone except me was in a business suit... but like I care.  \n\nMy g-friend ordered sort of off the menu... the options were on the menu but the way she wanted it prepared was not.  They didn't even bat an eye... they just asked a couple questions to make sure they "did it right".\n\nShe got grilled salmon and steamed / lightly sauteed spinach.... and it came out perfect!  It looked fabulous.\n\nI just ordered the cobb salad.  I know... I'm boring that way.  But it was a really good cobb salad... the bacon... OH!  The bacon! on my salad was The Best!  Freshly grilled skinny strips of bacon that were juicy and meaty.  I'll order it again just for the bacon "bits".  The avocado was fresh and creamy... the blue cheese crumbles were rich and blue-cheesy.  All in all, a very nice salad.  \n\nService was very professional and attentive without being annoying. They filled our iced tea and water without us even noticing.  It was awesome.\n\nFor lunch... it's pricey ... the two of us was $52 w/o tip....but if you want a really, really nice business lunch or a lunch that is NOT noisy, crowded or typical... Go Here.\n\nI'll be back because they have Lobster Sliders on the menu now... I gotta go back to try these.  :)	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	PV0VEhlmhc2BjzMZEbpWlg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
fV3nIvIpvlsY0CxmtJyV4g	3	2011-08-16 00:00:00	Beyond food coma...it's food paralysis!  The itis ain't got nothin' on this.\n\nI had my preconceptions of the food here but I put them away for a short time and figured I'll try anything once.  Dinner started with some bread with butter and munched on the truffle and parmesan potato chips.  They were very oily, warm, crunchy, savory, and tangy in flavor.  We did not make a dent in them.  The appetizer was soon followed by the lobster bisque and traditional New Orleans gumbo with chicken and andouille sausage.  The lobster bisque was really intense in flavor.  It had an almost bitter flavor but so rich like condensed sweet buttery lobster in sea water.\n\nThe protein that night was the bone-in ribeye which we split.  Perfectly cooked to medium, it had a nice crust on the outside and had a big glob of butter on top.  I immediately scraped the butter off and put it on the side but a lot of it had already melted onto the plate or penetrated the meat.  The meat was thick, tender, juicy, had perfect grill marks on the outside, and smelled floral due to the either rosemary or thyme sprigs.  Accompanying the main dish was the seared foie gras.  Yes, I had to try the duck (or goose) liver.  It was indeed buttery, silky, melt in your mouth tender and a good sized piece at that.  Like everything else here, it was seared in butter and had a salty, buttery crust to it.\n\nAs for the sides, we had sauteed garlic wild mushrooms and the creamed corn gratinee.  The mushrooms were delightful.  I loved forking up different varieties that I had no idea what they were.  They just tasted great.  The garlicky, buttery flavor and tender yet almost slippery texture makes this dish my favorite of the night.  The creamed corn also exhibited buttery flavor so much I think it was in a bath of butter and heavy cream.\n\nYou couldn't have all this great food without wine and they have an impressive wine menu indeed.  I went with that I know and got the syrah.  Toward the end of the meal it hit me.  The wall...of carbs, butter, salt, cholesterol, all in a sluggish soup coursing though my veins like molasses.  I feel my heart straining to pump the blood with heavy thumps and I feel the arteries of my wrist bumping against the table.  My body starts to get lethargic - I don't wanna move, no I can't move - as I gaze blankly over the huge leftovers of corn and butter.  This is beyond food coma, I need a blood transfusion I thought.  Need I be more dramatic?  My preconceptions were right.\n\nOn the bright side, the service is impeccable here and everyone seems to to take their job seriously and sincerely.  It is a bit of a formal atmosphere but you don't feel like you're in Las Vegas for the short time you're there.	1	3	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	nVd1RfGAJVxQj8MjuDYkAw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
fxqEGVZ4bbDdK5ubjJtuaA	5	2016-04-20 00:00:00	Had the pleasure of dining at this establishment recently and have to say the food and service was above par. My Fiance got the Japanese Wagyu Ribeye steak and said it was the most delectable steak he has had the privilege of tasting. I had the Filet Mignon and it was cooked perfectly. I would definitely come back for any special event or for a great steak.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4q7Mz4zl6uo6DokY6vMVOA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

FyVW3j2U_c9dX7P5XgAwlg	4	2010-07-07 00:00:00	Yum.Yum.Yum\n\nCame here 4th of July weekend to celebrate my gf bday.\nWe made reservations for a party of 8. However, we arrived an hour late but they still seated us immediately. Thumbs up.\n\nI really wasn't paying attention to what everyone else was ordering so I'll just list what we got..\n\nCrab Cakes\nRib Eye Steak \nShrimp Fettucinni with Sausages\nSteamed Broccoli ($10 for a small bowl.. I really wanted to go to the Frozen isle and buy one for $1.50) haha\nOrange Zest Cheesecake (My Fav)\n\nEverything came out to $180 but this included tax and gratuity.\nThe food was delicious, especially the steak. Not overcooked\nor too much seasoning. It was just right.\nFor the pasta they serve large portions of the shrimp. Not the baby shrimp you have to go digging for.\nAh ha and the crab cake was very good! I don't deal with that imitation crab. Yuck! It was not a huge portion but enough to make me happy.\nI heart the Cheesecake! It's a must! You can definately taste the Orange zest, which makes it original for your typical strawberry..etc..etc\n\nThe service was great. Why 4 stars instead of 5? Because they wouldn't allow us to sing Happy Birthday in the restaurant.\nGeeze are there any exceptions?\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this place.

f_sntqQDgOUHbTOpasyZPA	5	2010-10-12 00:00:00	This has definitely been the best Steak in Las Vegas that I have had yet. \n\nNot only were my date and I able to get a table last minute w/o a reservation - but our wait staff was very knowledgeable and friendly. I was given two wines to try based on my meal choice, and stuck with an Aussie Syrah that was to die for. \n\nWe were given no attitude when we told the server that we wanted to share the bone in ribeye($52) which was fab given our desire to try other menu items w/o emptying our pockets completely. \n\nStarted off with the Blue Cheese Apple Salad ($16) which had these grapes (that I originally thought were olives until I bit into them) I can only describe as being totally delicious. \n\nThen we picked the garlic sauteed mushrooms and asparagus for sides (all sides $9) The shrooms were wonderful, lots of flavor and definitely went well with the meat. The asparagus was cooked right, but I would say it lacked flavor, we had to sprinkle salt over it, and that is a downer for me at a nice restaurant. \n\nOur Bone in Rib Eye steak, which was split for us by the kitchen no questions asked, ... except for one "Who get's the bone?" "I Get the Bone!" I replied! \n\nOrdered along with a side of raw horse radish and their signature steak sauce ... The Rib Eye was cooked to perfection. I order my steak Med Rare (even though I like it bloody) because I've found in the past nicer steakhouses tend to cook on the rare side. True to form, it was cooked amazingly well. Very pink, and extremely tender. Every bite seemed to remind me of a fillet which is unusual for that cut of meat, it just melted in your mouth then, after my date made sure I wouldn't offend anyone by asking if they minded me chewing on the bone like a dog with table scraps ;) - I did just that \n\nI'd also like to mention that if you have a choice, I would ask for Todd to be your server, he was a delight to talk to, and payed us a lot of attention - which is more than I can say for the staff at Stack inside the Mirage :( \n\nOur entire bill was only $110 and we were both full and satisfied. I would go back to Delmonico's again in a heartbeat.	0	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	MSQJq_kGEob9tqkLfA9PEA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
G2R8Dl3ceQzTpggx5EgXyw	5	2009-04-20 00:00:00	I was in Las Vegas with my fiancé while he was attending a wireless convention for his company.  I asked a friend to recommend a good restaurant to go to while we were there.  From his short list of about 5, we chose Delmonico's.  Delmonico's is at the Venetian in the Palazzo with about 50 other shops & restaurants.  Attire was business casual.  The dining room was dimly lit and elegant.  They treat you with table side service, and very personal attention from no less than 3 attendants.\n\nThe wine list was impressive and started out with Kevin's picks (the sommelier).  I noticed the by the glass section only had about 5 different wines on it. Apparently this wasn't a by the glass kind of place!  Their wine list also boasted many 'cult' wines like Screaming Eagle and Harlan.  Although Twomey Merlot was on the list, we soon found that they had sold out already.  Our maitre d', Lamont, said he was a very big fan and recommended it frequently.  Kevin came by our table to meet us and said he wasn't aware they were out of the Merlot and that he would be ordering more that week.\n\nDelmonico's is a classic American steakhouse with Creole influences.  I couldn't decide between the crab cake, the ahi tuna & salmon tartare & the New Orleans BBQ shrimp so our waiter suggested the shrimp; said it was their signature starter and I was so glad he did.  It was amazing! I also had the filet. It was cooked perfectly, creole seasoned, medium rare (the color was consistently the same shade through the entire cut) and it melted like butter in your mouth. The service was exquisite.  There was a maitre d' & a waiter for every 3 tables and we were given a lot of attention.  For dessert, I had chocolate brioche bread pudding with Hawaiian vintage chocolate ice cream & fudge. When our server came back to check on us, I thought maybe I had a look of sheer ecstasy on my face, but he had said he knew how good  it was and wanted to make sure I was enjoying it as much as he does.  We surprised Lamont by telling him we were leaving him wine; he thanked us for our generosity.\n\nI am giving Delmonico's 5 stars, each of which I feel they are very worthy of.  Dining here was not cheap, or even close to being on budget, ($450 for 2 people) but it was fantastic.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	7-nTML-C8GhFwyVBB7118Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
G4LJgSvQZVFHk8KGv8pJ6Q	2	2012-02-04 00:00:00	The misleading reviews that others wrote about this place have almost made me lose all faith in Yelp.\n\nIn short, this place is NOT worth your money. No. No. No.  Let's recap why.\n\nThe service was hit or miss. When we got there a few minutes early for a reservation, I let them know we would wait for a good table. Instead, the hostess tried to sit us at a table next to a portable cooking station and this little room where the waiters get extra plates, forks, etc. Worst seat in the house. No joke. It was after 10 p.m. on a Friday. The place WAS packed, but there were a few better tables left. Why do us like this?\n\nSo we ask for a better table. Hostess walks us all the way back out of the dining room, looks at computer, walks us all the way back into dining room, this time to sit us near the open backdoor that patrons use to go to the bathroom and the waitstaff uses to hide in in between orders. It's January. So clearly this is a great idea. NOT.\n\nI was so angry I almost walked out right then. I could understand if it was 8 p.m. and those free, better tables were being saved for someone. But it was late. We were the last customers of the night. Give us the best, free table, you idiot!\n\nAnyhizzle, our waiter shows up and man is amazing. He reads us the whole menu, which usually I hate, but he was so charming, it was OK.  Loved him. Best part of the entire night.\n\nSo they start us with a complimentary  amuse-bouche, which was declicious. So second best part of the night. And that basically concludes are positives.\n\nThe bread was so boring I thought it was running for office. \n\nMy wine tasted as if the bottle had been opened the week before. When I complained ONLY because I was asked if I liked it, the amazing waiter brought me two other wines to try. Im telling you, best waiter ever. But the wines all tasted rancid. I didn't tell him this because I didn't want to be a jerk, so I just sipped happily cuz it is Vegas and the point is to drink, OK?\n\nWe started with the lobster bisque (I've tasted better lobster broth at Whole Foods and the lobster was hard) and a mushy tomato salad.\n\n Then we shared some crazy 32-ounce ribeye that came with a puff pastry and bone marrow. I love marrow, but this was gross. And the ribeye had no taste at all. No salt. No pepper. Just grease. Where's the BAM, Emeril? Also, the steak was so hard and not medium rare, as we ordered it. \n\nThe waiter recommended the potatoes gratin. Dude, I've made better gratin drunk. The potatoes were still hard and it tasted like pure garlic. I love garlic, but this was like Buffy the Vampire Slayer killing a villian garlic. \n\nSo we left. The check wasn't bad for Vegas. \n\nBut for a special night out? Not worth your time.\n\nI like StripSteak at Mandalay so much more. While it does have THE shittiest service, the steaks are like butter and the sides are to die for.	2	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	q7z_DtJOTqqK7lGYPu8mLA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
g5e5s-zhNt1i8d5UgSCKbg	1	2009-01-05 00:00:00	As a restaurant under Emeril Lagasse's name, I was expecting a consistent, quality meal.  Instead, I left very disapointed with the restaurant.  The only highlight was the signature BBQ shrimp appetizer.  The butternut squash raviolis with duck confit were unexplainably dry.  The shredded duck on top should be slightly dry or crispy, but the inside of the raviolis shouldn't be.  I don't know if I could even say the butternut squash was pasty.  So dry it was bordering on gritty.   \n\nThe truffle parmesan potato chips were cut ultra thin and so tasty, but were dripping with too much oil.  Instead of tasting light and airy, they felt weighed down by goopy oil drops that clung to each chip.  \n\nThen there's the steak.  We ordered one bone in ribeye and a standard ribeye.  Both cuts were juicy, marbled nicely and cooked to the right levels, except for one thing, the steak had no taste.  What creates the taste, seasoning and aging?  Well, whatever it was, it was only surface deep.  the outer portion of the steak was seasoned, but the meat in the middle really had no taste.  Even the butter scoop that topped the steak couldn't make a noticeable difference.    \n\nDon't get me wrong, the meat quality was good, but if I pay $50 for a steak, I expect flavor.  It felt like I was eating a $25 steak.   I almost wanted to ask them for bernaise sauce to get me through it.  Even though the wait staff was extremely helpful and attentive, it couldn't save this disappointing meal.   \n\nIn Vegas the only other steakhouse I've been to is N9ne at the Palms and I would recommend that over Delmonico's in a heartbeat.   I don't think I'll be going back.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	NOs3g2KLfNvuc9dDWy3syg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
G6m3KXyf1DSvsQbAj9ddWw	5	2015-09-15 00:00:00	I rarely write reviews, even though I rely on Yelp VERY heavily for my restaurant selections! It's usually just because nothing overwhelmed me, or I was too lazy to do so - I'm trying to be better about that! My husband and I went to Las Vegas last week for our first year anniversary to get a way for a few days. We always try and scout out new restaurants. This was definitely our favorite meal - hands down! The entire experience was great -- they brought out a small treat for us to start, then we both had amazing bourbon cocktails, and then dove into the delicious food. I got the Filet Mignon, but prepared Piedmontese style which is just seasoning, olive oil, roasted garlic, and rosemary - it was cooked perfectly (medium) and super tender and had great flavoring. It didn't need any sauce! My husband got the bone-in ribeye which they are known for I believe - I had a few bites and it was fantastic. The au gratin potatoes were also good and not overly heavy like some can be. Our wine was great as well, Stag's Leap. The BEST part of the experience though was our waiter Rene. He was so attentive, fun to talk to, and just wanted us to enjoy ourselves. He really made this experience special. I also have some dietary restrictions and I've never seen a restaurant be so attentive to them. It really put me at ease. Next time you're in Vegas, GO HERE. We'll be returning for New Year's this year and have already recommended it to some friends going out later this month!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	URv31w7eyRxB0tZlCRTMGw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I am a chef, and a succesful one I've ran restaurants and now I am a private chef, so I know food and service! I was with my girlfriend and another couple, from the start we were treated like we didn't belong there. They forgot to bring us our wine for like 20 minutes. The table beside us arrived after us and recieved their wine and food before us! They recieved excellent service, getting a amuse bouch, and all served at the same time! We were treated like dishwashers. I thought the food was ok, crabcake was decent but lacked simple seasoning salt and pepper! I thought they would at least make there own bread, but no. The ribeyes were charred black and had no seasoning, filet was ok but lacked seasoning. Gnocchi was great but a little salty. All in all food lacked seasoning, waiter was a asshole, all though the manager was cool I will never step foot in there again!!!!!!!!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	sCAiwg2TThO9cmt4rd49OA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

G9TSEZ8BfuSmcf5xy_qAfA	3	2013-12-02 00:00:00	Thanksgiving dinner with the family,  ok food but better can be had for the price.\n\nGoing in,  you expect good service ( check), nice atmosphere (check), and good food (mostly check).  At $14 for soups and $62 for a steak ( including $12 for peppercorn sauce).  You get it here.\n\nA couple of issues. Delmonico's is branded as a premier Steakhouse priced accordingly.  Nothing about my meal and / or my service deserved a premier rating.  My steak was ok at best.  The Peppercorn sauce lacked any sort of consistency and flavor.  My Wife's turkey was good... but that was expected given day.\n\nService was attentive and not overbearing. They accommodated our kids ( mostly stuck to their Kindles all evening... thank you Amazon!)    but were slow to react to most simple requests ( again, could be thanksgiving though we were there early).\n\nNet,  after spending a significant amount on a special dinner... nothing rings special!\n\nI expected more and it delivered a sub par experience for a Premier establishment.	5	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	KmubWHd-t2d3dxLZ13tBAA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

gCDDx8XAjDkQ6dubtiTleA	4	2012-01-31 00:00:00	I was over here for dinner the other night.  It took a while to get seated on a busy Saturday night, so we hung out at the lounge for a bit.  Once we were seated though, the service was pretty good, as well as the setting.  It was too loud as far as ambiance goes, but it wasn't too invasive.  \n\nWe grabbed the Stuffed Pork Trotter, which by itself could be an entree as opposed to the appetizer.  After we were "stuffed" with the pork trotter, we proceeded on to the main course.  I grabbed the boneless rib-eye, which was very intimidating.  I also shared some sides of spinach and mashed potatoes.  All of the main entree items were excellent, though I was too full to finish the rib-eye.\n\nThis place is probably one of the better steakhouses I've been to in a long while, despite the prices, which I was fine with paying.  Bring an empty stomach, but a full wallet.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	bdZLmvZg7ibzD0YbLfru6A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I was a little intimidated to eat at a place like this in Vegas but once we were seated everyone was super nice and didn't make us feel like we shouldn't be there.   \n\nThe menu has a bunch of different things on it but the star of the show (as told by my waitress) is the beef.   Husband and I knew we were both going to order steak before we even looked at the menu.   \n\nI ordered the ribeye with country smashed potatoes and husband got the filet mignon with creamed corn.   The side were served family style and were more than enough for two people.   The creamed corn was fantastic.  It had little bits of jalapeno in it for the extra BAM!  \n\nWe both ordered the lobster bisque to start.   Bisque was very delicious especially the lumps of lobster meat.   Did you know during the summer the bisque is dairy free?  \n\nThe steaks were just okay.  Asked for mine medium but it came out well done so I didn't find it that good.  Husband also asked for medium but basically got a rare steak.   \n\nOverall though the atmosphere was definitely upscale yet comfortable.  I want to compliment our waitress ...she was very friendly and fun.   Check was $164 dollars for two people.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	VN_n0Ddxny0J6Z0ehMsvUw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Finally the girl who was working the desk came over to take care of us. Service at the table was overkill. Too many different people trying to take care of us. Prices were high but that is expected so no big deal. Steaks were overcooked. That is poor for a steak house like this one. Sent them back. Manager did not even have the decensy to visit the table to attend to the problem.   First time there and with all the other great places to eat it will be the last.

The atmosphere was cool & hip but not fake or stuffy as sometimes happens in upscale establishments. It was romantic & relaxed. We felt right at home. The service was top notch....friendly & efficient as one would hope. Our servers were always a nod away & ready to tend to all of our needs. The meal was simply fantastic. Our salads were crisp & fresh. We ordered the Chateaubriand for two & were blown away at the quality of beef & flavor. A nice touch was the final searing & butterfly filleting table side. Coffee was good. Dessert was shared as no room was left after the meal. We enjoyed every savory bite.

gmoE6LWdibnUAg07ETG8Kg	5	2010-10-09 00:00:00	By FAR one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  I have eaten here many times for dinner and was able to have lunch as well.  Lunch was just as good and less expensive here as dinner.  What I love most about this place is the variety on the menu.  It is all typical steakhouse fare but with lots of choices and executed very well.  The typical blue cheese wedge is so decadent with large chunks of cheese and caramelized bacon, all other wedge salads will not do it for you in the future.  The lobster bisque is sweet and creamy and is a must have each time you go.  \n\nImportant hint: don't pass up dessert - a true quality restaurant will have a well rounded and exciting dessert menu.  Delmonico's never fails.  My favorite is anything chocolate/peanut butter or Baily's Irish cream inspired.  This restaurant always seems to have something like this on their menu.  Desserts are rich, gooey with a multitude of flavor combos.  Just what I like :)	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	MFaazTdvfJ_aa6coaWEu_A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
GmsLe3yas-GEG0E-EfOQrw	5	2015-09-11 00:00:00	This was an experience meal, and totally the right choice for my 30th birthday dinner.\n\nThe service was special. Lots of attention to detail, and I left feeling spoiled.\n\nI had the bone-in ribeye, and it was a serious steak. I cook a dry-aged steak from my local butcher pretty well. I'll satisfy any friend of mine with that, and I'm always happy with my work. This steak was just long beyond anything I could have made. Great quality meat, wonderful seasoning, perfect crust, cooked to perfect medium rare.\n\nTheir special Mai Tai is really, really good. If you want an appetizer, the heirloom tomato salad we had was amazing, drizzled with balsamic, oil, and mozzarella. Also really enjoyed the parmesan truffle oil chips that our friends ordered.\n\nExpensive, but one of the few meals I've had that can justify this kind of price.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	RHnXLe8Ia9uAbGmXFxiSsQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
GN7KnAaxJDrYgfJzgsvmkA	5	2016-07-13 00:00:00	We decided to give Delmonico's a try because we had received a special notification through American Express. I had been to Delmonico's in New Orleans many years ago and my Hubby and I frequented Emeril's in Orlando when we lived in Tampa. We were not disappointed!! I had requested a romantic booth and that's exactly where we were seated!! This experience was wonderful and memorable! For starters, our wait staff was Amazing! Kudos to Mark, Dan and Tyke. We started with the Carpaccio and Green Salad - both fresh and delicious! I ordered a special Ribeye that was not on the menu that Mark told me about. Divine! Hubby got the Japanese Waygu and said it was the most tender Ribeye he had ever eaten! For wine, we opted for a 1/2 bottle of a 2007 Chateauneuf-du-Pape that was perfect for our entrees. For dessert, we got the Chocolate Decadence Cake that was delicious! The only negative was the Pistachio Ice Cream had shells in the first bite. The Manager was summoned and the dessert was taken off the bill and he offered us the choice of another dessert which we declined. Overall, a wonderful dining experience and we would gladly return!!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	C6kw0Rny7jZAGjTj0MWA3Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

They have a great wine and cocktail list. To start, we got the seafood tower- lobster, oysters, shrimp, crab legs, tuna tartare YUM. All the seafood came on ice so I would recommend that you let it sit on your plate a couple minutes before eating. We also got the bone in rib eye which was cooked to perfection and huge! The chocolate cake and pistachio ice cream was a great way to end the meal. Definitely a pricey steakhouse but worth every dollar.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	cTUHaUFSULKwhXZV8JWf0w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
GPRcivjYT8rD-7XAEuEaUg	5	2014-08-19 00:00:00	I had the pleasure of dining at this restaurant while I was visiting Vegas with my fiance. We were staying at the Venetian and this location is conveniently located within the beautiful hotel so it was an easy choice for dinner. It is definitely nice not having to step outside of the AC when the average temperature outside is 115! \n\nI got the caesar salad to start and filet mignon for the main dish. Some of the side items we got were spinach, asparagus, wild mushrooms, and creamed corn gratinee. The main dishes do not come with sides so they are extra but the portions are large enough to share. \n\nI asked for my filet mignon to be medium rare and it was done perfectly. The steak was so tender and delicious! It was definitely one of the best steaks I have had. The sides complimented the meat nicely and everything single one of them were delicious. I wish I could comment on their deserts but we were both so full by the end of the meal that we decided to skip desert. This restaurant is a must if you are in Vegas!	0	0	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	GovTh3H_FdQzr32UJYzvPQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Sadly, I couldn't finish it, which is pretty extraordinary for me. We all ordered several sides (potato gratin, asparagus, baked potatoes, etc), each of which cost $9. \n\nAside from the monstrously huge (and tasty!) portions, I think the most memorable feature of Delmonico's was the ambiance and atmosphere. The staff is incredibly helpful, and ensure an enjoyable experience overall. \n\nDon't miss out!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	EkCPKyg1va4r8fZxlFk43Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The service has always been consistently great-call you by name, never a water glass left half full, and servers who know and understand the menu.  The food, well, that's what really keeps us going back.  Last visit, we had the Chateaubriand for 2-it was perfect.  The sides that came with were delicious and we had the beer/cheese dip with pretzel bread for a starter and it was heaven in a bowl.  I like the wine selection-our server paired our steak with an appropriate red-not too full, but not too sweet , either.  I also love that they've always sent out an amuse-bouche(a nice, little bite) from the chef before you order-it's the little things that add up!\nEmeril-you've done it right again!\nWe're going to actually try Carnevino, Batali's latest,  on our trip next month for something new, but I know we'll always visit Delmonico's!	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	dWByoEVy4FoY5nhxqUAACA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
GvBy6vL7aIrbdxmT6wbq-w	5	2011-09-19 00:00:00	probably the best steak ive had in my life yet.\n\nfirst and foremost it is a steakhouse.  so you can go ahead and eat whatever else is on the menu, but if you come to this spot without ever trying their steak youre a foolio.\nive been here several times now and each time my experience is stellar on the social and epicurious level.  good service, fantastic food, youre in vegas, what else do you want? (i guess winning jackpot at the casino would round it off nicely, but thats a whole 'nother story :)\n\nanyway, so in my opinion, dont even bother with the filet mignon, that cut is way over rated, which fancy pants rich people have turned into this "exclusive" non weight bearing tender cut of bovine that the social elite should be eating.  while, all of the tenderness story is true, the flavor is all in the bone in ribeye.  this place uses usda prime aged cut, which is the best you can get.  and get it bone in, the bones give off more flavor in the cooking process.  another sign of a good steak house is if its served with butter, which not every place does, but i personally think makes the meat taste 10x better.\n\none other thing i did like about this place is their dinner rolls served to everyone at the beginning of your dinner.  ya ya, dinner rolls, so what.  well, it was actually fresh here.  freshly made, warm, with a little bit of salt on it.  its like being at an awesome steakhouse that has a pan del sal bakery in it!  all in all, it's great food, great service, good location, being in between the palazzo and venetian, thats all you need.  just make sure you bring money, cause this place is on the pricey side, but have no fear, you will get your money's worth!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	WdI64x5m43rioUkeXwfKbQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I ordered medium rare, but it came out overcooked to a medium well.... I would have complained and asked for another one, had the steak not been so effin' delicious.\n\neven though it was over cooked, by my taste, it still ranked on my top steaks that i've eaten.  that's got to say something.  But I will say that in my groups of 10 friends, the majority of them got their steaks exactly how they ordered it.\n\nThe sides are good.  The fresh buns they serve are fantastic.  and they do supply some sauces with the steaks, but man... you just don't want to spoil the taste of these awesome steaks.\n\nThis place is pricey, but it's worth it.  they have a great wine selection.  50 page/chaptered wine book selected by their own somoliere.\n \nI'm going back.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	pMAwK2vBedwXrYNScwsl1g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The table-side Caesar salad preparation makes for good show and equally excellent taste.  It's not the quietest or the most interesting interior design, very basic and elegant if perhaps a bit crowded.  If you want a nicely cooked piece of quality meat only slightly on the spendy side this is a recommended option.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	J4uZ6QXpiUZ4hOGVVCX0wg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The seats are nice but some tables get way too close to each other.  \n\nThe calamari was very disappointing.  The warm spinach salad was really tasty.\n\nI had the BBQ samon - it was flavorful, tender, juicy and overpriced.\n\nIf I had to eat there again, I'd probably just get a steak of some sort.

I can happily chicken every day... buuut every now and then I get that naughty craving for some good ol' American red meat! :D\n\nSo ex-roomie and I went to Vegas to visit friends of hers and I told her we could do whatever they wanted & all I wanted in return was to visit one of the famous pricey Vegas steakhouses. All agreed and so we booked a reserv. for Delmonico. \n\nThe decor was simple, but elegant... kinda mod, imho. Looked very exclusive from the outside, so I felt all fancy. :D\n\nI have to give MAJOR props to the waiters(s), especially an awesome young gentleman who was a total sweetheart (I think his name was Andre..). Actually, I was shellshocked at the great service... most pricey restaurants are pretty snooty, but the peeps @ Delmonico were warm and super attentive.\n\nUnfortunately, there was major drama @ my table with a couple of the girls (snide remarks,  tears, running to the bathrooms), throughout which Andre (?) remained patient. I tuned all this out because................................\n\n..... I WAS HAVING MINI MOMENTS OVER MY AMAZING, TENDER, SUCCULENT AND DELICIOUS BONE-IN RIBEYE!!!  holy mother. The thing was huge and ex-roomie and I actually shared it (with Andre sweetly saying that it was not a problem) and it was STILL too much. Had my steak been anything but spectacular, I would have been mortified at the shenanigans. Instead, I swiped some artichoke spears (crisp, fresh and awesome) & truffle potato chips (a little greasy but OMG, so good)  from the other ladies and dug into the side we ordered, which was the potato au gratin (again, a little heavy but OHHH... so amazingly tasty... my favorite side dish!) \n\nCrazy delicious food, beautiful ambiance and wonderful service, and actually, with the magic of sharing, did not break the bank.

H8UtSo-Q5gw_tEO1q-L5xA	4	2012-10-09 00:00:00	This is not the Delmonicos restaurant of NY. This is an Emeril Lagasse steakhouse. There is no decoration to speak of. Just a large open room with many tables and many people chatting and laughing. We ordered the bone-in ribeye and it was prepared to perfection, but a tad bit too salty for my friend's taste. I loved mine, but you need to be a full-on caveman to eat the whole damn thing. We had the creamed spinach which was coarse and tough to chew and the au gratin potatoes were really good. The sommelier was great and recommended a very nice blend. We were so stuffed, we chose not to have dessert, but they looked quite good. This is a very nice, fancy steakhouse, but CUT still gets my vote for the best one around.	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	idiYLiIdov2thAWyHt2trw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

After dinner I was thinking about dessert and they suggested the banana cream pie.  Normally banana cream is not my favorite, so I was somewhat skeptical, but the server said that if I did not like it they would not charge me for it. so I gave it a try.  It was amazing, I would recommend it to anyone, but you can get it at any Emeril restaurant so dont go here just for that.

We never really had to wait long for anything because we had 3 waiters helping us.  They had really good bread to start off with and they made the best tasting whisky sour i've ever had from their bar.  I got the new york strip steak and it filled me up and tasted great.  it was a very quiet place too, most of the people there were older and drinking wine.  i'd go back if i ran into a lot of money, but i'm content with $12 steak.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	vtRc2ApxN_qYuPDWXAMvtQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The heirloom tomato salad was good which isn't saying much, but the steak was underwhelming.  The rack of lamb was probably the best dish we ordered, despite being a steakhouse. \n\nWe ordered two bone in rib eyes, a bone in New York strip, and a rack of lamb. The steaks were under seasoned and lacked that beefy flavor you'd expect from a steak.  We were told that the steaks were wet aged then dry aged, but couldn't taste any of that nuttiness that comes from dry aging. The meat was tender, but didn't have much else going for it. \n\nWe've eaten a handful of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants before, but this one really missed the mark.	3	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	OtKA03ALQQ1CBhtaJod_Jw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
HE_9xs3W1eM4RbcPv7X1lQ	4	2013-11-26 00:00:00	I was able to sample many menu items on my first and only visit to Delmonico's to date.   The things I loved were the Parmesan chip appetizer, the caesar salad, the soft shell crab and the BBQ shrimp app.  The Caesar salad was probably the best I've ever had.  The chips were thin cut and perfectly crispy.  The BBQ shrimps were cooked just right and the bbq sauce was mild and great for the shrimp.  The crab was excellent - perfectly cooked and had great flavor. I also tried the NY strip, it was cooked correctly and had a nice crust.  It was not the best steak I've ever had, but you can tell it was done with care and quality.  The appetizers were very good because each one had something that made it special...I would like to see that with the steaks as well.  I would say the service is what i was most disappointed in.  Not that it was bad, but it just wasn't what you expect from a place of this caliber (and price).	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	9SoO6g3AT7UHSaIRtwr_-g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The wait staff was friendly and very attentive to our needs.  I started with the gumbo.  At first it had a burnt taste, which seemed to go away as I ate more of the dish.  I had the chopped salad for lunch, which was huge and had lot of everything in it.

Hi4mdGwPdIMAaF4Gs9Qvvw	4	2011-04-23 00:00:00	Came here on vacation after a four hour drive from Los Angeles. We didn't change out of our road trip clothes but there was no judgement. The servers were always around and very friendly. The bread was amazing, never had one exactly like it before. We started with the truffle chips which were amazing! The chips aren't 100% evenly cooked/flavored but they were totally worth taking the leftovers to our hotel room. They didn't get all soggy the next day. For my meal we had the lobster sliders. When I took a bite it was something I didn't except at all but it was still delicious. LOTS of lobster meat as well. The bread is warm but the meat is cool and it blends well together instead of clashing. We were too full after that but would love to come back and try some more items.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	g6ZD4_Lg9N3DhYC2xXU22w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I should have left when I saw the stained carpet in the bar and had to clean off the seat at my table.  My cold lobster salad was rubbery,  My fried chicken and waffles were so sweet I couldn't eat them.

I have nothing negative to say whatsoever about the food. The restaurant design/ambiance is on point and so are the waiters/waitresses. I like their waiting room (piano, drinks, seats, TVs, and all). \n\nSeriously though, I could eat their steak for breakfast, lunch, dinner, AND dessert. That good.

hjLLRZpGCgIKmTzkHmiANQ	4	2015-03-07 00:00:00	Celebrated Labor Day weekend in Vegas and was looking for a good steakhouse. This place was high quality and great service. I ordered the salmon but substituted the potato and andouille sausage hash for mashed potatoes since I don't eat red meat or pork, and held off of the homemade Worcestershire sauce. The onion rings on the top were delicious, I could have eaten a plate of them! My boyfriend got the bone in rib eye and my friends ordered the Caesar salad for two (kinda pricey ~$34 - but good) and a steak and salmon. This will be one of my top restaurants I'll be going to when I go back to Vegas.	3	2	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	LDOL09p9foA9NOTvd88r_g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
hKQ0EZeeBUNWTchRd0dp9Q	5	2012-03-06 00:00:00	I don't think I could have found a more perfect place to celebrate my birthday! \n\nAfter an amazing experience in December, I was so pleased to hear we would be going back for my birthday! I decided that this time around I would try out something besides steak. I knew they had steak down pat, but if this were truly an Emeril place, I knew I had to check out the other menu selections. So this time around we enjoyed the artisanal cheeses to start and I had the shrimp with fettuccini with olive oil. My husband enjoyed a trio of filet mignon medallions. The pasta was perfectly cooked, not overly dressed in sauce with the shrimp cooked to exactly the right temperature.  My husband's filets were also perfectly done and the sauces that adorned the medalions were amazing. Truly amazing. We shared the potatoes au gratin and of course, these were just as heavenly as I remembered from our first visit. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the chocolate root beer float. The root beer was Abita, made in Louisiana. It was mild in flavor yet refreshingly delicious. I could swear that the chocolate ice cream was house made though I don't know that for a fact. It was sooooo refreshing and just the right way to top off our meal.\n\nI love Delmonico. It is by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I can't wait to go back. One day I hope to meet Emeril and hug him for making such wonderful food.	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	gVmUR8rqUFdbSeZbsg6z_w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I got this Linguine with pesto, chicken and pine nuts (yes I know, I ordered pasta at a steakhouse), but it was well worth it!  Emeril knows what he's doing no matter what the dish you order.  \n\nTheir tartar is absolutely fantastic as well. \n\nService is unlike nothing I've ever experienced.  Even though it's pricey and fancy, even if you can get here just once in your life, it's worth it!!!\n\nPS - Good beers and wines!	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	SwyAv7NwVmQIc0T6lMcQeQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
ho7ZJ6cCt9tCwhjQHUrjDw	5	2015-12-25 00:00:00	My experience at Delmonico was fabulous in every way. Service (especially with my large group) was superb. My last visit was my second time dining here. I must say, both of my visits have been an outstanding five-star dining extravaganza. \n\nThe restaurant was bustling for the Global Gaming Expo this past fall. We had reservations and were seated right away at a large table to accommodate our group of 9 guests. We were seated off the main dining room in a dimply lit secluded area that helped enhanced conversation and provided a more intimate dining experience. \n\nWe were promptly served our craft cocktails and wine as we browsed the menu for our dinner options. We all had a really tough time deciding on the dishes since everything looked and sounded incredible. Out waitress was on top of her game and cheerfully provided her recommendations to the group.  We ended up ordering a mix of entrees/ sides/ starters/ cocktails/ wine and sweets including a handful of Bone-In Rib-eyes (check out the photo- holy guacamole..) Bone-In NY Strips, Twice Baked Potatoes, Asparagus, Wild Mushrooms, Potato Au Gratin, Lobster Bisque, Wedge Salads with blue cheese crumbles, Banana Cream Pie, and coffee to top it off. \n\nMy guests and I were blown away by the food and service experience. Our favorite dish of the night was, you guessed it, the Bone-In Rib-eye steaks. They were seasoned perfectly with an awesome rub with hints of Cajun inspiration and topped with dab of butter. Yum. It is the best steak I've had to date. Simply divine! \n\nThe sides were large and intended to be shared and passed. We enjoyed the classic steak and potato combos and broke it up with some mixed green salads, asparagus and mushrooms. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted heavenly. We stuffed ourselves in a Thanksgiving fashion and had a wonderful and memorable evening. \n\nI will undoubtedly be returning for another amazing experience in the future! Kudos to the entire staff for making this an amazing dining experience!	6	1	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3Qv2rjPXC2eNKyV5lh3J_g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Three of us celebrating St Patrick's Day, March Madness, and 40th birthdays all rolled into one weekend, decided to enjoy a dinner at Delmonico's.  \n\nFrom the moment we checked in, fantastic service.  Our server, Michael, was gracious, professional, funny, and more than willing to tolerate and participate in our banter, but never in an obtrusive way.  The food was outstanding- the ribeye was perfectly cooked, and the creamed corn gratin was downright amazing. \n\nGreat wine selection, excellent service (have I mentioned the service), and a great pecan pie with some glasses of port.  This was a great dinner, and an experience I will appreciate for a long time, and worth every penny of the $200 per head that we paid.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	NxePIi2xlZxbqwdHyhkSBg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Feeling a little under see the weather the soup was a welcome relief for my scratchy throat.\n\nOur next course consisted of pan roasted Atlantic salmon for her and butternut squash ravioli in brown butter sauce for me. The raviolis were creamy and delicious.\n\nLast course we ordered the bourbon brioche bread pudding and emerils banana cream pie. Bread pudding was amazing and the cream pie wasn't half bad either. \n\nAll in all it was a very good lunch just wish I wouldn't have been sick.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	hmIfs8kGFRLhBtYRyM_VgQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
hUT4a7JtZrNtJJbNZLRF_g	3	2008-05-02 00:00:00	I have been taken here begrudgingly a few times now and have left with the same sensation of being overstuffed with average meat or poultry and starch.  The restaurant itself is not aesthetically appealing(drab lighting with white painted walls) and seating is not very private as the proximity of the tables are annoying.  I think the branding by Emeril has had a national appeal that people identify with and that's how his restaurants do so well but personally, I think all of his restaurant's food is mediocre at best with the exception of Commander's Palace in New Orleans.  Now don't get me totally wrong, the food isn't terrible as I still give this 3 stars but the whole experience here just won't knock your socks off.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	-uBmDm-WLzhue5KQUiol9g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
HVhh0LmA1N-xsyo3F2xZ9A	3	2008-05-19 00:00:00	I've been here twice so far and I'd have to say the first experience was the best even though they burned my steak.  Be aware that due to the way they cook their steaks you probably don't want anything over medium.  My GF hates raw meat so we ordered medium well and got a black looking steak.  I did complain and was told it was due to the way the prepare the steaks.  They did comp the steak which made things better.  I'm an appetizer man so I ordered several appetizers.  They were all excellent especially the Fois Gras dish.  \n\nWhat made my second experience less memorable?  MENU CHANGES!  Even though I knew how to order my steak perfectly now, they changed the appetizer menu on me.  They no longer offer ANY Fois Gras!!!  I asked the reason for this and was told they had people protesting about the item so they discontinued it.  I was so looking forward to it that it ruined my whole night.  I sub'd the Fois Gras with the Truffle Oil Home Made Potato chips and those are probably the best chips you'll ever have.  Desserts must not have been good because I don't even remember what I had.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Fwb7YdxaGO5LgaqPL132-w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
HVMjz7uF7cWwg7Ysdzli4A	4	2011-11-30 00:00:00	Why not 5 stars?  Because even though the food was amazing, I think it was a little too pricey for what they offer.  I was there for a work dinner, and I didn't have to pay for it.. but I sure feel sorry for our vendor that did.  It was a very expensive meal for the 5 of us. \n\nDon't get me wrong.  I had the BEST (sorry Tam o Shanter) steak I've ever put in my mouth here.  I got the bone OUT rib eye, covered with melty bleu cheese chunks.  I ate the whole thing by myself, which I thought was pretty impressive, because I've never even SEEN a piece of meat that big in my whole life.  Let alone that big on a plate to eat. But size aside, the steak knife almost literally fell through the steak once you started the cut.  I always thought the metaphor of red meat melting in your mouth was a little dramatic, but it really happened.  Repeatedly.  So delicious.\n\nWe also had the BBQ Shrimp appetizer, which wasn't what I expected BBQ Shrimp to be, but still really amazing.  It wasn't actually BBQ'd I don't think, but cooked and covered in BBQ sauce that was really tasty.  Not too smokey, not too tangy, not too sweet.  Just enough BAM!  OMG I'm sorry, I had to do it.\n\nI found the creamed spinach to be a little bland and lacking, which was disappointing, because the creamed spinach I had the day before at The Palm was fantastic. \n\nAlso had creme brulee for dessert, which is my favorite and really hard to do wrong.\n\nA great bottle of red wine as well.\n\nThe multiple servers were very friendly, very polite and very helpful and funny.  I found them all to be very accommodating and well trained.\n\nI am saving up to come back on my own the next time I go to Vegas. Yummy.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	KjHK1ie7vtboYdoTbLDFWA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
hVT-qDVRF0rIXsL-Fxa0pQ	3	2013-08-20 00:00:00	This review is actually an average of two visits. \n\nFirst visit was back in January of 2013. My friends and I decided to have dinner at delmonicos to spoil ourselves. We were in Vegas for the CES convention so the place was pretty crowded. We had to make reservations in advanced just to make sure we got a table.  \n\nSo what did we get? Bone-in Rib Eye. It was delicious. It was tender. It was juicy. It was pretty much the best steak I've had so far in my short life. The flavors were amazing and the seasoning was just right.. \n\nThen came dessert. I do believe my boyfriend and I had a cheesecake. It was so rich in flavor. While my friends, they had banana cream pies and one had bread pudding. Needless to say, we were very happy. The price was definitely worth it.\n\nService: N/A\nFood: A+++++ \n\nHowever, our second visit in August 2013, everything wasn't what we remembered it to be. The steaks were disgustingly different. They were dry. They were rough. I ordered a medium rare and it came out medium. It was NOT tender. It took a lot more effort to chew than it should for something that's $52. There were NO flavor in it and the seasoning was quite lacking.\n\nWhat the f*ck happened?!?!!!??!!! The steaks tasted like they were fresh steaks versus the dry aged ones that they advertised. \n\n\nTHEIR SERVICE IS FANTASTIC AND IMPECCABLE. \n\nWe had brought up the issue with one of the servers and the manager of the location, Doug, took care of us. My friend's steak, and so was mine, was done three times to see if we were happy with the results. My friend's steak was pretty much rare when she ordered medium rare so they tried to correct that for her. They took the steaks off the check and gave us complimentary desserts. \n\nEven though they tried to correct my steak and even though they had amazing service, I'm not sure if their quality control is at work anymore. The quality was a good 180. The piece of meat they gave me was comparable to a $20 steak from Outback or any other random cheap joint versus the $52 price tag. It could be a bad batch, it could be quality control, but I'm not sure if I'd return to the location.\n\nService: A+++++\nFood: F	3	1	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We walked over here on saturday night around 6 to start the night off right with a good steak dinner. This place came highly recommended from a friend. \n\nThe restaurant was overly amazing. It was clean and dimly light like most steak places. The waiters were knowledgeable and prompt with their service. I got kind of a pretentious vibe from our waiter which was a little off putting. But it didnt bother me too much.\n\nI ordered the Filet Mignon medium rare and it was cooked to perfection. I was very impressed. The steak was soft and flavorful and melted in my mouth. The side dishes were just ok. We ordered broccoli, creamed spinach, and fingerling potatoes. I wasnt impressed by the sides all that much. Not extremely flavorful but still decent.\n\nWe also ordered a $200 bottle of wine which was the most expensive wine i have drank before. I didnt know much about it, the winery was called Mastery and it was a red wine. My bro ordered it not me and it was really good! It was listed on the last page of the wine menu and was $40 a glass, but we ordered a bottle for the table. i wish i figured out what wine it was but it was really really good.\n\nThis is a good spot for a vegas dinner and a great way to start the night! i would definitely check out some other places before i come back here but i recommend it!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	mlnqX6MzQ0FxUbcVY782ww	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
hwmEJHtumKQOHqe85-H-iQ	3	2007-04-19 00:00:00	my bf and i were totally looking forward to dining at delmonico.  i like fancy dining, he likes meat, put it together and we usually go to a steakhouse.  however, i did look at the menu beforehand, and noticed there were no crab cakes.  i always have crab cakes before a filet!  so that's probably where the problem started.  i made a reservation a couple months in advance on open table, but even then i could only get a 5:30 rez.  i'm not sure of the entire layout, but it seemed like we were seated in a more private room, which was nice.  the areas we passed through were super loud (staff and wedding party of 20).  gorgeous giant leather seats.  we started off with the "creole boiled gulf shrimp cocktail with tomato horseradish sauce and homemade crackers".  there was definitely some BAM in the sauce.  very peppery and lingers.  the crackers were just as spicy, but why are crackers served anyway?  the shrimp itself didn't taste like it was prepared in any special way.  bf had a bone in strip.  i order one of the specials, kobe sirlon.  i'm sorry this had to be my first experience with kobe.  it was TERRIBLE.  pretty on the plate, thinly sliced, with sinewy strands running all through it.  i was mortified with all the chewing.  i partially blame myself.  i knew i should have stuck with my standard filet medium rare.  sigh.  and now i will probably never go back to delmonico.  the sides consisted of overly buttery country smashed potatoes and tiny fried bay scallops (tasted past its prime to me).  we also ordered an additional side of asparagus, also too buttery.  emeril's banana cream pie was good though.  intricately placed bananas seemed to float between layers of banana cheesecake.  the service is decent, but a bit impersonal.  we made a huge stain on the white tablecloth with a piece of dropped meat, and i expected the server to make a joke at least.  total damage, including tip, no drinks, was $195.	2	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	vEoPutr3TvZDSDboQ0xWIA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I had called other steakhouses, but since we had a large party, I was told we had to order from a set menu.  Us clods just wanted a delicious slab of steak, some wine and we'd be happy and Delmonico was there to provide.  The only shortcoming was the wait to take our orders, but once our waiter came, it was all good.  The wait staff had a great sense of humor which added to the night's festivities (hell they were serving a bunch of goofballs).  Of course, the best part was the steak.  Most of us at the table had the bone in ribeye steak.  Let me first say I didn't eat much of anything that day in anticipation of this dinner and we didn't have any appetizers or salads and I STILL couldn't finish off that piece of meat!  My steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and was wonderfully seasoned.  Thanks to Delmonico for tolerating the circus sideshow and cooking up some awesome meat..  and sorry to housekeeping that we ordered 4 orders of asparagus!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	trsr1OL-Cn3ZYjTNYIxfKQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

This ties with the best service I've ever had and is second to none from my experience. \n\nWe don't have a lot of experience with wines and there was no hint of pretense or haughtiness from the staff and we felt very welcome and enjoyed the experience. The dress code was casual with no jacket and tie required.\n\nThey have a huge selection of cocktails and wines and we received friendly and helpful assistance in finding a wine to our liking and were immediately offered an alternative after the first selection didn't exactly meet my wife's liking. \n\nThe bone-in ribeye was perfect and I was very pleased with the Cajun seasoning used there (Emeril's). My wife had the rack of lamb and was very pleased with it. The pieces were very meaty. \n\nThe twice baked potato is HUGE and would be easy to share. The vegetable selections are also served with plenty to share so ordering one entrée for each person in a couple with a single potato and single vegetable would work sell. \n\nI can also recommend the crème Brule which had fresh fruit on top and was a very nice dessert to share.	0	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Euhl0ywRm-kiJ3nGl06L0g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

He decided to take me for Mother's Day this year. It actually wasn't as great as I expected.  I heard so many great things about this place but I would give it an "OK."  It's good, but we have been to better steak houses. I ordered the bone in ribeye. It was cooked perfectly though. Kudos to the chef. The best part was dessert!  The pecan pie was delish!! I probably wouldn't come back here again, though. There's other places that I enjoy much more for the same price.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3o8c_R-Kv5UOoXXuMEOZAw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

HztzwhTh8-jbRsOEeXnGjA	5	2009-04-03 00:00:00	we got here at 730pm with reservations at 8pm, so we waited for a little bit in their "lounge." here, i asked for water, and the waitress gracefully brought me a glass, even though we were probably expected to order an alcoholic beverage. we waited about 15 minutes in their lounge, and then a waitress took us to our seats. the restaurant was surprisingly large, and we were seated in the middle of the back room. i was surprised at the decor, it was rather.. plain.  plain white walls with dim lighting.. it kind of felt like we were just being seated in a large room. after sitting, the waiter explained to us about the menu, and then left a very large book of alcoholic beverages for us to look over as well.  the menu wasnt too large, which was good for indecisive people like us. :)\n\nto start, we ordered a Lobster Bisque ($12.50) to share, esp after reading the rave reviews about it here. like i said, not hyped. it was sensational. it was so smooth, creamy, and rich, mMm.. i'm drooling right now just thinking about it. for our entrees, i ordered the Colorado Rack of Lamb ($48) with a side of Roasted Fingerling Potatoes ($9), and the friend ordered one of their specials of the night--Blue Cheese covered Bone-in Filet with Bacon ($55) with a side of Sautéed Garlic Mushrooms ($9). i'll start with the sides. the potatoes were okay.. nothing too spectacular.. a little bit on the salty side.. but it was a good side if you need veggies (or veggie-related) along with your meat. the mushrooms were good. tasty, cooked nicely, and i dont even like mushrooms! i ordered the lamb cooked to medium, and it was still slightly too red for me, but it was good nonetheless. a little bit on the fatty side, but it was tasty, and came with a popover.. which is this egg-battered bread thing that went really well with the lamb sauce. i actually had a bite of the friend's steak before i dug into my lamb, and boy.. that steak was FABULOUS! the blue cheese, bacon, steak, and tangy sauce that came with it made the steak utterly orgasmic. perfect blend of flavors. the meat practically melts in your mouth. friend got the steak in medium rare, but it seemed slightly more cooked than it should've been. it definitely didnt take away the tenderness though, this was the best steak i've had in my life (and i only took a couple of bites from it). this was one of the specials though, so it probably wont always be available. just writing about it right now is making my stomach grumble. i was craving to see what their desserts would taste like. we decided to go with the Chocolate Bread Pudding ($10). it was really chocolate-y, but for chocolate-lovers like me, it was perfect. it was the cherry on top of an already great meal.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ZNgHbkCzBgH1qyLxtAfu3A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Hzxst8WjBZuhwoV5GjS1tQ	5	2016-09-21 00:00:00	My colleagues and I were in Vegas for one of our fun "day trips" from Silicon Valley and decided to stop by Delmonico Steakhouse, which is located at The Venetian. We were dressed very casually (it was, after all, a day trip) and worried we might be treated differently at an elegant restaurant like Delmonico Steakhouse. We were wrong. From the moment we walked in, we were treated with the best service possible. \n\nThe wine list is extensive, as is the dinner menu, which offered great courses for our varying palates. I enjoyed a filet with "Oscar" and it was absolutely fantastic! My colleagues were all very impressed as well. \n\nWe were also quite impressed by the staff, who were willing to "rush" things for our table, as two colleagues had an earlier flight back home. Excellent food, service, and ambiance will ensure I come back here next time I'm in town.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A-JQ0txtMa5E2KQjMXoQAA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Even Rip Van Winkle bourbon is available for the drinking.  \n\nTop notch steak house with incredible care taken in the preparation and display of the dishes.  The chateaubriand is outstanding and the sides were all very amazing including the creamed corn and perfectly cooked asparagus.  Don't forget to try the banana cream pie (it's quite large so you may want to split it)!\n\nService was also top notch.  A team of servers was always available to ensure you could ask questions and ensure you were satisfied with your meal.  \n\nThis place is good for just about any occasion.  They also do tastings if arranged ahead of time of off-menu items such as stuffed quail or other dishes. Highly recommended....you won't be disappointed.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	uOqsIJM30bkN3E0mj0BTIw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I1QgsrXl1TBp8doA2kjH6Q	5	2010-02-19 00:00:00	in a nutshell:\n\n-best service I've ever received in a restaurant.  They treat you like you are the owner, totally personal and attentive without ever being intrusive.  The wait team is on the ball with every facet of service\n\n-Food was fantastic of course.  Got the bone-in filet (10oz) which was cooked perfectly, the missus got the filet medallions, which was a bit misleading as these were small steaks, not "medallions"!! Lot of food.  The side dishes are quite large, suitable for 3 or 4, so a party of 2 will have more than enough ordering just 1 side dish.  \n\n-The room is very nice. Uber minimal, nothing on the walls, just nicely sculptured archways and ceilings.  Very nice environment for a phenomenal meal.   The prices are high, esp considering side dishes are all a la carte, but nothing astronomical.  Figure around $100/person for a starter, entree, non-alcoholic drink, dessert, tax and 20% tip.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	c9m7rg-JO-GT2CXifcaZ4A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
I1SZsm5u53gnjDWL01mC_A	4	2007-06-08 00:00:00	I really wasn't aware that this restaurant is Emeril's place until I looked it up on msn.com.  In any case, I was dying to taste ribeye in every restaurant and since this place was highly touted as being one of the best in Vegas, I had to go here.\n\nSo surprise, surprise, I ordered the rib-eye.  My wife ordered the filet mignon.  My impression before we received our dishes was that this was an upscale place so we were expecting meats on the level of Ruth's Chris Steakhouse.  I was slightly disappointed in that their rib-eye, although good, I felt was only slightly better than a Black Angus steak.  I've had a much better tasting rib-eye from Smitty's in Pasadena.  The filet was nice and tender so that was the bright spot during our dinner date.  We also ordered a couple of glasses of cab and so it complemented our steaks very well.\n\nThe service was, as you would come to expect, excellent.  If it wasn't for the rib-eye, which was lacking some flavor, I would've given it a 5-star rating.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	pSoe4XBftnJiTgG1fPw52g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The food and service were both certainly good, but....I don't know....something was lacking.  It may have been the atmosphere.  Everything seemed very bland and sort of old - for instance, the leather dining chairs all had cracks and chips in them, which isn't what I expect from a place of this caliber.  I guess it just wasn't a very special experience.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	liDy_VOjCGwHeN1t5HT6bg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I40LJKHz9HZRR145_qmxBw	3	2008-09-28 00:00:00	It was a good restaurant but I wouldn't tell a friend "you have to try this place!" \n\nI didn't want to order a whole steak for myself because I was on a diet at the time so I decided to share one with my sister. This was a bad decision. If I have never been able to get along with her, what made me think we can share a steak. This was apparent after she ordered it "medium well" and I shot her a look and remark of "I don't want mine medium well, I want it medium rare" This minor conflict turned uncomfortable for the rest of my family as her and I debated over how our steak should be cooked. (My theory - anything over medium kills the good juicy flavor) All the while the waitress was standing there, listening to us go back and forth about the steak. I don't remember how it ended up being cooked, but I do remember the steak coming out cut in half. Thanks waitress. \n\nThe food was good, I think everyone was pretty content with what they ordered. I don't think any of us thought it was the greatest meal ever, but it worked and we were satisfied. Service was nice, patient, and attentive.	0	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	PN9BUVPlH77KRQmoHqFu4Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
I47UgNebLhe62w5og3MvOQ	4	2011-01-27 00:00:00	The place? Comfortable yet elegant.\nThe service? Spot on.\nThe food? Really good, but...\n\nSomething was lacking. I had been wanting to try one of Emeril Lagasse's restaurants for awhile and was really excited to dine at Delmonico, but the food didn't blow me away like I had expected it to. Their gumbo was good, but lacked a bit of salt. Their pork chops were good, but could have been a little more tender. My friend noted that the texture of the steak was a bit off. Their desserts were good, but the chocolate cake was kind of dry. Everything was "good", but nothing was great. Wait...I take that back - their dinner rolls were delicious! \n\nAlthough I really enjoyed my Delmonico experience overall, I don't think I'll be returning anytime soon. (I have yet to find a steakhouse that I like better than Mastro's!)	7	3	5	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	E0x8ew2yWRHcVdEMPI7kkg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
i4AJLXtgmmyeGiZGNlBTBg	5	2013-05-25 00:00:00	The service was great! When our server came, she apologized saying that she thought someone had already taken our order. We didn't even notice, and it didn't feel like we waited long. It could be due to the multiple servers making sure we got our drinks and bread. \n\nWe shared the bone-in ribeye (18 ounce) and the butternut squash ravioli and was not disappointed. My partner's only regret is not ordering a ribeye all to himself. Additionally, when we split it, we only had one choice of how we wanted it cooked. I like rare, and my partner likes medium rare. It came out perfect for both of us. \n\nThe rib-eye was deliciously slightly crispy on the edges with the perfect amount of fat to make it melt-in-your mouth. The flavor was delicious and makes me want more thinking back to it. \n\nThe butternut squash ravioli was very delicious as well and a wonderful surprise. We did not know what to expect of it. My partner loved it. He loved the sweet flavor inside the ravioli. I am personally not a huge fan of the sweet potato genre, and it did taste a great deal like sweet potato with butternut squash texture within a delicious ravioli. It deserves a 10/10, it's just not my preference.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Mag-7VKwjdE7gWBeR_Evrw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The service is impeccable, waiters remove plates the second you are finished and they are very approachable. The most recent trip I had the braised pork appetizer w/cranberry, creole mustard and basil which was delicious. The entree consisted of the charbroiled bone-in filet mignon with roasted root vegetables, fingerling potatoes and jumbo onion rings. Very fun. Thanks to Hector, my server, everything arrived on time and well prepared.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	kmuECstLly_ZlYxQAfo4jQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
I6MeNWbPTSjqXSvppTNNIQ	4	2013-01-16 00:00:00	Having been to most of the steak places in Vegas I was excited to try something new so I chose Delmonico's.\n\nHad a reservation but arrived early and they go us in fairly quickly. They aren't overly friendly, the barely look at you and they speed you to your table, but that's where I wanted to be anyway. Service in every other way was impeccable. I was pretty impressed with the waitstaff from the start. They were amazing.\n\nSat down and only had water between me and the business associate I was with. He declined an appetizer, but I chose to have the half dozen oysters on the half shell. They were tiny, but delicious. I definitely would recommend these if you enjoy nice, mildly salty and briny oysters. They had a lot of flavor for the size.\n\nWe both ordered steak; I had the bone-in ribeye and he the filet mignon. I also ordered the foie gras to top my steak.\n\nMy steak was a nice size and it was cooked medium rare with the outside being a little tough and very seared on the outside making it tasted burned almost. I ate around that and was pleased. It isn't the best steak I've ever had, but the prices were reasonable so it hurt less. \n\nThe foie gras was tasteless and a waste of money. I like mine to be buttery and melt in my mouth. Not happening here, save your money. There are a lot better places to get it.\n\nMy associate had the filet and I tasted it; it was tender and moist. It was cooked perfectly, but the outside was pepper coated and it tasted bitter. Not a fan of that.\n\nFor dessert we split the banana cream pie and it was the best part of the whole night. Highly recommend! It tasted like something my mom would make and I loved it! It was big and we couldn't finish it. I bet it would have tasted awesome right out of the fridge the next day, but alas I left it there. \n\nAll in all it's an okay restaurant. I probably won't go back because there are a lot better steak houses, but I enjoyed it for what it was.	5	0	4	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	jjogE_kPPMjxKvDEFlct6w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I8F90p209Z9Uo4P6jCwPZw	5	2011-12-29 00:00:00	Ahhh. Delmonico. I always make a point to visit this restaurant when I am in Nevada, for this is my favorite steakhouse. The ambience is quite dim, and the overall atmosphere simple and elegant.\n\nWe started out with the truffle and parmesan chips as well as the pork trotter. The chips= simply AMAZING. The chip was light and airy, yet when you bite into it, you get the perfect combination of truffle oil and crisp potato. The pork trotter was also good, but I believe that it was better the last time I came.\n\nAs for the steak, I ordered their signature bone-in ribeye with a side of spinach. The steak came with butter on top, which I found different because not many other steakhouses included that. The steak was delicious; and i was able to finish it without problem.\n\nHowever, I was too full for dessert, and did not have the opportunity to see the desert menu. Last time when I was here, I remember the peach or apple (some fruit) tart with ice cream was the best.	3	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	RkfQX8dSJNzkAAItX326Og	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
i9iEBI2uiWdyQq9UEf4sYQ	1	2016-07-28 00:00:00	My husband and I ate at Delmonico on our recent trip to Las Vegas. He was there for a job interview and this was our one night out together. The food was good. I got the mixed greens salad and he got the wilted spinach salad. Both salads were very good, especially the wilted spinach. We each got the NY Strip, medium rare. It was not overcooked, which was nice. I thought the rub and char on the steak was good but my husband did not like it at all. We got the creamed corn and mashed potatoes for sides. Creamed corn was very good but the potatoes were a little bland. \n\nAs we were leaving we noticed the signs for a 3 course prix fixe menu. This sign was outside the restaurant and we both remembered seeing it as we entered, but after waiting inside, being seated, and then getting menus we did not remember this. We asked if that menu was currently being offered, and it was. There was a separate insert inside the menu, however, neither of our menus had it. We asked to speak to a manager and he apologized and said it must have been misplaced, or the customers before us didn't insert them back into the menus. Yes, the manager stated that it is the customers' responsibility to make sure their menus are current. It was quite suspicious that NEITHER of our menus had this insert. This makes us suspect a deliberate move by our very attentive waiter. The bigger bill we paid meant a bigger tip for him. We don't care about the money; we feel like this restaurant took advantage of us and the manager did absolutely nothing to try to rectify the situation except make inappropriate excuses.\n\nIf you eat here, you MUST be aware of any special offering if you want to take advantage of it or you won't be told about it. You must also be absolutely certain to replace any menu inserts for the next customer - that is NOT the responsibility of Delmonico Steakhouse, according to their manager. \n\nWe were very, very disappointed and angered by this extremely poor customer service. Being deliberately duped by the waiter was one thing, but to have the manager defend it and make excuses was simply appalling.	0	3	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	JwI8UxlAjUr9a6WplPtRKQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Took great care of us and explain the specials thoroughly.  Also helped gave us the idea that the last person at the table should take care of the tab. =)\n\nTheir whole menu sounds tasty....good selection of meats and a lot of sides/appetizers to accommodate your needs.\n\nI ordered the Truffle Oil & Parmesan Potato Chips for my appetizer.\nOMG....it tasted so good.  Best chips I've ever had!!!  It's crunchy...tasty...and best of all...it's cheesy!\n\nFor my entree....I stucked with their Bone-in Rib Eye with a side of corn. I always like my steak medium rare and they cooked it to perfection.  Steak was super tender and juicy.  Dash some horse-radish on the side and I'm happy.\n\nMy buddy Eugene ordered their "Tomahawk" which is basically a 32 oz. Ribeye with a big ass rib to boot.  He topped it off....of course....with some foie gras.  \n\nMost of the table ordered their own rib eye steak....and ordered a lot of different sides to mix it up.  I'll say my favorite was the Wild Mushrooms and the Grits.\n\nOverall, pretty good...will definitely come back to give this place a second spin.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AIaegsReyPT1j66wRyQHCQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The food was good, not great and we had a minor slip up -- which at a fancy restaurant, such as this...there should not be slip ups....here's what happened:\n\nMy sister was chewing her steak and then started crunching on somehting hard -- it was the plastic tab they put in steaks to mark 'how to cook it.' So you think 'oops, they just forgot to take it out, right?' Well, when you think about dining at such a nice place, a steakhouse at that, with famous chefs and executive chefs and the sort....should they even need to have to use the little plastic things to tell when or how a steak should be cooked? \n\nSince it was my mother's birthday they brought her out a free scoop of sorbet. ....yes it could have been nothing, but a scoop of sorbet at a fancy restaurant??? - a baked slice of cake or something made by a pastry chef would have been a little more appropriate and suiting. \n\nThe atmosphere too was very cold and there was no warmth or decor to the place. \n\nThe service was, however, excellent! Very professional and nice. They did take care of the 'slip up,' but I must say, "with all the places in Vegas, I will not be dining there again."	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3cQrlGeEiZVOkFc30a5FgQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I guess it didn't have real pomegranate juice.\n- (4) complementary amuse bouche - crostini, cheese, balsamic vinaigrette: a pleasant surprise treat, a nice 2-bite start.\n- (5) truffle & parmesan potato chips:  crispy, oily, & flaky cheesy goodness!  plenty to share.\n- (4.5) rib eye (no bone):  cooked perfectly medium rare, lots of flavor, no need for any jus.  however, I couldn't get my mind out of the other 2 steaks I tasted...the bone-in NY strip & the bone-in filet...wow!  bone-in is definitely the way to go...\n- (3) creamed spinach, potato gratin, & grilled asparagus:  our side choices were pretty average, but loved how the portions are sized for sharing.\n- (5) EXCELLENT SERVICE!  everything was a presentation...from the mention of specials, answers to questions, they announced the highlighted ingredients for every plate and cocktail they put down.  magnificent!\n\nI wish I knew the portions were big enough to share.

ifK3HeGQOOW-zJagmQttGw	3	2013-03-09 00:00:00	I'd probably give Delmonico four stars, except that my expectations were set higher than they probably should have been. In all honesty, The Delmonico did not deliver anything notably better, more worthy of celebrity, than the average high end steak house in Nashville - including Stoney River, Ruth's, or local favorites like Sperry's. I guess I thought that for all the critique Emeril gives Top Chef stars, his restaurant would blow me away.\n\nThe homemade truffle chips were good, and somewhat unique, but perhaps a little over cooked, leaving a numb of chips hard.\n\nOur steaks were indeed prepared excellently, and a quality cut of meat. I had the filet, which was an ample serving and cooked to a perfect medium rare.\n\nBut the twice baked potatoes were a big disappointment. The shells seems to be way overcooked, to the point or requiring a steak knife to cut through them. The flavor was bland, even with cheddar and bacon. A little salt and pepper certainly helped.\n\nWe did enjoy the creamed spinach, even including my colleague who usually doesn't like green things.\n\nThe bread pudding was definitely the way to go on dessert. We also had a slice of banana cream pie, but the star was the bread pudding, which was not ruined with raisins. It was rich, smooth, creamy and delicious.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	CHYvZ-r1_bSMfBCswelaBw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

IKqscSMGEw1v4omzytfKeA	4	2010-09-09 00:00:00	I went here for my friend's bachelor party's dinner.  I am not a steak person but after reading all the reviews here about the bone in rib eye and then hearing the waiter's description I was in for one.  I ordered it Medium Well.  When it came to the table I was expecting it to be tough, chewy, small, etc... When it arrived at the table it was a pretty big slab of meat and  when I cut into it and had my first slice it was totally opposite of what I was expecting.  It was soft, flavorful, and melted in your mouth.  I should have expected that instead since it was priced $52.  Best damn cooked to order piece of steak I have ever had to this day =)	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	lnZAC2F0Qx_17YQqvjxcEQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
ilO_h09Zj2Uah5bv4cYFgA	5	2009-04-17 00:00:00	I took a group of eight to Delmonico for business. My party included a number of foodies, including a couple that prided themselves on having been to the best steakhouses around. Most people had steak and Delmonico fared extremely well, with one person saying it was one of the two best steakhouses he had ever been to. We enjoyed the appetizers -- Emeril sure knows his barbequed shrimp! Sides were excellent, including asparagus, creamed corn, and au gratin potatoes. I had the salmon, which was extremely flavorful and perfectly prepared (despite being farm raised). The wine list is extensive and impressive, although finding a reasonably priced bottle was a challenge. Service was truly exceptional.\n\nWe had appetizers to share for the whole table, top-end entrees, and two desserts.  Also quite a few bottles of wine (albeit on the lower end of the price list) and several after dinner drinks.  With tax and tip the meal was a bit over $150/person.  Clearly not a budget place, but for a top Las Vegas restaurant and for the amount we ordered I thought this very reasonable.  You could easily blow the budget on that wine list though!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	5D6qZHR1a2wa3JCQ8xf79A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

It was not minimalist, it was just blah. Anyways, onto the food.\n\nThe steak was good, but not as good as others Ive had. The stand out was the BBQ shrimp appetizer and the lobster bisque. Those 2 made the meal. The BBQ shrimp was in a gumbo like sauce, but it was so good. And then I dipped the bread into the sauce too. The lobster bisque was perfect.  IT came out in a sauce pan and they poured it into my bowl.\n\nService was great, I think I had like 3 servers.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	cjNa0LO5D--5D3h5YSMHRg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

irMaswI6GZmYt9AVVrqXVw	1	2013-03-17 00:00:00	We were sat at 9:15. Dinner arrived at 10:45...  Those of us not drinking wine were not offered anything other than water. Once dinner arrived a couple of the steaks were placed in front of the wrong patrons. Instead of just correcting the issues, the server/manager restated what I ordered (the bone in NY strip). The steak in front of me was very clearly a filet. Our wine glasses were not cleared until our dinner plates were...\nThe steaks were decent. Not amazing, but adequate...  \nRestroom was dirty, toilet seat damaged, no hand towels. \nA relatively pitiful attempt at a fine dining experience.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	fLIfNVO7FWIUQ3j-m3PHwg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
IsFiM2sCdnkYnQN1KFU_Xw	5	2007-03-25 00:00:00	So, after several years of not eating at an restaurant of Mr. Lagasse, I finally made it to Delmonico's.  Why might you ask?  Well for one reason - the bone in aged rib-eye steak.\n\nThis was the third Emeril restaurant that I've eaten at.  I used to live in New Orleans and ate at his first restaurant, Emeril's, and his casual outpost, NOLA, several times.  The food was good at times, not so great at other times, but the one thing that was constant was the excellent service.  \n\nDelmonico's continues that tradition.  The service is excellent.  At times, it's a little too friendly, but attentive and not overbearing.  Food came out at a very good pace, allowing for long conversations without interruption.  And the decor is so understated and clean.  It really is a nice change from all of the typical Vegas restaurants with loud lighting and faux-glam decor.\n\nBecause my girlfriend was so eager to try Emeril's food (she's a big fan), we started off with some classics - barbecued shrimp (New Orleans style) and shrimp cocktail with remoulade sauce.  The lunch menu usually has shrimp remoulade over fried green tomatoes.  However, it wasn't on the menu and I really wanted my girlfriend to try it.  The waiter was nice enough to accommodate my request, learned they had some prepared and served it with the shrimp cocktail.  To drink, she ordered a glass of Loosen Bros.  "Dr. L Estate" Riesling and I ordered a glass of Laurent Perrier NV Champagne. \n\nThe Riesling was recommended by the Asst. Sommelier.  The waiter initially recommended an Australian white blend.  But to me, it didn't seem like the best match with the barbecued shrimp because it lacked the acidity to cut the richness of the dish.  When I commented to the Sommelier that I thought the Australian white had Viognier in it, he said it definitely did.  As we talked more, he said the Riesling was a "perfect match" for the barbecued shrimp.  You know what?  It was.  My girlfriend wolfed down half of the barbecued shrimp, taking a sip of the Riesling with each bite.  She even raved - it was a perfect match.  And she also loved the remoulade.  The barbecued shrimp were cooked well, I noticed one of the shrimp I had was a little tough, but the remaining shrimp were plump and juicy.  The shrimp cocktail was great.  Cold, large shrimp, moist, juicy and firm.  They were perfect with the remoulade sauce.\n\nFrom there, we split the bone-in rib eye which was cooked ABSOFRIGGINLUTELY PERFECTLY MED-RARE TO MED.  It wasn't charred, but had that crunch of a good high-temp seared steak.  The twice baked potato with bacon and cheese was sinfully great.  The asparagus was sauteed with garlic and shallots, cooked perfectly through with still a slight crunch.  We shared a half bottle of 2003 Pine Ridge Crimson Creek Merlot which was a good match for the steak.  It had good balance, acidity, but enough soft fruit to please my girlfriend, who doesn't like tannic wines.\n\nDessert was banana cream pie for her, pecan pie for me.  Both were excellent.  The banana cream pie wasn't as sweet as expected, which made it even more easy to eat.  She ordered an espresso martini made with espresso (not the flavored vodka), I ordered a glass of 2003 Carmes de Rieussec Sauternes and finished with a cup of chicory coffee to finish.\n\nWas it inexpensive? Of course not.  It was quite expensive.  But for the excellent quality of food (far, far, far better than Gallagher's and probably the second best only to Bouchon of the restaurants I've eaten at in Vegas) and the best service I've had in Vegas (yes, better than Bouchon), it was worth it.  \n\nWhy 5 stars?  Because everything went right.  Was the service perfect? Almost.  Was the food perfect?  Almost.  Were the drinks perfect?  Almost.  Adding that all together with the right person I wanted to share the evening with, it was perfect.  (Although I didn't ever finish my French Laundry review, that place IS nearly perfect with whoever you go with.  It is still to this day, the best eating experience I have ever had and I've had the fortune of going there 3 times now.)\n\nNow if I could only remember the name of the Asst. Sommelier, I would give him a shout out here.  \n\nI am once again a fan of Emeril.  But please, no "BAM."	5	1	4	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Iko1Aq6MGqIKEfpb-kyKCQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

isNriefeJMt-Jn9pj0C2dg	5	2010-11-03 00:00:00	During a recent visit to Las Vegas, Delmonico Steakhouse was one of our top priorities. We had heard wonderful things about the food and this review was echoed when our driver commented that Delmonico was "one of the best steakhouses in the world." Upon arriving we felt like VIP guests. The bar was sleek and high class. We were there to celebrate and friend's upcoming move and this was the perfect setting. The dining room was tastefully decorated and the minimalistic style allowed us to focus on the delicious food and good company. Among the appetizers we tried our favorites were the Foie Gras and Crabcakes. The appetizers set the tone for what would be an incredible dining experience. I suppose it should go without saying but the next course was STEAK! Filets and Bone-in Ribeyes were the popular picks with the guest of honor going for the Filet Oscar (a filet topped with jumbo crab meat), which was the group's favorite. The steaks lived up to their reputation. The sides were a la carte and were great for sharing. And it was all tied together with a Sineann Pinot Noir from the expansive wine list. We enjoyed the meal so much we did not get a chance to try the dessert menu. Service was outstanding. Our server, Michael, was very attentive and enhanced the entire experience. Everyone ranked our evening at Delmonico amongst their favorite dining experiences. The food, drinks and service were top-notch and it was the perfect send-off for a good friend.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	EphmW35tOkHdhwObwqZFJQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
iTj2iW1NLosW9VTAkmCFVA	5	2009-04-29 00:00:00	Delmonico's is an interesting venue for dining. \nMy first impression was that the decor was very understated for a "quality dining"experience.\nAs we waited a short time for our table to be prepared, we were invited to the lounge and bar - it was not impressive.\nThe table selection, at first seemed unimpressive, but after a short while we began to appreciate our location.\nWe were seated near the entrance to the dining room, but were hoping for a table deep into the interior.\nAsthe evening proceeded, we found that we could have a very fine conversation, while those dining well into the room had to raise the level of their conversation just to be heard over the din coming from  the remainder of the room.  \nThe first component of the five star trating came with the extensive wine list.\nThe wine list will amaze anyone. A selection for every taste .....  \nThe service is also five star. Any need you have will be well attended at Delmonico's.\nI have a hard time believing that I went to one of the very best steakhouses in Las Vegas and ordered Salmon.\nI thought if Emeril Lagasse is associated with this steakhouse then the fish selections would be first rate.\nI was not wrong !\nI enjoyed the crabcake appetizer -  it was just supurb.\nThe BBQ Salmon was astoundingly good and cooked to perfection. \nA wealth of flavor in every bite. \nThe steaks ordered by the rest of the table were huge and exceedingly good.\nThe table shared a chocolate blackberry cake for desert and it was the perfect pair for a fine selection of tawny Port.\nOnce again, the service provided by the staff was excellent throughout the meal. \nSimply an amazing dining experience.\nFirst class all the way ...........	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	51UaY_JKrEOzA1CeEbuDNg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The pecan pie desert was actually the best part of the meal and the chicory coffee was horrible. Wine list offered $40.00 bottles of wine for over $100.00. Service was excellent which it should be when your paying so much money for your food. Ruth's Chris is much better steak and sides for less money.

Too bad I stuffed myself during brunch at Bouchon, I really wanted to try more at Delmonico.\n\n+ easy to make reservations via Opentable.com (in fact I changed my reservation easily via smartphone)\n+ great location in the Venetian/Palazzo restaurant row; close to multiple show theaters\n+/- huge restaurant (didn't notice from outside but there's a lot of tables)\n- sitting by the kitchen; another group asked to be moved too because the bus boys run in and out of there like their shoes were on fire, it was kind of nerve-wrecking to watch them\n- the place wasn't 100% packed even though it was Christmas so I don't understand why the wait service was meh (no butter, no bread until after appetizers, slow to refill water, etc.)\n+ waiter hadn't come back to take our order and a manger (or whatever the guys in the suit vs. the aprons are called) stepped in\n+ we ordered the Chateaubriand $105 (for 2) for the 3 of us ("no, it's not frowned upon" haha)\n+/- the sides that came w/ the meat was okay (the mashed potatoes wasn't as bad as everyone says and the asparagus was so forced - it's not even in season right now)\n+/- Traditional New Orleans Gumbo $10 was not worth it - it was decent but I wouldn't order it again or recommend it to anyone (and whats up with serving it in a small sauce pan on the bowl, then pouring it into the bowl - does that mean that pan was just on the stove top aka dirty? and I didn't even get a chance to pick out all the green onion before it got mixed in, sigh)\n+ Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad $17- pricey but it was tasty and this is coming from someone that doesn't like tomato unless it's in salsa form\n+ tasty wine and hefty wine BINDER ;-)\n\nWe debated ordering a dessert but none of it sounded appetizing. If you can get it at the buffet, save the calories.\n\nI may come back to try some more stuff but there are so many more restaurants I need to try the next time I'm back in Vegas.	1	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	NsqDhj79N8x5NamFCRLAsA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Nothing to jump up and down about. The petite ribeye was tasty. Just a minute over cooked, but overall it was good. The desert was ice cream and cake.

Being an Emeril restaurant I figured it was just another celebrity chef restaurant, so I had my reservations.  The place was well decorated and had a great vibe.  The food was up to par and certain items had great taste, such as the lobster bisque.  I was hoping for more with the wilted spinach salad, but it was still OK.  The complimentary amuse bouche was a nice touch, tasted like a truffle cream of mushroom.  Now the steak, everyone says to go with the bone-in ribeye, so that's what I got.  Tasty, but needed a bit more flavor.  Not as buttery and smooth as other high end steakhouses.  Service could use some attention for a restaurant of this caliber.  Forgot our truffle potato chips and service went downhill with the way they took our plates and such.\n\nNot sure I'd go back with all the other many celebrity chef restaurants to try, but it's definitely one of the better ones.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	fPvAAXp-B-fTS3_HOxvqlg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
iXUtnkAS3-tFp0qaw1sRuQ	5	2010-02-16 00:00:00	Took my girlfriend to Vegas for her birthday (and secretly, to propose), and was planning to take her to a nice dinner.  Went to Delmonico on a suggestion from a trusted friend, and damn, glad I did.  He may be annoyingly over the top on TV, but Emeril and company know what they're doing.\n\nRight from the beginning wait to be seated, until the ending dessert and coffee, we had a great time with great food.  In a "that is so Vegas" twist, our waiter looked like Wayne Newton.  They were great on recommending drinks and pick of entrees, and answered all questions off the menu.  Service was even to such a level that they helped my lady with her seat, which is good, since the chairs are heavy. \n\nAs to the food. . . *glarg* *drool*  Sorry, I get moisture in my mouth thinking about it.  Shrimp the size of my thumb after I hit it with a hammer covered in a fantastic spicy cream sauce, steak that you could cut with a spoon, a portion of the most tender venison I've ever had, that was just as good when cold the next day (because I couldn't eat all of it), a martini that made it harder to walk out of there than the amount of food I ate, incredible desserts, and well, an espresso menu that involved such quality coffee I had no idea coffee that good existed.\n\nI don't eat at high caliber steakhouses on a weekly basis or anything, but I've been to a few, and it's not like DC has a shortage of them given the wealth there.  Vegas is the same sort of way -- artificial city with lots of money -- and damn if Delmonico didn't top anything I've had so far when it comes to high caliber steak places.  \n\nAnd in case you're wondering -- she said yes.  I'm sure that was in part due to this dinner. ;)\n\n~EEE~	2	1	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ONuTrkL8rTRwNfyv4CfskA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
iYUK3plxMjTEo_6dkbS8gg	5	2015-12-23 00:00:00	This is what a steakhouse ought to be. Located in the Venetian/Palazzo complex, it's divided into several rooms, all pleasantly decorated. The ambience is relaxed and friendly. The wait staff is attentive without being overbearing. There's none of the pretense you get at, say Carnevino in the same hotel complex. There is a nice energy level but you can easily hear each other.\n\nWe brought a wine bottle from home and the wait staff was fine with it. They politely informed us of the corkage fee (a reasonable $30) without making us feel weird about having brought our own bottle the way some places do.\n\nWe started with a very tasty shrimp cocktail to share. Then I moved on to the Piedmontese boneless strip steak, which was delicious. Helen had the salmon, which was like butter. Potatoes au gratin made a nice side.\n\nEverything was perfectly cooked, impeccable in quality, and served with refined flair.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	g5y90qu7pZusdEZEn1NFYg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We were so exhausted that we didn't even bother pretty-ing ourselves up before hand...dumped out bags and headed straight to dinner.  We were worried that our shorts and flip-flop attire wasn't going to cut it but aside from some dirty stares from some of the other guests, the wait staff kindly turned their heads.  \n\nThe service was impeccable.   They started us off with a goat cheese puff pastry to cleanse our pallets, compliments of the chef.  All of us buddied up and ordered the Bone-in Ribeye Steak...which was plenty to go around.  Tasty, it sure was but I'd have to say, I've had better.  The garlic mushrooms, creamed corn, cheddar bacon grits, and sauteed asparagus sides were great compliments set in the middle of the table for all of us to share.  We were seated at a circular table which was ideal for conversation instead of screaming across a long table.  By dessert, we were stuffed...next time for sure.  \n\nSince we didn't order any wine to compliment the dinners that we all split, Delmonico left the robbing of our $$ to the casinos.  I know if I went with just my boyfriend, it'd be one less night we could stay at the Venetian.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	5lHDAZt627dfOUm71uaa6Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Either way, there are a plethora of whiskey options to elevate your safe, Emeril, food choices while at Delmonico. \n\nDelmonico is also home to a fantastic craft cocktail program...seriously one of the best in town...and also the reason that you should visit every so often. This as actually rather troublesome for me because given their range of whiskeys I'm forced to choose between flights whiskey, pours of favorites that you can't find most places and excellent craft cocktails...and the craft cocktails include every type of spirit, so even the problematic non-whiskey lovers can enjoy something amazing.\n\nSuffice it to say, Delmonico is home to 5 star adult beverages with typical 3.5 star Emeril Lagasse food.	18	11	19	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I have liked the filet at cut much better. \n\nCrab legs were bland but amazingly precut and offered at either a cold or hot temperature. \n\nThe lobster bisque was ok too. I think I had expected the greatness I found with McCormick's lobster bisque. Safe to say for the price I would probably go to cut again or lawrys or McCormick. Probably wouldn't want to go back here. Sorry kids. But that's just me.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	JQz2K1NnUqT5OqrNyht8vQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
J9PxPvvXUPYaDWlHOvk2Sw	5	2015-12-07 00:00:00	Celebrated hubby's birthday here.  The whole experience was top notch from the service, the food, and the attention to detail.  The moment we walked into the restaurant, the host greeted us by saying "Happy Birthday" to my hubby, which started the night great for us.  For once, I didn't get a side eye or a raised eyebrow when I asked my steak to be well-done; there was no snobby attitude from our server, and all the food we ordered was cooked to perfection.  Hubby ordered the bone-in ribeye (medium), I ordered regular ribeye, and we shared twice baked potato.  Their portions were so generous that we had no room for dessert.  Specialty cocktails didn't live up to my expectation and was a bit of a let down, but deceptively strong so worth the money.  Over all, really great first time experience here.  Oh, and a shoutout to our server Dale, who was nice, witty, and took care of us.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AZcrPTUbzOEvy-gr-2jZCw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The service was outstanding (I think we had three waiters just for our table) and the food was excellent. I had the sea bass and she had the pork chops, both were cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful. For desert they had root beer ice cream and I swear it felt like it was carbonated.

We ordered the calamari and homemade chips (really tasty) as our appetizers. The asparagus was enough for all four of us to eat (and only $9) the baked potato was hella good too.\n\nThe con: It is very pricey, steaks start off at about $48, but well worth it.

The waiter was very nice and knowledgeable and a funny guy.\n\nThe bone in ribeye was perfect. Medium rare, juice oozed out, flavor exploded. Exactly what you want. The grits were good too, but the cheesy potato side was a standout.\n\nWe had a hair in our dessert and our waiter brought over the manager, comped the dessert and gave us another dessert on top of that! The caramel cake and the creme brûlée were good ways to end the night.\n\nHonestly, I want to live in the steak.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	NYPSHpdJdDsp12lz6RoAUw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
jcQL_4-gGh7QgJNvxxuokA	2	2011-11-16 00:00:00	The excellent: 1) Waiter Frank was very helpful and personable and was dead-on with food recommendations! 2) the barbeque shrimp was the highlight of the meal; its sauce was so flavorful and a definite must-get item! 3) very nice touch of congratulatory dish written in chocolate and complementary dessert! The bad: we received NY strips instead of rib-eyes and steak not impressive at all; did not taste like it was a prime cut - too lean and very little flavor, although foie gras was cooked perfectly. Restaurant touts of 7 week aged beef but couldn't tell - have had more flavorful steaks from Costco. Won't go here again because of the unimpressive steak quality, even though service, ambiance, and appetizer was excellent.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	jQmb5FC9lXsvVx0vmwVD9w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
jDpTiAR5GxTxEei0kuQctw	4	2017-03-13 00:00:00	If you want a perfectly executed, consistent steak, this place is where you go.  Everything is the gold standard.   I had a medium rare ribeye that was wonderful.  Sides were great and the bread.... so good that you can just eat the bread alone.\n\nMy biggest issue, it's boring.  Really boring.  If you've had an expense account like me due to work, you eat at these places every month and although it's great, it gets boring.   Same type of people, same type of customers, dressed the same way.     I know... first world problems.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	j5ezF5mEGpnDwdTmAHci7Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
jF5o9G-bSLpy3W-tJmFfRw	5	2017-07-02 00:00:00	I think this place can serve bologna sandwiches and still get a 5-star rating solely based on how good their customer service and wait staff is here! We started out with the fried oysters and the petite wedge salads. The oysters were incredibly fresh and crispy. Do the pro move and ask the waiter to bring out some crystals hot sauce to put on the top if you really want to make it Cajun, also smeared some blue cheese on top of mine from my wife salad which made it over the top good. For the main course we split the Chateaubriand and the cut was really  nice and seasoned and came with a side of asparagus and Lebanese potatoes. On our next visit I think we will stick with getting just the bone in ribeye as it looked a little better and then ordering our sides ala carte. For dessert we had the banana cream pie which was not overly sweet and the contrast  with the chocolate shavings on top giving it that slight bitter taste mixing with that creamy goodness.  The cappuccino was very good and was the excellent end cap to an extraordinary meal.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	D3fOi-5w4intrUTWXzIQew	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

JjtJN_FIIatBJvxuSYAq0Q	5	2016-08-28 00:00:00	Excellent steakhouse. Well designed to be classy with some modern touches but not too modern you don't feel like you aren't in an old fashioned steakhouse.\n\nThe filet mignon done au poive was superb (5/5). Not necessarily the most traditional prep but the cajun seasoning combined with the crusted pepper and very tender beef made for an awesome bite.\n\nThe bone in rib eye (5/5) was also cooked expertly and one of the most flavorful and not too fatty pieces of steak I've had.\n\nThe shrimp cocktail (3.5/5) was nice but I thought standard cocktail sauce would have been better. The slice of avocado and sprig of microgreens made it nice.\n\nService was on point and very professional. \n\nWould come back here again. Thought it was better than Cut Steakhouse in the Venetian.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	fitXjNnwVB_HzqaBSrIGXQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Jjz9W-wBkoBoMcB8ZQs5zQ	5	2011-12-20 00:00:00	We had early reservations for a party of 9 for my 40th birthday. We were seated at a lovely table and were all surprised how we could hear everyone without having to strain. This means the acoustics in the room we were in were spot on. \n\nOur waiter was Lamont and there were various other folks helping us out. We were all served warm buttery rolls that had both a salt and we are pretty sure bit of sugar sprinkling on them. Drinks were ordered by a few of us-I imbibed just a bit as it was my birthday after all and the drinks were good, reasonably priced and tasty. \n\nEverything we ate was wonderful. We started with 2 orders of house made potato chips with truffle oil and Parmesan. They were yummy and the perfect combination of salt and grease to help the booze go down easily. Some of us had starters, some of us chose not to. \n\nI had the lobster bisque to start and it was heavenly with perfectly cooked lobster and nice pieces of it. Others had the Gumbo (no seafood-heat but not hot), the heirloom tomato and Burrata cheese salad. There were also a couple of other appetizers ordered-BBQ Shrimp (delicious and unlike anything we had before) and Escargot(I was too chicken to try it).\nTruffle Parmesan potato chips\n\nFor mains, people had \nFilets\nBone In Rib-eye \nSalmon\nScallops\nMedallions of beef\n\nSince sides are generous, we all shared:\nAsparagus\nCreamed Corn-delicious (and I make my own just as good)\nCreamed Spinach (the most boring)\nSauteed Mushrooms-fabulous\nPotato Gratin\nTwice Baked Potatoes\nGrits (meh-but not for me texturally)\n\nWe were all so full, we only ordered one dessert to share and that was the infamous Banana cream pie. Worth every bite and every calorie-in fact....\n\nKevin and I came back here for lunch our last day in Vegas!\nWe shared the BBQ shrimp, I had the lobster bisque again and he had the heirloom tomato salad. We also shared another slice of the banana cream pie and I would do it again in a heartbeat. \n\nFabulous birthday dinner and wonderful company!	9	7	8	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	9bxdPvAhP6cuipD5s2UnCg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

From the moment we got there we were greeted by the hosting area and whisked away to our table.  They pulled the chairs out for me and my guest and made sure we were comfortable.  They even asked if I wanted my jacket placed on the empty seat next to me, wow.  Head waiter came over and introduced himself and his team that were going to serve us for the night.  Sommelier came over and asked if I need any help picking out a wine.  being the wine geek that I am I had no problem browsing thru the incredible list/book and picked out a delicious red burgundy.  We ordered the truffled potato chips and boy were they good, yummo.  We skipped on a big appetizer because we didn't want to get too full.  We both ordered the Bone In RIb Eye and it was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten that I was sucking the tasty bone with no shame.  One incredible meal and one of the best I have had in Vegas.

It was obscene!!  \n  The chips were very good ; and the liquor and wine lists are some of the most complete anywhere . \n  The servers behind the bar were attentive but it was REALLY obvious that they have a slight touch of  animosity toward the guests.  Perhaps here in Las Vegas the guests are a bit abusive , that may account for the latent attitude .  Mind you , they don't display it to your face , but if You keep your ears and eyes open ,  you can easily pick up on the glares and hushed cross talk between them .  Given the world as it is though , can anyone expect them to be anything but a little jaded?  All in all , 4 stars	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	KPdRfht_1xjlsazMI1TGqg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

jMt1kywOn9nLZNoe55Y_lA	5	2011-11-20 00:00:00	Had an all around fine meal at Delmonico on our recent trip to Las Vegas.  I also went to Wolfgang Puck's CUT and gave it 4 stars on this trip.  The only real difference was that Delmonico cooked my NY Strip perfectly medium rare vs. just a bit over at Puck's place.  The rest of the meal from service to apps to salads was first rate.  The gumbo was yummy with a dark brick roux used and plenty of chicken, seafood and andouille to complement.  They put a big ole hunk of Maitre d butter on each steak and this, along with the Cajun seasoning (am assuming Emeril's trademark Essence) and the natural juices from the prime, aged beef lead to a wonderful liquid on your plate for dipping each tender bite.\n\nService was as attentive and on point as one would expect at these prices.  Sorry Wolfgang, Emeril wins this showdown by .5 of a star!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	33v8c5ftrKuDGTw1ZQ2toQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The food and drinks were excellent and there were many options to choose from.  One thing I find in many upscale steakhouses is a somewhat limited menu with only a handful of entrees and appetizers to choose from.

jQeYAZdOT5TkQPHatojkvg	4	2009-09-24 00:00:00	Simply delicious!\n\nI went with a group from work while attending a meeting and everyone seemed impressed with the food. We started off with a few appetizers including the calamari which was a little on the salty side, roasted butternut squash ravioli with duck and the crab cakes. \n\nI had the spinach and radicchio salad with apple rosemary vinaigrette and warm pistachio crusted goat cheesecake. Yep, that's right, you heard me... a goat cheese cake. It was fantastic. \n\nFor my entrée I was worried because I had already filled up on the appetizers and my delicious salad but I managed to eat my Filet Mignon medallions with a bacon peppercorn sauce.  We split a few sides as a table including the broccoli, asparagus and some delicious corn dish. I have no idea who ordered it but for the love of all that is holy, you have to get this corn dish. It was phenomenal. The broccoli not so much... too al dente for me!\n\nFor dessert there were a few orders of the bread pudding and banana cream pie which no one seemed to complain about. The service was a little slow but maybe it was because the place was packed. There was way too much time in between courses. Oh and it took at least 30 minutes to get drinks each round. Maybe go early before the rush hits or just don't go with a party of 13 like we did.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	J1YECKRnLha7XMIG95abPA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
jR4Y1Swah2urpXgAu_e_Kw	1	2017-03-06 00:00:00	We had dinner reservations here at 6:00 on March 4th, & I was excited to eat here because I use so many of Emeril's recipes at home.  We were seated promptly.  However, I stumbled on a chicken leg on the way to our table, & it was all down hill from there.  The 16 oz. Ribeye was flavorful, but overpriced, considering it was almost 1/2 fat.  When my boyfriend commented, our waiter laughed & said, "that's typical for a Ribeye" & walked away.  After that, we didn't receive any further service from him.  I had the fried chicken, which was $38, & came with black-eyed peas that had no flavor.  Our drinks were just Tito's vodka and cranberry juice at about $14 each.  I had one piece of chicken, & we were done.  The atmosphere was not warm & inviting, & the flavorless food was definitely overpriced.  We were incredibly disappointed & will not eat here, again.	2	3	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	iCMGkmY-Bh_68mH8cfhjoA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Also yes. \n\nI got the filet medium done, and my husband got the bone-in rib eye medium rare. My steak was perfection.. my husbands was too medium..

The atmosphere is simple and classic, it occurred to me that they were striving to feature the food with such simple ambiance, and they succeeded. \n\nThe service was fantastic, we had a team of servers for our party of 6 and we did not wait for a single thing throughout dinner. They did manage to find that balance between being attentive and hovering, it was perfect. Hubby and I had the table side prepared Cesar salad and it was excellent. For dinner I had the rare filet and I really enjoyed it, and the table shared the grits (my personal favorite of the entire dinner), spinach and mushrooms. For desert we had the peppermint profiteroles, which were so so (I'm not a big peppermint fan though). \n\nI really enjoyed dinner and highly recommend it for a nice dinner in Vegas.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	sYauKfRBquRxDwHA1a8EsA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
jXEaaJIF7LCp3ffm2cKXsg	5	2013-01-05 00:00:00	We have eaten here multiple times over the years.  We have enjoyed the chef's table on 3 different occasions, including a family dinner the night before my sister-in-law got married.  \n\nThe service is wonderful and we have never had bad service in the dining room, bar or chef's table. \n\nThe food is spectacular.  If you are a carnivore - thls is will be a religious experience.   The steaks, lamb chops, foie gras, fresh raw oysters, and \n\nA couple of things not to miss:\n        Appetizers: N.O. barbecue shrimp,  truffle, parmesan potato chips\n        Entrees:  American Buffalo ribeye, the bone-in ribeye, lamb chops\n        Dessert:  brioche bread pudding, Delmonico chocolate cake\n\nWine List:  I swear the darn book weighs 10 pounds.  They have an extensive wine list and it can be intimidating.  I have found the sommelier  has always been approachable (some restaurants have sommeliers that are kind of snotty or stand offish) and helpful.\n\nAdult Beverages:  I like champagne and wine but they have some really nice cocktails and I would suggest trying one or two.  \n     The Lady Lychee\n     A Tale of Two Cherries\n     La Flor Mayor - for a little kick  \n\nThey also have an impressive list of whiskey & whisky.\n\nThere are several seating areas of the restaurant, so you can have an intimate meal, a family get together or enjoy a group of friends.  I enjoy sitting on the long bench because it is comfy and I can people watch.\n\nIf you have a special event, reserve the Chef's Table but show up hungry because they are going to FEED YOU!  No tasting size dishes and they will toss in a surprise or two.  Like the time we had a wonderful ribeye main course, and thinking we were getting dessert, in walks another main course!  A spectacular lamb chop that was the best I have ever eaten.  \n\nAnd if you are just looking for some munchies and a drink - visit the bar.  Michelle is a great bartender and the food is the best bar food you will find.\n\nOr need your Emeril dessert fix - pop into the bar and have a dessert with a vintage cocktail.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	W7jFzFFxAj2SzpicETgXfQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
JY4UFdM66DM13Gw8f4bieg	3	2015-02-01 00:00:00	I agree with all the raves regarding the food however the restaurant itself lacks any real ambiance. Tucked away on the first floor of The Venitian we were disappointed by lack of personality given the location,  Vegas, and being so highly rated. Food, of course,  was excellent.  Loved my wilted spinach salad and the bone in ribeye was terrific.  Just anticipated more of a dining experience.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2WyWm7oyDyktCMbpwwGVkA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Was there last week for March Madness and came here with my boyfriend and a couple other friends. Our server, Frank, was amazing!!! We all felt really comfortable with him and felt at home. He made our experience very memorable. We talked about music, life, our home heritage and all sorts of stuff. I hope he's working next time we are in town. As for the food I ordered the wagyu filet which was thee best piece of meat I've ever had!!!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	jwUStgA7MpCxSE6WkoFOSg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

k0qS-yOEa0Qau4pIWjvAtw	3	2007-07-02 00:00:00	3 stars for the wine list.   2 for the steak.  I've gotta say that the service and ambiance was astounding given they let me bring my 3 foot tall yard full of long island ice tea, from the flamingo no less, to the table.  Greater than that? the wait staff were kind enough to fill it up with ice for me as I left it sitting there, as our center piece.  \n\nThe wine list was insane.  It must have been 50 pages.  In the end we ended up going with something simple because we were already pretty hammered from our fun in the sun.  The appetizers were decent from what I remember, but the anti-pasto salad looked like cold cuts from my mom's fridge.  It just wasn't presented well for the type of clout this place assumes.  So here I am, dining Euro style waiting 2 hours for the steak to finally arrive, chewing on my day old bologna and it finally arrives...\n\n...and it sucks!  I got the bone in rib-eye, one of my favorite cuts, and it was "toasted" excessively and really lacked any distinguishable flavor!  I couldn't believe that i was paying this kind of money for a steak I was making in my BBQ baby years.  And you know how sometimes things taste so, so good when you're trashed?  I couldn't imagine my feelings had I been sober.  \n\nBut I'm not so sure it was all bad - my friends had some pretty good Filet, and the soup was good from what I understand.  It's just not going to be MY first choice for a favorite dining spot in Vegas.  Like I said though, the wait staff was great, the wine list amazing, and the silverware clean.  \n\nEmeril - try again... and for you readers - try The Mesa Grill instead...	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	DN6erJry7mAq6jYeCxRrVA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

k9iCTuacLIGdjueMYxT0LA	3	2007-09-17 00:00:00	We were at DelMonico's last year to celebrate my boyfriend's sister's 21st birthday. That meant there were A LOT of us! The atmosphere was awesome, but then again, every restaurant in Vegas has some degree of nice ambiance, right? Anyhow, our large party wasn't able to sit together, which really sucked because we had made reservations and they expected all of us at that time. So, my boyfriend, me and his two cousins got our own mini-table. We all shared the caesar salad prepared table-side. It was seriously enough for all 4 of us, and it was very very delicious. I ordered the gumbo, and was very disappointed. I thought that gumbo would be Emeril's thing! It was slightly cold and WAY too salty. It was a nice little presentation though-- it came in a mini-pot and was poured into my bowl. \n\nI had the filet mignon and it was okay, and I wish I had ordered the duck. I can't really say why I only thought the filet mignon was only okay, but maybe it had to do with the fact that it was pretty salty too and I had just finished up a super salty gumbo? \n\nAll in all, it was a fun experience because of the atmosphere and because all of the family was there. Would we have had just a good of a time had we gone somewhere else? Probably. But, this was birthday girl's choice and it was kinda fun to go to a celebrity chef's place and criticize their food. :)	0	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	36TwWfrjSzrkWNmdqvPZzg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

kAD4Los7W4SqzKQvdaudfg	1	2011-08-30 00:00:00	Is there an email address I can complain to about my experience somewhere? For being the priciest place we ate at during my trip to LV, this was definitely the most disappointing. Service was incredibly aloof. The food was sub-par. \n\nFor 2 we ordered a few drinks, the Caesar salad and the Chateaubriand, both to share. The Caesar salad was delicious but how can you really go wrong with that? The main course was the absolute worst. Three pieces of meat per person, and it was barely lukewarm. I saw our server "heat" it up for maybe 3 seconds, and then take it off the grill. Although the meat was flavorful, the fact that it was almost COLD ruined the whole meal. Not only that, I asked our server to take a picture of us since it was my bday, and he handed over my camera to another server as if he was too good to take a damn picture!\n\nAt the end, we had a couple cups of coffee, and was given their birthday raspberry sorbet, which wasn't even edible. Overall NOT recommended.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	awqtQmC1QoUxOdmdQoeirQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
kAzO29fBDChaDZAlU-aBZA	3	2013-11-08 00:00:00	I love Delmonico's, I really do.  But this past weekend, it just didn't measure up.  I should have gone with my gut and given CUT a try.  We started with drinks in the bar, which was fine.  Our table for seven was ready on time, which is always nice.  Unfortunately, our service was super average compared to what I've had in the past at Delmonico's and at other comparable high end steakhouses.  My husband and I shared a salad for an appetizer.  We let the server know this when we ordered and in the past, we've had this served on two separate plates in lieu of having to divide the salad at the table.  Unfortunately, we were given to salad plates and told we could split it ourselves.  \n\nI love a good filet, and unfortunately, my filet was very average.  It was cooked to my liking, medium rare, but it was served relatively cool, which made me think that our food was sitting for a while before it was served.  My mom ordered seared ahi tuna which was served completely cold.  The outer edges were completely cooled after the searing, which again, tells me that our food sat out for a while.  My husband and my brother both ordered bone-in rib-eyes.  When the food was served, they brought one rib-eye that had been split in two.  The server went back to the kitchen and they realized they made a mistake and brought out the other rib-eye, while using tongs to take the half from my husband's plate and added it to my brother's plate.  Rookie move, seriously.\n\nMy family doesn't eat a ton of cards, so for sides we ordered two servings of the mushrooms, broccoli, and corn for my niece.  The server kept pushing for us to order a starch, which we insisted we didn't want- very bizarre, it's not like we weren't running up a pretty hefty tab.\n\nIt was my mom's birthday and I really thought Delmonico's would come through with an excellent experience.  The food was okay overall, but I really can't say that this meal met my expectations or anyone at our tables' expectations.  I've been to many Emeril restaurants, maybe they went through a recent management change??  I don't know, I wish I could explain the extremely average experience.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	n-6gqoEP9uQQBUnbKIu3RQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

kdxyf09J93EtngBY4cMvoQ	5	2012-05-23 00:00:00	What better place to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and Yelp Spring Break than in Las Vegas! I wanted to surprise my bf so I made reservations through open table for dinner at Delmonico. When we arrived the hostess wished my bf a happy birthday and we were told to have a seat in the waiting room. Wow that waiting room was super nice but also packed! Lucky for us as we turned around to scan for a seat the hostess called my name and said our table was ready.\n\nUpon being seated we were greeted by our server. He also wished my bf happy birthday and took our drink orders. When the waiter returned with our water he also brought some warm, soft, honey rolls the melted in our mouths. We decided to start with the Petite Iceberg Lettuce Wedge salad followed by a Twice Baked Potato ($9) and Rib-eye ($48) for me and Short Rib Special ($35) for my bf. Before our salads came out the waiter brought a small appetizer for us to share- compliments of the chef. I don't remember what exactly it was but it was so delicious!\n\nThe wedge salad ($13) was composed with petite iceberg lettuce wedges and topped with apple smoked bacon and red onion with buttermilk blue cheese dressing. There was A LOT of crumbled blue cheese on the salad- almost a little too much for me. It was enough for both of us to share and enjoy before we got our steak knifes and forks ready for what was to come next.\n\nI wish I were hungrier at the time- my rib-eye was HUGE! After the rolls and salad my steak and bf's short rib looked almost impossible to finish and it was quite a challenge. The rib eye was thick, juicy and tender- served with a slice of melting butter on top. Every bite felt so sinful as it tasted so good despite how full I was I couldn't stop indulging in more. I tried my best to eat my half of the twice baked potato. It was really smooth and rich with bacon and Vermont cheddar.\n\nI can't say much about my bf's short rib since I was too busy trying to finish my ribeye. I know he really enjoyed it and the meat was so tender it fell apart with a light brush from his fork.\n\nAfter dinner the server brought my boyfriend a complementary scoop of banana sorbet for his birthday. He likes bananas but usually doesn't like banana flavored foods. The sorbet was so fresh and smooth he actually really enjoyed it and finished! With a food coma coming on and $115 later we postponed surprise #2 (dessert at Serendipity) and cabbed back to our hotel and called it a night. Who does that in Vegas!?!? \n\nP.S. I can't wait back to try the Creekstone Farms Naturally Raised Angus, Carved Tableside for Two with Asparagus and Garlic Smashed Potatoes. Time to start saving up again...	4	1	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	BX-tpDEsVDXwE8ZatbZmRg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
KEAHrqN-1DV0gmuNHM6Eww	5	2011-08-24 00:00:00	As part of a birthday celebration weekend for two of my cousins, a group of us decided to head to Delmonico Steakhouse for a really nice birthday dinner. We had no idea what to expect of this place, except for the high prices. \n\nWe were running late for our reservation, but we called the restaurant letting them know we were on our way. It was a group of 6, so we really did not want to loose our reservation. They could not have been any more helpful over the phone! Directions were provided, and they kindly held our table until we arrived.\n\nUpon arrival, we were quickly escorted to our table. Our server kindly welcomed us and wished my two cousins a very happy birthday and memorable meal. After we all ordered our entrees, we were pleasantly surprised with complimentary appetizers for the entire group (halibut ceviche which was to die for!!). Their bread rolls were extremely delicious and always kept coming. Water was always replenished without even asking. Always a step ahead those people! When it came time to receiving our entrees, the wait staff made sure that all our orders were correct before setting them on the table. The dinner was then completed with complimentary sorbet (made in house). Everything was delicious!!! No one had any complaints about anything.\n\nThe service was excellent; above and beyond my expectations of any restaurant. I have been to other restaurants like Delmonico's at The Venetian for birthday celebrations, and none match the superb service and attention of Delmonico. Despite the fact that the restaurant's prices are high, the overall experience, taste of the food, and service make it an exceptional place for any occasion.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	xP1IYu2eGfxMWV9tjrurIw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
KeQy6Z03rnjMYj7lGalPwQ	5	2013-09-19 00:00:00	Long overdue review! Went back in July...and swore to myself I needed to give the place kudos because we had such a lovely experience. The food was delicious...and yes, it's a steakhouse, but I'd go back just for the banana cream pie. Oh...how I long for that pie. Anyway...the standout though has got to be the service. When our steaks came, I was disappointed to see that my steak had been overcooked - but it was clearly a busy night (and it looked like they had some crazy difficult customers that night), and I'm not usually one to complain, so I figured it still tasted good, and said nothing. But the manager, Ken, was nearby, and must've seen me sort of picking and inspecting my food, and he came by to make sure things were okay. I said they were fine, but he insisted on checking it out for me -- and in the end, even though I had already taken a few bites, he brought me a whole new steak and made sure it was cooked the way I liked before he left us to dine. That is fantastic service. \n\nFood was delicious, foie gras was heavenly (damn you California for banning it!), and the service top notch.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	vFDlBH31APVGFazd0L93aA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The bread and that butter with honey is amazing. \n\nI ordered steak, potatoes and broccoli and my bf ordered the ribs. \nWe both really enjoyed our food.

The lobster bisque, filet, and chocolate soufflé did not disappoint. The only minor complaint I have this time is with the cocktails. Too much ice and no garnish. For the type of restaurant it is, it should also not be using regular ice cubes from an ice machine. The drinks should not only taste good, but look delicious as well. \nI would not hesitate to come back here.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	YKUi4OEiOM_YLd4DHvVowg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Service is good beside the fact that there is a huge party in front of us.  LOL.  One of the best steakhouse in Vegas I would say.  Will come back during slower, non-trade show time to experience better service.\n\nOut of all the fabulous restaurants this hold one of the top rank on my mind.

This place is almost always five stars for me but this last visit I made then mistake and deviated from my normal order of filet mignon and did the surf and turf special instead. The lobster was good (not sure if I would say amazing since it was slathered in bearnaise sauce) but the steak was only so-so; not up to normal Delmonico quality. Covering it in the amazing house steak sauce did help but I wouldn't recommend ordering the surf and turf.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4hYlLptEJEIhQcb8k7QEqA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
kMffQjcePIsLul3y1dmf_w	5	2012-07-05 00:00:00	I have been coming to this place for the last five years and it never disappoints.  One of my Vegas go to dining spots.  Visited last Thursday again.  A few favorites:\n\nArrive early and visit Max the Bartender.  Just recently learned he is a world class mixologist (after ordering wine for years) and will create beverages that will make your head spin.  Has his own bitters collection to add a custom touch.  Tequila Gumption he made me was world class.\n\nI always get the Filet Pittsburgh Style and it is exceptional.  Not too loaded down with butter and just the right flavor.  If I am steaked out, The Salmon dish is incredible.  Creamed Corn is to die for with jalapeno seasoning topping (I am hyper critical of creamed corn but thing D's and STK are two of the best).  Biscuits that they serve are out of this world.  Potato chips with truffle oil are a nice indulgence.  Caprese salad is a great starter.  Like the wine list and not over priced like Del Frisco and the Wynn or Bellagio spots.\n\nFinish it off with a double espresso and you are ready to venture on into the evening.\n\nI prefer to sit in the main room and the seating towards the back is preferred.  Lamont is the best server by far.	2	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	m2n2KDQIyqPzn9wU5GjALA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We had a special gnocchi/lump crab appetizer, wedge salad, filet & ribeye, roasted potatoes w/garlic, and pecan pie for dessert. Food coma!

kot4mryGkVznop7jGLMCLQ	4	2015-06-26 00:00:00	I came for a restaurant week lunch with my two lovelies, Sandra and David and my husband joined before he headed to work. This 3 course was $30.15.\n\nThe 3 of us not working that day ordered beverages. This place made my heart sing because they had a Whisky BOOK. To be handed pages upon pages to browse on top of the other spirits, wine menu AND cocktail menus made my damn head spin because I wanted a lot of things. I settled on getting the Scarlet Starlet which had Glenmorangie 10, Tuaca, lime, hibiscus, strawberry and egg whites. It was totally up my alley - very much the scotch shined then the balance of the rest of the ingredients came through. Very much worth the $16 in alcohol and skill in mixing- the bartender Michelle was great.\n\nAppetizer I got VINE-RIPENED HEIRLOOM TOMATO SALAD (With Burrata Cheese, Red onion, Balsamic Vinegar and Torn Local Basil) which was standard, but good because the components were quality and fresh. \n\nEntree I got PAN ROASTED ATLANTIC SALMON( With Sweet Corn & Crab Vinaigrette and Fresh Basil) which was nicely cooked and was very fresh and clean. I liked the large pieces of lump crab mixed in with the corn. \n\nDessert the hubby and I shared:\n\nBANANA CREAM PIE PARFAIT(Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream and Graham Crumbs) was a solid dessert that could convince someone who doesnt like banana cream. The custard in it was creamy while still being light. \n\nTRADITIONAL BREAD PUDDING(With Warm Caramel Pecan Sauce) I love bread pudding and this was good, but average. I do appreciate that the caramel was flavorful while not being saccharine sweet.\n\nI thought it was a solid lunch, but I am coming back for drinks as there's very few places on the strip I've enjoyed the beverage offerings as this. Fantastic beverage program for the libation lover.	7	5	6	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Fantastic beef and you have to try the banana pie!\nI know that every restaurant has a bad day, but some of the bad reviews I read are completely ridiculous. My guess is that either too much alcohol was consumed by people complaining and/or these reviews come from people that think food trucks are fine dining.\nPrices are very reasonable for the great food and service.

I generally order beef cooked medium-well which tends to dry out the meat; however the chefs here knew what they were doing and delivered the most fork tender medium well i have ever eaten!  The maitre'd oversaw the dining sequence and operation with panache, though the grim-faced waiters could have used a few lessons on how to develop an engaging personality.  The prices were reasonable for Vegas top flight restaurants.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	oO_kqX4_Ca93Cw3tz39DyQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

At $85 the price is a bit of a turn off and there are other nice cuts available around a $50 range. Although, at 32 oz and being one of the best steaks I ever had in my life it was well worth it. Service was also fairly good although not superb.

kuqx7hFWC1GfWKPZZRXTSA	2	2016-07-09 00:00:00	Such a disappointment!  Here in Vegas with family, we're all a bit of foodies and selected Delmonicos for its reputation as a great steakhouse.  We've dined at other Emeril restaurants and been very pleased, including another Delmonicos location.  The ambiance of the restaurant was considerably lacking.  You expect a steakhouse to have that rich dark woods atmosphere.  This was very bland and nondescript in a city that does things to an excess..  The steak, a bone in ribeye was good but not OMG.  Barbecue shrimp appetizer and popovers were delicious.  Side dishes including the Au gratin potatoes were fair.  Banana cream pie is a must have.  The freezing cold restaurant added to the disappointment.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	w9oNVFP5uCrsl3-vb8aUGQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

L4Dur7bDYbQ6btWXtpGt6A	4	2014-03-10 00:00:00	In my opinion it's not fit for a foodie. Meal was very good but not superb. However, service was great. I wasn't impressed by their BBQ shrimp which was highly recommended as their signature appetizer.  Fish was cooked perfectly but most of the food only had 2 dimensions.  I expected more complexity and excitement in their flavors. Overall great for a cocktail and a good meal but Las Vegas has so many places in this category. I would love a large well known restaurant on the strip to go above and beyond. \n\nIf you aren't adventurous and just want a good meal with all your great basics on the menu this is perfect. It's a crowd pleaser but definitely lacking in excitement. \n\nIf I were to rate the food it would only be 3 stars but the service is very good so I gave them 4 stars. I will be back for drinks but it wouldn't be my first choice for food.	3	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	W5UE4LllnPipYa0470mIwA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
l6vwYPrwIyAWPsjjkyjSiQ	5	2007-08-13 00:00:00	I blame my father for my inordinate love of all things gourmet. Thankfully, I appreciate a good burrito as much as I appreciate a good steak, but I will definitely seize every opportunity to dine in style as much as I can.\n\nThanks to a family trip to Vegas, I got to eat at Emeril's, once more partaking our family's favorite pasttime: eating. We had eaten at the original location in New Orleans when I lived there, and it was one of my top 5 dining experiences of all time. This one definitely tied that experience.\n\nAs other people have said, if you're not going to eat steak in some form when you come here, you're wasting your time. The steak is truly a peak experience for meat lovers. We all ate our  steaks in silence, save for the "OMG!" and "MMMM!" and "wow.wow.wow."  They all had the filet mignon, and I had the bone-in dry aged ribeye: the best steak I have ever eaten in my life. It came on a bed of perfectly creamy garlic mashed potatoes and foie gras butter just melting into it. \n\nHave you ever had lightly tempura battered asparagus? It's worth coming here just to try them. \n\nEven the sides- delicious spinach he made without cream that was STILL good (shocking, I know), and broccoli cooked to perfection...we all kept remarking how absolutely everything was just perfect.\n\nThe other thing that distinguishes restaurants like this is the service.  Places like this are in a whole other league- waiters who seem to read your mind, appearing and disappearing before you even realized you needed something - never interrupting conversation, never hovering, always classy and helpful. Our waiter chose the perfect wine for us with with the vague descriptions of what we were looking for, and it truly was the best complement to our meals ever. \n\nThe design of the room is also a refreshing breath of fresh air from all the gaudy glitz and obnoxious 'bigness' of Vegas; simple, clean lines and understated elegance and chairs that make it seem like your table is totally self-contained and isolated from the other tables. Great to have that feeling of privacy.\n\nWe lingered for hours just basking in the glow of such perfection and decadence.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	-7hnKm0I8detrDCgsibKsA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
l7Rre1X2S6H7yDU-DQYyWw	5	2009-05-26 00:00:00	He may be a TV celebrity chef, but you can't take away credit where credit is due: Emeril is a fantastic restaurateur.  My wife and I have dined here twice; the first time because we were staying at the Venetian and the second time we purposely came back to eat here on one of our anniversaries while staying in Vegas.  In short this is a fantastic formal steakhouse experience all around.  What sold us was the Chateaubriand for two. Expertly cooked and finished off by table side with a flame of cognac for that over-the-top Vegas style experience.  Quite possibly one of the most memorable steaks we've had in our life. Tender with an explosion of flavor when you take a bite, mmm.  There are several wonderful side dishes you can choose to complement the meat and so far we haven't been disappointed in any of them whether you go for the vegetable of the day (garlic pan fried green beans the last time were there) or the bacon and cheddar grits, mashed potatoes, or baked potato. Oh and for your prerequisite greenery before the meat course they also do a fantastic Caesar salad prepared at table side for 2 as well.  Desert? Yes please!  You can't go wrong with their caramel cream brulee but everything on their dessert menu looked sweetly decadent.  I don't think I need bother describing the wine or drink menu here other than this is Vegas after all and if you possibly couldn't find what you're after here to complement your meal then I'm sure they could get it for you.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	dRympbHfv4vQvLnpPwOWPg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

With so many places to choose from we decided on Delmonico because it was in our hotel & we figured we couldn't go wrong at one of Emeril's restaurants. The dining area was very spacious & well decorated. The staff was very friendly and attentive to all our needs. I started with the wedge salad which was excellent. The bacon had a great smokey flavor & was crispy. The blue cheese was some of the best I ever had. My wife had the lobster bisque which was excellent as well. We the decided to try the Chateaubriand dinner for 2 which came with garlic mashed potatoes & asparagus. The meal is brought out and the meat is served table side. We ordered it medium rare & it was perfect for me. It had excellent flavor and was extremely tender. My wife would have preferred it to be a little more cooked in the center but she ate the outer pieces which for a little more well down but still tender & tasty. The potatoes & asparagus were both  perfectly cooked with great flavor. We passed on dessert because we were too full to eat anything else. I would highly recommend this restaurant & would eat there again when in Vegas!	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	yujZWE_uZn41f5-677Gvjg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

LFbYFfJw-QBDD5NSkNoYzA	4	2009-06-22 00:00:00	Had solo lunch at a table. The service here is some of the best I've ever encountered, hands down. Lunch may be a little more casual than dinner but there was no evidence of it in the level of professionalism. As time permitted, the staff really appreciated chatting about food and restaurants.\n\nI enjoyed the rich, super savory lobster bisque immensely. A meal in itself. The cajun salmon - featuring a nice salmon filet, french fried onions, and andouille hash - was prettty delicious. The best thing in this dish was the perfectly-cooked and seasoned salmon. While important to the overall combination, the cajun sauce was a little too gelatinous and as a result its sweetness was more cloying in my opinion. I thought had it been thinner it would have blended in more without overpowering with its texture. Overall the dish was very tasty.\n\nDelmonico's is extremely formal and professional but still has the makings of a fun place. I'd have to try their steaks to be able to really give it five stars.Reviewing other food in a steak place isn't completely fair.	3	3	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	7Ek4da_Btvznc4Q4S0_Bag	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

LfiPdqEyoSxPJ5JM8mXa4A	4	2010-09-18 00:00:00	Steak Lover's motto: A steak cooked beyond medium rare is fit only for dogs.\n\nLike many a Vegas Steakhouse, I feel like the excitement and constant crowds provide easy business to this high-end restaurant and that easy patronage has caused them to rest a little on their laurels. \n\nThe service I received was adequate but not commensurate with the price level of this restaurant. The side dishes were very good. The steak was also very good, but at this price, it should have been exceptional. \n\nThe ribeye was very tasty. It obviously came from a happy, well-fed and fatty bovine donor. The unusual cajun seasoned rub was also a unique and complimentary twist. It was cooked to the requested temperature (rare), and it tasted great. My beef with their beef is simple: it could have been served with a hotter searing, on a hotter plate, and in a larger portion size. For the price, I expect a larger steak than this, and for that reason, I would probably go to Mastro's next time. \n\nThe meal was good enough that I would still go here again for another try if I get dragged along by other friends. We'll see how that goes. Till then, bon appetit!\n\n-The Beef Baron	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	KrjV1CS-K05BBO_SjWPOGA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

lHSdGdLx0mN7f5XFJ13v-g	2	2008-01-14 00:00:00	I've been to this restaurant 3 times in the last 4 years.  The first time was amazing.  The bbq shrimp appetizer had big delicious shrimp, the steak was super tender and cooked just right and the service was impeccable, servers are there just when you want them and not more.  Also, the sommelier made an excellent wine suggestion that was reasonably priced.\n\nMy friends and I liked the place so much after the first time that we kept talking about going back the next time we were in Vegas.  The place was crowned as the place to go for our annual Vegas outing.  \n\nUnfortunately, the next two times I came back were utter disappointment.  The second time, I took my then fiancee.  We ordered the French onion soup, the BBQ shrimp and I had a rib-eye.  I forget what she had as an entree.  The French onion soup was gross, it tasted like dish water.  So we asked the waiter to bring us the Lobster Bisque instead.  It took us too long to find our server though.  To their credit, they took the french onion off of our tab.  The lobster Bisque was not special, very bland even for lobster bisque.  The shrimp came out very poor, the bbq sauce tasted burnt and the shrimp were small.  And to top the night off, my steak was medium well almost well done, when I had asked for medium rare.\n\nThe third time, I went with my friends.  The wine suggestion was poor and it was tres expensive.  Also, the food was just as mediocre as the second time I went.\n\nI give the place two stars despite the food being ok, because of the price.  Also, I think the service has gotten weaker since my first visit.  Hopefully, this place can get back into fighting form, but I won't know because I doubt I'll be coming back.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	oKLXD9P5JTBJ55DjsBzM0g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The team that waits on your table is awesome. But for the food... The foie gras was good... The Caesar salad was okay, too much dressing but good flavor, the creamed corn tasted good but had too much breeding, the grits are not  grits... More like risotto. My husbands ribeye was only okay and for the price it should have been better. The macnut bread pudding and the banana cram pie... Stay away they are NOT good.

LicwMCbMQkuJOEMCtWWIMg	4	2012-07-30 00:00:00	I had a late-ish dinner around 9 here on Friday the 28th of July after seeing Phantom at the Venetian because the restaurant was close to the theater. I noticed there was a piano in the waiting room but no one was playing it; instead they were blasting the sportscast on the TV which soured the mood. Once seated the atmosphere was largely pleasant but also a bit too loud and some of the staff seemed uncertain and nervous. Our head server in particular was not enjoying himself at all and was visibly annoyed by the group across from our table which was loitering around the restaurant for a long time after finishing their meal. \n\nThe meal itself was very good, especially my Bone-in-Ribeye which is their signature cut. It's a slightly glazed and massive piece of meat, rubbed with a Cajun sauce that gave it zest and even a bit of spice. It paired beautifully with the Bourbon-Bacon Manhattan I ordered at the bar. My dining companion had the New York strip which was fine but not nearly as memorable as the Bone-in. Like the cuts of the meat, the sides are probably too big and one side is more than enough for 2 people. However both of the sides we had (The Wild Mushrooms and the Spinach) were delicious so it would be difficult to pick one. The appetizers were relatively standard, with the exception of the Parmesan-Truffle Chips but be forewarned that delicious as they are they are very filling and quite greasy.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	IOf-UvT_gfpP1c7s3HYx3Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

It was perfectly cooked and I was satisfied. It's pretty big but I still finished mines cause it was bomb. Ordered a bunch of sides too which were good. Nothing too special about them. However don't order the chicken my sister doesn't really eat red meat so she ordered it and it was dry. We ordered two desserts the banana cream pie and the butter cake. Both were good but the banana cream pie was exceptional!

I had the petite lettuce wedge... ok.  I had the BBQ Salmon.  Was not impressed.  It was cooked to the stated level, cut of fish was good but the BBQ was not good and the sausage potatoe hash was lacking.

NYC steakhouses are shamed by this Vegas institution.\n\nService has always been impeccable.  The sides and apps are great (I like the steak tartar), but the bone-in ribeye is the king of all steaks.\n\nI've been to Vegas twice and to Delmonico's twice.  It's the only place I insist friends visit when they go to Vegas.  It's better than craps or blackjack!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	m1ASyEJcf-Ig8vEtYK1eDA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Lkqk75-P4zD1LWVxBuin8w	5	2012-06-10 00:00:00	WOW. This place did not disappoint. I had a pretty high expectation, especially after seeing 5 reviews (yeah out of 600+ lol) that said the steak might be better than Mastro's my most favorite steakhouse. \n\nBeing a true tubby at heart, I was the only one who ordered 2 appetizers lol. I had the BBQ shrimp (it's aight), wilted spinach & frisée (super delicious), and I tried the ravioli too (my friends loved it but it's aight for me maybe because I wasn't feeling like pasta). \n\nI had the Chateaubriand for my main and I lovvvveee the Creole seasoning on it. It was served with a huge handful of asparagus that looked really fresh and mash, which tasted delicious with the creole juice/sauce. My medium-rare steak was cooked perfectly and was super delish. Mastro's steak still wins though!\n\nWe also had a side of grits (good) and creamed corn (yummy). And for dessert, as usual we had a buffet of it. The best ones (in order): Bourbon bread pudding, pecan pie, espresso Creme brûlée. The chocolate cheesecake just wasn't my thing. My hubby also had their Blue Mountain coffee and he seemed to like it. \n\nI'm happy this is a chain (lol) because Delmonico is going to my regular/Yum Yum list!!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3SBz-sGpkvlWbLQ_jaDWAA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
LlsUNjofEho5y2KRqHFmmQ	4	2009-09-05 00:00:00	I wanted to get a nice steak while in Vegas.  There were several options in Venetian/Palazzo alone.  I picked this one because, well, bam!  No but I figured a guy like Emeril Lagasse would make sure his steakhouse served a nice steak.\n\nThe decor inside is nice and clean, not a whole lot going on.  The opposite of a Red Robin, say.  Service was duly attentive.  Caesar salad prepared table-side was a treat.  \n\nWe went with cocktails over wine from the rather pricey and extensive wine list.  I didn't even eyeball the list personally.  But a generous portion of Bombay Sapphire satisfied nicely.  \n\nI went with a bone-in New York, medium-rare.  It was cooked expertly.  It had great texture and flavor, a nice creole seasoning rub on there but not too heavily applied.  The beef did the talking.  Or the mooing.  It was good.  Only ordered one side on account of a late lunch and we're not rich: mushrooms sauteed in butter.  I feared some pain old sauteed buttons would come out.  But I was rewarded.  A hearty mix of flavorful 'shrooms, like oyster and chantrelle and maybe porcini or shiitake came out.  Lovely.  And buttery.  and Garlicky.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	owt9zEAz7ZehK4CVDq2YGQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

And they even cooked two steaks. \n\nIs your steak fine? After all your friends have eaten? Yes.  It's fine because I don't want to wait around for you to screw up anymore.  \n\nOnly saving grace was the bourbon.  \n\nBasically, screwed up on steak.  Luke warm coffee.  Oh hell, might be a bad night, but my five other friends had good dinners.  Didn't want to bitch and spoil their evening.	2	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	tDXA9Tb_JhURPga3EhQb5A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

They started us with a complimentary thin slice of cucumber topped with tiny lentils, a tasty tidbit. We then had the lobster bisque which was very good with large chunks of lobster in it. My husband had the bone- in NY strip,medium rare, it was grizzly and very chewy, not worth a price tag of $50. I had the petite Piedmontese filet mignon, 6oz., although extremely small for $50.00 it was very good. We were then given a small scoop of complimentary blood orange sorbet and finished the meal with the pecan pie, good but not memorable. With all the steakhouses in Vegas we have no reason to return here.	0	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	M3YpU8fRyTZAQIn08bDT4g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Their food and service has always exceeded my expectations.  Secondly, their Pan Seared Foie Gras literally took my breath away because I was enjoying it so much I damn near forgot to breath.  That is saying a lot because normally I don't like liver!  For a quick recommendation, try their filet mignon, duck or ask for their filet medallions, it is off the menu but the flavor is amazing.\n\nFor a full review read my post at:\nhttp://foodilistic.com/reviews/delmonicos-las-vegas/	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	TYlHUHjyu3GUGj52cPRGIw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad with Burrata Cheese, Red Onion, Extra\nVirgin Olive Oil, Balsamic Vinegar and Torn Local Basil.\n- I was a little sad that the Burrata cheese was so small compared to the heirloom tomatoes, but it was delicious!\n\n2. Butternut Squash Ravioli with Sage Brown Butter, Toasted Hazelnuts and Parmesan\n- OMG!  SO GOOD!  The squash was divine.  I would definitely order this again.\n\n3. Grilled Marinated Organic Chicken Breast - Roasted Fingerling Potatoes, Whole\nGarlic, Wild Mushrooms and Natural Reduction\n- The person that ate this said that the chicken was cooked perfectly and had really good flavor.\n\n4. Filet Mignon w/ a twice baked potato (with Bacon and Vermont Cheddar) and a Caesar Salad.\n- He said that the steak melted in his mouth!\n\n5. Surf & Turf- bone in ribeye and crab & buttered Fresh Asparagus, I believe. (I don't see it on the menu, so it must be a special)\n- My husband cleaned his plate.\n\nWe also ordered two desserts:\n1. Delmonico Chocolate Layer Cake - Chocolate Pudding, Coconut Ice Cream and\nToasted Almonds\n- Looked delicious.  They said it was good and the coconut ice cream was amazing!\n\n2. Pecan Pie with Oatmeal Shortbread Crust French, Vanilla Ice Cream & Caramel Sauce\n- Pie was in the shape of a circle, so the center was ooey and gooey and yummy!!  Very good!\n\nPrice was about $300+ for the table (not including tip).\n\nThe service was OUTSTANDING!  We actually had 3 people waiting on us and never had to ask for anything.  They were on-point with re-filling the water at the table!  It was SO nice to never have to look around for someone to help us.

Lxreuj-3-XpxFyE0pr1nKA	2	2014-06-15 00:00:00	My family went here for Fathers Day at noon. The place had a very nice atmosphere. We sat two minutes after checking in.  Five minutes later, a waiter approached us and took our order for drinks. He introduced himself and another waitress. We got our drinks and ten to fifteen minutes later, a different waitress gave us bread.  A person in a suit then approached us to ask if we were ready to order. We replied, "Yes".  He then walked away instead of taking our order. I would assume that he is the manager.  A different waitress then approached us to Finally take our order.  This took more than half an hour from the time we sat down.  Sad thing was that the table behind us sat after we did and was already eating their appetizer before someone took our order.  Mind you, we sat before several customers and they were attended to first. Very very poor start of customer service.  I would think that this place would have excellent service consistently.  Another, I had black slacks on. I placed the napkin on my lap, and behold the napkin left tons of white lint on my black pants.  I went to other restaurants in Vegas and I was offered a black napkin to use instead.  Others, the napkin did not leave as much lint as this one did. I ordered the lobster bisque, which was excellent. Creamy, smooth, and a lot of flavor.  I also ordered the filet medallions.  It had panko breading which I really didn't care for.  The bacon was charred and hard, but the two filet medallions were great.  It also had a simple sauce with small mushrooms. My dad had the lobster sliders.  The sliders were surprisingly great according to my dad.  They didn't skimp on the lobster.  Instead of shredded pieces, they are a generous portion in the sliders.  The bread they offered got cold pretty quick but it was still good to eat.  At first, drinks were coming in slow. Then the waiters paid more attention to us in the end.  The restroom was located all the way in the very back.  I thought I had to exit the building itself to use the restroom.  You have to through a very long hallway to the very back towards the exit sign.  The sink was shallow and I could barely wash my hands in it since it's so shallow that my hands will get wet from the dirty water in the sink.  There was only one sink available.  Food would have been excellent.  Service was mediocre.  I'm not sure I would return here if I have this kind of service.  It was my first time here.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ct0M5jJSLn5_s7hd-camVg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The atmosphere itself was nice and the restaurant wasn't very busy, but one of the first things I noticed was that it usually took a lot more effort than I would expect at a nice restaurant that wasn't crowded to begin with to get our server's attention. The servers themselves were great and always helpful but just seemed to be pretty absent most of the night.\n\nThe food itself was very good. The pre-dinner rolls were light, which I liked so you didn't get too full on bread before your actual meal came. I ordered the BBQ Salmon. A lot of other plates at our table were the rib-eyes. Everything was cooked perfectly, and my only complaint might be that the salmon was really heavy on BBQ sauce. Portions were large enough to be worth the price, but it really depended on the items ordered.\n\nOverall 5 for food, 3 for service.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ehH-ALlOxTvci6xZJ90nGw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Located in restaurant row in the Venetian, this place is an Emeril restaurant that features steaks and sides of high quality.  \n\nA few of my party actually shared the rib eye because it was a really bit cut of meat.  That combined with the great sides made a wonderful meal.  Service was impeccable as our waiter and other staff were engaged and always on top of what we needed.\n\nFor sides, I'd suggest the grits and bacon.  I ate the whole side dish and barely shared with others.  The creamed corn was surprisingly good and the brussels were also really good.  For dessert, we had the strawberry shortcake which came in a jar which was terribly good.  We also had the chocolate cake and key lime pie.  I didn't try too much of that as I was stuck digging my spoon in the strawberry shortcake. \n\nFor a great balance of food and service, I highly recommend.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	44nGn-w5iaPkp639RJfTWQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

As mentioned, my boyfriend and I were still stuffed from lunch so we went for the Cesar salad for two and each got a potato on the side. The salad was so fresh and delicious, and made right at the table. The potatoes were almost too big but delightful. Everyone at the table had what looked to be an amazing steak, the one bite I stole was heaven.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	j9JbJVVvgnmJxZktD5o0Iw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
mAzobkZpvkMZx9ZHhpoHPg	1	2010-12-24 00:00:00	Wow, I can't believe this place getting 4 stars. BAM to POOF to me.\nFirst off the bread ... if you do not know now to make a simple bread ... how hard it is ... even my homemade bread taste better than that hard piece of rock they served. \nMaybe it was just a bad day for me. But it cannot be that bad right. nooo ... but sorry to say ... it is a yes for me.\nWaiter ... service ... zero! rude and didn't ask if we are done and took everything away ... but the food was bad anyways take it away as fast as you can.\nJumbo shrimp and petite fiilet mignon ... non fresh shrimp made for bad combo plus ... I ordered medium rare and it came out well done. hmm ... either the waiter doesn't know how to write his order or the head chef or whoever is cooking is just as bad as emeril lagasse himself. \nThen to coffee ... argh ... disgusting ... and we were like complaining and the waiter came by and asked ... we can brew a fresh one for you??? ... i was like WTF ... this was not a fresh brew to began with ... argh disgusting and chills all over my body ... so time to get out pronto!!!\n\nThe only good thing that came out of this is the wine we ordered ... they have an extensive selection and kudos for that ... \n\nBut I am never going back ... $55 for the entree ... I rather go to McD and I know what I am getting for $5.50.\n\nThank you Dad who said that my cooking with a costco steak is better than whatever they whipped up at demonic ... haa haa.	0	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	OzmMjN97kh7JpnGoC1adSw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Didn't have to wait long for anything, and I really like that the whole table is served at the same time, it's a nice subtle touch. Very attentive and friendly service.\n\nI enjoyed the experience and was not disappointed even going in with a high expectation.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	0eYz8b4wt6ylt4bLtlGm1w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
mDGtk-ZVFD6ly07Nw0ksjw	5	2015-12-22 00:00:00	Everything about this place was amazing.  The food, the service, the ambiance, it couldn't have been better.  We began our meal with bbq shrimp, bone-in bacon, and lobster bisque, all of which were delicious.  Now on to the steaks. We ordered bone-in ribeyes and this was by far the best steak I've ever had. It was perfectly prepared and the flavor was out of this world. For our sides we ordered sautéed mushrooms and grits, both of which were equally delicious.  We finished our meal with dessert and we ended up with two, the pecan pie and the caramel butter cake, both of which were, you guessed it, delicious!\n\nLet's talk about the staff and the service.  From the host that greeted us when we walked in, to the gentleman that walked us to our seats, to the three gentlemen that served us, everything and everyone was absolutely delightful.  The three gentlemen serving us were Rene, Brian, and David, and they ran like a well oiled machine.  They were very attentive and very pleasant people, and they helped make our dining experience so wonderful. \n\nThe ambiance was perfect for our early xmas dinner.  We had a table where we were able to comfortably eat dinner, have a conversation without screaming at each other, and we weren't wedged between other people being forced to share our dining experience with strangers. \n\nDefinitely a five star establishment with five star food and five star service. We will definitely be back.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Gg4h1QqSdwVq2BkFc_99Dw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The reason I say this is the place  you want to go is because  the service is as good as the meal.\nYour not stretching your neck  looking  for your server.  Water glasses were always  full and our steaks all landed  at the same time  by 3 servers.\nThey have a seamless flow to the meal.

mFQ3ix1VK3KkfxvTmKSE-w	4	2009-02-21 00:00:00	Delmonico's is a great place to dine while staying in Vegas (especially if you are staying at the Venetian).  \n\nService:\nThe distinguishing characteristic here is the service.  We had 10:00pm reservation on Valentine's day and were flying in to Vegas to meet friends for a weekend getaway (got that? good).  Our flight out of SFO was delayed and we ended up arriving at the restaraunt at 10:48, long after we should have been seated etc.  Our waitress was the essence of efficiency; without missing a beat she let us know that last orders were due at 11:00.  They key here was she always made us feel like she was on "our team" rather than making us feel as if our lateness at created an inconvienience for her.  She helped all six of us get seated and get our orders in "before the bell" (as it were).  She got a $100+ tip for being a pro.\n\nFood:\nThis is a steakhouse, order a steak.  Mine was flavorful without being fatty or gristly, pink without being bloody and just the right amount charred on the outside.  This was the ribeye steak, but the bone-in ribeye ordered by one of my partners in crime was equally well-prepared and duly appreciated.  My wife thought her crab-stuffed halibut (wrapped in a potato skin) was good (but not great?).  \n\nCost:\nYou won't find an entree for under $50 and the sides are extra (we had a group of 6 so that actually worked out wonderfully and we ended up dining quasi-family-style).  The asparagus and mushrooms were hits!  With tip (21%), the bill came to exactly $100/person.  I think we all had at least one drink and the girls split a bottle of wine, one desert and a few coffees were ordered.\n\nBottom Line:\nThe service here was friendly and professional.  The staff make you feel welcome and are eager to please.  The food is extremely good and a decent value (it is Vegas after all).  Go here if you like steak and are willing to pay a little extra.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	EoViGKm29pxG3ikAvEAiGg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
mgn_MBt6ONSMCOyco6dSgQ	5	2015-05-20 00:00:00	A 5  rating for a 5 restaurant. Located in between the beautiful Palazzo and Venetian Hotel, this restaurant and their staff truly were amazing. From the moment we walked in, every staff member was attentive to our needs. They truly took care of us (party of 7), the waiter was amazing and truly enjoys his job. The food was amazing! Everyone enjoyed their meals and salads/soups. We had a slight small incident with my mom who slipped as we were walking in, and every couple of minutes the manager in charge, Tyler, came and checked on my mom several times. Despite the fall, the restaurant is amazing, we were happy we choose DelMonicos for our dinner!! Keep up the great job!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	xZac7asX28_KaLlvaoDZ7g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

miW64R3yPbSWwCJtjKqv9g	4	2007-03-05 00:00:00	So, I've always thought Emeril was a lot of talk and no action, but I was wrong to judge without experiencing Emeril's cooking. \n\nOn our first night in Vegas, we made last-minute reservations for 9:30.   The restaurant is in kind of a weird place.  It's literally in the corner of the basement.  Granted, there are restaurants next to it, it still felt like it was at the edge of the earth.   Inside is relaxed.  It's dimly lit and the ceilings are low (again, more basement feel), but overall, it's very nice.\n\nWe were starved, so we went right to the entrees, but they were delicious.  My boyfriend, the meat-eater in the group, had the filet, which he claims is the best cut of filet he has ever had.  He says it was cooked to perfection and it was absolutely perfect.  And, he's had quite a few steaks.  I had bacon-wrapped sea bass with pesto, roasted tomatoes, and some potato goodness, that I can't remember.  I mean, in all honesty, I wasn't expecting to be impressed, so I didn't pay much attention to the intricacies of the dish.  But, it was amazing.  The fish was cooked perfectly, the flavors were a perfect compliment to each other.  It was perfect.  \n\nAnd, for dessert, we shared the banana cream pie, which I knew was legendary, and quite frankly, it was the only thing that disappointed me.  It was good, but I think I expected more.  Regardless...this was a great meal, and well worth every penny.\n\n5 stars for food, minus one for weird location and ambiance.	2	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AZRxphVG3RjljoJ7QD39zg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
MJ5WODvmESSg5uIbycUNFg	5	2009-12-12 00:00:00	Another large group dinner with the co-workers, this time we selected Delmonico Steakhouse.  Wow, I am impressed.  This is what I call classy.  I didn't even realize this was an Emeril Lagasse restaurant until I examined the doggie bag afterward!\n\nThe food is top notch, I ordered the butternut squash ravioli (sans duck confit) and the wild arugula w/ raspberries.  Both dishes were just the right size (not too big, not too small), beautifully presented, perfectly seasoned and dressed, and absolutely delicious.\n\nWe ordered and shared the green apple crisp a la mode for dessert, I might have loved it more if I was still hungry, but I was so stuffed that I couldn't properly enjoy it.  Note to self: next time, dessert first!\n\nLiterally, there was not a single bite leftover from anyone's plate.\n\nIn regards to the service, our server Jen was such a sweetheart, she seemed like a friend right from the start.  Not too intrusive, but relaxed and attentive.  Very accommodating and down to earth.\n\nMust try items: Homemade potato chips with parmesan, truffle oil and scallions.  I was stuffing my face like no tomorrow and scraping the plate clean...The warm dinner rolls w/ butter...They smelled SO buttery!  Lastly, the corn gratin, the panko topping was so crispy, it was unreal, the gratin underneath was hot, steamy, and sweet from the crisp fresh corn.  SOOO GOOOD!\n\nAll in all, this place was expensive, but none of the staff had to overdo it to impress us, the atmosphere, food and service spoke for itself, so it was worth every penny.\n\nLOVE	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	G66J4Z0l0kXBKBhbgqm1IA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

mJmGzPCPepPPJ0HT4WcClg	5	2011-09-16 00:00:00	Hands down, the best meal I've ever had.\n\nMy boyfriend and I were 20minutes late to our reservation, but they stil accommodated us within 2minutes after getting there. We had THREE servers: one for wine, one for food, and one for.. I don't even know, just to make us feel like royalty!\n\nWe ordered the bone-in rib-eye and the filet mignon. Although the bone-in rib-eye is the most popular steak at the restaurant, my personal favorite is the filet mignon just for its AMAZING tenderness. I'm really bad at describing taste with words, so all I will say is this: perfection. And you HAVE to pair the steaks with the house red wine. It transformed our meal even more.\n\nAnd for dessert, we got the banana cream pie.. and I wanted to cry. That honestly the best way for me to describe my experience. I took one bite, and wanted to cry. "It was the best tasting dessert I had ever had in my life" is an understatement.\n\nFinally, I loved the look of the restaurant. It wasn't as dimly lit was I thought it would be, which I actually was pleasantly surprised about because I'm tired of not being able to see my food. The design is very minimalist but still very sophisticated.. but not TOO sophisticated that regular folks like my boyfriend and I didn't feel out of place.\n\nAlthough it was incredibly expensive, the food and the overall experience was so incredible that even my boyfriend, who can be pretty frugal sometimes, said that Delmonico's HAS to be a place we go back to EVERY year. I can't wait for the next time. :)	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	FcDt9te86dUhyClZy2YQoQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Mjqw4AT_tRJ2cMS2bjrzFw	2	2016-10-04 00:00:00	More like 2.5 stars.\n\nCame in for a late Friday night dinner. Started with martinis - awesome.\n\nMy wife and I both ordered filets cooked medium. The steaks came out super fast and were unfortunately super rare. My wife decided to eat hers, but I sent mine back. My steak came back closer to medium rare than medium, and the flavor was gone. I waited at least ten minutes for the steak to come back, and it was a miss. On top of that, my filet's cut was poor. The sides were fine - mushrooms and twice baked potato.\n\nI kind of felt that the kitchen and management really blew this for us. At a place with a price point like this, walking in just before closing shouldn't impact the food quality. I feel like the kitchen wanted the steak out ASAP so they could shut down for he night. On top of that, no manager came to say a word about the mistake, and nothing was done to compensate for it - no comped drink or dessert or even a "sorry" from the management. I think that this is inexcusable considering this is an Emeril restaurant and is quite pricey.\n\nNot sure we will return, which is too bad because we are fond of the place from past visits.	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	1F6JY4g4T8BkYPPsz1FPaQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

One thing I noticed was there were way too many employees waking and standing around and it was very distracting at times. As for the food, other than the Bone in Ribeye steak which was decent considering the portion and the price, everything else was a real disappointment. I got better lobster bisque at Lobster ME next door for $4, I mean A Lot BETTER. Their soup was awful.\nI really wanted to like this place considering it was our wedding anniversary but it was a real letdown.	0	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	49eMil-dGqIG20KBWdVAZg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

mln-H9-8tKeYGqiwDPACMA	2	2015-08-17 00:00:00	I'll start out by saying the service and environment were both great.  Delmonico seems to draw a good balance between those hyper-formal restaurants where utensil etiquette matters and more casual fine dining restaurants. \n\nI tried the foie gras and octopus appetizers.  The octopus was delicious and had a decent amount of meat.  The foie gras was rich.  I followed these with the gumbo which had a mild spiciness that anyone should be able to enjoy.\n\nThe disappointment occurred during the main course.  Three of the people in our party ordered the filet mignon.  Two of us were immediately dissatisfied with the plate.  I had ordered medium-rare and my dissatisfied friend had ordered theirs rare. My filet was noticeably dry and neither were especially tender. I suspect mine may have been overcooked because the third filet was also a medium-rare and the butter on top of their steak was still present, whereas mine had altogether melted by the time the plate reached our table.    Additionally, whatever seasoning was used for my filet was not spread evenly.  There was only one bite where the seasoning became obvious and it overwhelmed the flavor of the meat.\n\nFor a steak that costs over $50 at an establishment that is a steakhouse, I hold it to certain standards, like being appreciated by a majority of the people at my party who ordered it. I can understand one person not enjoying their steak at a table because they have specific preferences, but for two people at the same table to be dissatisfied makes me believe the quality of the cooking is unreliable.  I have definitely cooked better steaks than the ones I tried  during this meal, and unfortunately this is the first steakhouse I have been to where that has been the case.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	USdzc0xTlBXBoFUiI4R12A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Each came out exactly as ordered and at exactly the same time! The steaks were a lot bigger than expected and we had to ask for doggie boxes. (We finished it off the next day!) Great wine selection. Great service.\n\nMy only complaint is the table are too close together and if the people next to you do not bump you, the waiter does as he passes between tables. That was a real pain. They need to rearrange the seating. Ask for a corner table to avoid this problem. If they fix that, I would give them five stars.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	TbzOfYNd4QR17KhxjHzy4Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

It's extremely hard to cook good duck, but they nailed it! Then I got the filet minion, medium rare. It melted in my mouth. It was amazing. It may have been more on the rare side, but I had no complaints. To finish off my experience I got the bread pudding. Just like the filet, amazing. The pecan buttered ice cream and the warm bread was bigger than it looked - but had no problem finishing it. In our group of 3, we each got a different menu item - I feel like what i got trumped the other dishes. Try it!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	LLoAH_k07N7Iy47IbQqOkg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
mNXglIne0uKvXn5Gwhd_ig	2	2012-10-08 00:00:00	While on an extended stay at the Palazzo we decided to try Delmonico. I made a reservation through Open Table. We were seated promptly but at a table that was less than desirable where the waiter had to stand behind me while serving us. He was quite pushy and brusque. My wife ordered the half duck as she loves duck. Right after we were served the waiter returned and asked if everything was OK, My wife had taken one bite from the duck leg and she said that things were OK. But as she continued to work on the rest of the duck it seemed to become very tough like it had been over microwaived. She signaled the waiter over and rather than handling it professionally he asked in a rather accusing manner why she had said the duck was OK when first asked. This made us feel very uncomfortable. The waiter did remove the duck and did not charge us for it. However, we just wanted some excellent food. I'll never return to any of Emeril's restaurants based on this encounter. If you want a good meal while at the Venetian / Palazzo go to Bouchon where you'll be treated well and the food is great. Just to be balanced I will say that the rib eye that I had was good.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	k65LutNApSp6r_rxmq973g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

When I called the woman who answered said no problem. The bartender was exceptional, stearing me towards a good whiskey. Of course the steak itself. To describe the steak would only cheapen the experience. Very worth the money.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	yMJMXnNzkfSKtueUGzpg2A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
MoZgmok1vMVIibWvZ0BJWA	5	2009-03-24 00:00:00	Top notch steaks and one of the best wine lists in Las Vegas. Perfectly seasoned and prepared steaks in the main dining room makes for a great night out, but what makes The Delmonico Steakhouse a DESTINATION is their individually planned and prepared tasting menu, available during an evening at their special Kitchen Table. \n\nThey have a glass room with space for 8, connected to the kitchen where you'll enjoy a special tasting menu prepared by the Chef on duty. And when I say special menu, I mean just that. Chefs are passionate about menu planning and specialty food and they'll give you a 6-8 course meal featuring the steak of course, and many other things not available on their menu, finished with a dessert tray to die for, featured every one of the desserts they offer. \n\nThis is an Emeril restaurant but you won't see any made for TV dinners here - it's truly an authentic steakhouse with an upscale dining room. For the wine lover, Master sommelier Kevin Vogt will work with the chef to perfectly pair wine with each course. What is special, as of my last visit, is The Delmonico Steakhouse runs independent of the other food services at The Venitian. This means they shop for their own food and manage their own wine collection. So if you enjoy fine wine, perfectly paired with your meal - this is the place for you. \n\nThis is my #1 all time favorite restaurant. The food is good enough to stand on its own, and because of the special treatment you get at the kitchen table, I've yet to experience anything so great.\n\nHow much? You'll be shocked and surprised to learn this dining experience isn't terribly expensive. For a little more than you'd spend in the dining room, you get a personal dining experience, about $85 for dinner and wine pairing for about $65.\n\nI call this a once in a lifetime experience, even though I've been lucky enough to do it about ten times.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	gMRC8TWaGRY1xbPAAKL6oA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Mp65doMbJ4H2O81ewpQ3_g	5	2010-03-08 00:00:00	Never get between a girl and her BONE-IN RIBEYE....NEVER!\n\nWhen deciding on restaurant for my friend's BIG 3-OH B-Day dinner, it was between CUT, N9NE, and Delmonico's. After YELPING and looking over all the menus, Delmonico's was the winner because it was conveniently located in The Venetian (we were staying at the Palazzo), decently priced compared to CUT, and had rave reviews about the bone-in ribeye. \n\nRESERVATIONS: \nMaking reservations was quick and simple. You can make reservations directly through the restaurant as opposed to The Wynn Restaurants where you have to call their restaurant hotline number and the wait is 20+ minutes.\n\nOn Friday, March 4, 2010, our party of 9 arrived around 7:15 PM. As we were escorted to our table, we couldn't help but notice the shape of our table. A round table was connected to a rectangular table which errr, resembled a male part. Don't know if it was intentional since I told them it was my male's friend's b-day party? Anyhow, it made for a good laugh. \n\nFOOD:\n*Lobster Bisque ($12.50): Rich, velvety smooth with generous chunks of sweet tender lobster equals YUMMYNESS! The only complaint is it was a bit too salty for my taste. Four of my friends also had the bisque and complained about the same thing.\n\n*16 oz Bone-in Ribeye ($52): One word...WOW! The bone-in ribeye, aged for 8 weeks was one the most flavorful steaks I've ever tasted! The ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare with nice charred crust and a pink center. You can tell that the marbling slowly melted and basted the meat during the cooking process producing a rich, amazingly tender, and savory cut of meat. Aside from the Kobe from Craftsteak, this is hands-down the best steak ever; and for the price point, you really can't go wrong. If there weren't anyone watching, I would have literally grabbed the ribeye by the bone and gone to town cave-man style--it was THAT good!\n\n*Creamed Spinach ($9): DELISH! The spinach was extremely fresh and maintained a vibrant green in the velvety and savory sauce. It was well-seasoned w/o being too salty and complemented the steak perfectly. \n\n*Creamed Corn Gratinee ($9): OMG good--it tasted like a mac & cheese made with corn. The creamed corn was sweet and tender and was topped with a panko breadcrumb crust which gave a nice crunch to the dish. It was an explosion of flavor and texture combos in your mouth...sweet, savory, buttery, and crunchy.\n\nSERVICE:\nImpeccable service, although a little pretentious at times. I guess you would expect nothing less from an upscale restaurant like Delmonico's. When it came down to serving our entrees, it was like a symphony as the waiters/waitresses served our dishes in-synch with one another to create a "ta-daa" moment.\n\nI would have given Delmonico's a 4.5 star rating, however, they allowed Freed's to deliver a b-day cake and didn't charge a slicing fee.\n\nAMBIANCE/DÉCOR: \nNormally steakhouses have a very "dark" ambiance. However, Delmonico's was the complete opposite. It was well-lit with Ivory walls and ceilings with accent cobblestone walls, crisp white linens and chestnut furniture created a very simple, yet elegant feel.\n\nI'm ALL about splurging when on vacation. Go big OR go home right? And, when you're in Vegas, you definitely have to go BIG--so, what are you waiting for? Go on and get your Bone-In Ribeye ON!	11	8	9	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

MQjZjpGdSMv6Wpr1CeOSaQ	3	2008-05-04 00:00:00	Went there with co-workers because one of them had a craving for steak. We should've gone to just a whatever steakhouse that you could have for less than $20.\n\nTheir bone-in steak ran about $48. Their appetizer salad special of the day (which I had as an entree) was $20. Don't believe what the vegas tourist book says. It said it's "$$", where in actuality was more like "$$$$". I don't think I'd go there again. My friend said his lobster bisque soup was just "okay" and not as good as another, less expensive place. He said it was bland and not much flavor to it. Their twice-baked potato was pretty good, but I can imagine how unhealthy it is for you. \n\nTheir setting is nice though - dimly lit in some parts of the restaurant. Great for couples or dates. And if you want to go there, make sure it's something special like a birthday or anniversary. That's probably the only time I'd go back IF I ever went back.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	LNJ3FcYgZc5way0UtOt5eA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
mrsFsNXXUbCip4G1Lt_otQ	2	2016-11-02 00:00:00	Celebrating a friend's birthday last night November 1st everything started out well with our server Drew it went downhill from there when we were asked to move our table in the middle of a eating our appetizers for a party of four boisterous drunk men. when I say move I mean they literally asked our party of 4 to get up moved our table near the wall and pushed two smaller tables together for the party of 4 men. The Apex and Sema Convention were on town so the restaurant was packed. I had a ribeye steak which was good however the baked potato I ordered was cold along with our other sides. I will give credit to the manager who did remove the sides from our bill.  The bone marrow toast did not taste like it had any bone marrow at all and the BBQ shrimp was just ok.    I was very disappointed especially after spending  $388\n  I wasn't aware the convention was in town or we definitely would have come another night. when your spending that much money on a steak I think the service and meal should be outstanding	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	_TyeLQ9o6Bid1Jk95MyrZg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The seating was very prompt, they pull out your chair and place your napkin on your lap.. very fancy. \n\nThe bread is like a hollow croissant roll which is delicious! They bring one at a time but it's unlimited. The butter comes on a design on a small plate.\n\nOur drinks were tasty, came quickly.\n\nFor an appetizer we got the king crab deviled eggs. They were good... nothing too special honestly.\n\nEntrees were the rib eye and filet and shareable sides were the mushrooms and gratin potatoes. Steaks were cooked to perfection, mushrooms were amazing. Potatoes tasted like plain scalloped potatoes, could've used more seasoning and cheese.\n\nDessert was pecan pie with caramel and vanilla ice cream.. amazing. \n\nThe service was great, our waters were never once empty, plates always cleared and food came out quickly.\n\nOver all it was a great date and experience. I would highly recommend if you haven't been. Being out of state we probably wouldn't go back because there are hundreds of other places for us to try first and we don't go to Vegas that often.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	wG630MjP1h8cJY-w8rk3ZQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

mZyhlQxyIPuJJz5MGwkkTQ	4	2009-09-22 00:00:00	As I have been to the Emeril Delmonico restaurant in New Orleans and enjoyed it immensely, I decided to have dinner at the Delmonico Steakhouse located in the Venetian Resort Hotel & Casino where I was attending the Phantom of the Opera later that evening (incredible show by the way!).  What you'll find is a variety of food selections with Creole influences. \n\nFirst the menu prices are expensive ($$$$) but you are there for the intimate and fine dining experience and should be expecting to pay those prices.  What I didn't expect was to be dressed up and have an individual in shorts, sandals, and a Baltimore Colts jersey seated at an adjacent table to me.  Kind of lowered my view of this establishment being world class if you know what I mean.\n\nI started with the Lobster Bisque which was just superb but did lack the "Creole" twist I was expecting (The BAM factor).  Only thing that was a little of an inconvenience was the lobster pieces were quite large and were hard to cut with my spoon.  The wife selected the Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad Creole Spiced Croutons, Sherry Vinaigrette, Shaved Manchego Cheese Roasted Teardrop Tomatoes and Shaved Red Onion.  I had a taste and it was very good.  The different flavors were unique and distinctive.\n\nThe main course I selected a Pinot Noir wine that to go along with my Ribeye Steak and selected the Roasted Fingerling Potatoes and Whole Garlic with Fresh Herbs.  The wine was fantastic with a rich and bold body and floral aroma.  Wasn't dry and complimented the Ribeye Steak very well.  The Ribeye has Emeril's classic touch written all over it with the blackened spice rub with a pat of herb butter on top.  The cut was 1-1/2 inches thick, lean, and very large portion.  The potato dish was okay, didn't impress me in any way.  The wife also had the Pinot Noir and selected the Filet Mignon.  The cut had to be nearly 2 inches thick, lean, and a normal portion size.  I recommend selecting your Ribeye to be cooked medium rare (I do not recommend medium) and your Filet Mignon medium rare or at the most medium.  \n\nSorry to say we were extremely full when we finished and couldn't partake of dessert.  The meal described above with tip was roughly $210.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	eQB6K65YTZdEa8uxsF83VQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
M_a9DTvu_V0k8QIP-EvQlg	5	2016-08-01 00:00:00	We were invited to dinner here as part of a work office getaway in LV. Prior to arrival, I had whisked thru the menu as well as some reviews. I was actually expecting to be disappointed. I assumed that the prices might sway the opinions of many.\n\nMan, was I wrong. We walked in to this modern but simply decorated establishment on time and our party of 11 were immediately seated. Michael was our head server and he made sure we received water, a wine list and our menus.\n\nI had noticed that a summer trio for $65 was available so that is the angle I decided to take. I felt a little guilty that our employer was eating this tab so I wanted to be fair. I ordered the Mini Wedge, the Petite Rib-Eye and a Caramel Butter Cake a la mode. Most went this route although some selected the STRIP. You think Vegas had something to do with that?\n\nMy salad was good but I thought the Bleu Cheese on the plate was a bit understated. I do like Bleu Cheese with some POP. My Rib-Eye was called petite but it was still a plentiful portion. It was prepared PERFECTLY and the Chimichurri applied on top had the old taste buds doing somersaults.  \n\nThe dessert which is offered by itself was upgraded with a scoop of ice cream with Michael's recommendation. His idea was spot on. All in all, everyone enjoyed their FABULOUS meals. We laughed, conversed and immersed ourselves in each other. We definitely had a relaxing dinner. \n\nThe evening would not have been as grand without the service we received. Michael and his staff performed impeccably. The service was orchestrated and attentive. Make sure to stroll in one evening and ask if Michael can take care of you. You will not regret it.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	dznAAucTseAmHm7_KHnGkw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
N0r5ftyWaBftT-mGt2v0zA	2	2014-10-05 00:00:00	Nice place. Good steaks, delicious sides, good service. A bit overpriced, but not bad for Vegas. The only problem was with my salad. The egg was overcooked, and when I asked for another, they didn't bring a new salad, just a new egg, which turned out to be overcooked as well. I gave up and started eating the salad anyway, and when I pulled out a long dark curly hair, I stopped. They took the salad away, and three people apologized, but they didn't offer me another appetizer. They did make up for the unconvinced by comping our corkage, dessert, and, of course, the salad. It was a nice way to make up, but we didn't find out about that until the end of the meal.	0	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	qIfG6P1QZx4_dHBMNyNCNQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Researched a lot of steakhouses and thought this was reasonably priced (compared to others) for Vegas so thought we'd give it a shot. made reservations but was not crowded on a Monday night. We split the bbq shrimp which were very good for an appetizer. Then we each had salads. I ordered the filet mignon which was a small 6oz serving for $50. I could've easily eaten 2 of them. But the steak was very tender and nicely seasoned. Husband had the bone in ribeye which is what they are known for. He enjoyed it. We split the mashed potatoes which were very good, but kinda hard to screw those up. We each had 1 drink and the bill was $200. Service was good. They give you nice warm rolls which were tasty. We would go back, but we like trying new places and it will probably be a few years before we go back to Vegas anyways.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	CEtidlXNyQzgJSdF1ubPFw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We ordered an assortment of appetizers to share.  Butternut squash ravioli, truffle chips (weird to order potato chips at a nice restaurant, but we did not based on waitress recommendation) and shrimp were wonderful, the pork not so much....it was very mushy and gamy tasting for some reason. I don't consider myself a food snob, but I took one bite and did not eat any more.  \n\nWe booked this place based on yelp reviews and now I can see why they are mixed.  I would for sure give this place another shot if we were in Las Vegas AND in the Venetian/Palazzo area.  That said, I would not go out of my way to dine here again.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	q0wV_TIU2d7SQo2ck0onvA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The petite rib-eye with bacon wrapped shrimp, garlic mashed potatoes with a sweet tomato reduction was more than excellent! The appetizer of ahi tuna and salmon tar tar was very tasty as well. My husband had told them that we were celebrating my birthday prior to our arrival. They didn't make a big fuss, but greeted us with a yummy mini-mushroom tart to start our meal and ended it with a creamy cheese cake and wished me a happy birthday in a very descrete way :-)  -- I'm not one for loud signing and being the center of attention.

No one took are drink order for over 15 minutes even though the restaurant was only half full on a Thursday night - many people who were seated after us were already having their second drink and getting their appetizers.  Eventually after trying to get the waiters attention as he repeatedly walked by I ended up just having to get up and walk across the restaurant to have some one take our order which led to a waiter taking our drink and food order in a couple minutes....  But even then the service was lackluster and not a bit apologetic about the wait.  If you are spending $300 for dinner for two you expect decent service.  This place was a big fail.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	fFf4IR39UYbwc8nIg9ffNQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

nc6cy9ayrSiZl1uTy5IuFA	4	2013-12-17 00:00:00	One of my favorite dishes is Rack of Lamb.  When I'm traveling for work and see it on the menu, I have to try it.  My bar of measure is Mr. B's in New Orleans French Quarter part of the Brennan family.  Short of flying to Paris to find a fair place to compete against Mr. B's grilled lamb chops, Delmonico's certainly gave Mr. B's a run for its money.\n\nI tried Delmonico's without looking at yelp first - in some countries I would be shot for this crime - and not knowing that Delmonico's even existed.  It was after a long day of work and simply being hungry, I walked into the first restaurant that was open without even looking at the menu.  When I was seated and handed the wine list, I knew I had found the right place, almost by divine inspiration.\n\nThe wine list was more like a wine book, only dedicating the last page to single glass selections.  The rest were bottles only.  This is where I figured out I was in a place worthy of my pallet.  They had 15 different vintages of Caymus Special Reserve.  Most fine dining places maybe have one or two at most.  Of course since the company was paying and no one to split a bottle, I could not in good conscious order a bottle.  I would have been hung by the accounting department.\n\nThe waiter gave the specials of the day and I of coursed b-lined for the lamb chops like a rabid dog.  When the dish arrived you could smell the fine attention to detail that the chef had prepared.  The Colorado rack of lamb with Roasted Cipollini Onions, Haricot Vert and Brandy Peppercorn Reduction staring back at me was love at first sight. \n\nI order my rack of lamb medium rare. Anything else would be blasphemous to the animal who sacrificed itself for my dining pleasure.  The lamb was tender and juicy all the way through.  The vegetables, especially the Cipollini onions soaked in the tender juices of the lamb melted in my mouth.  This was a meal that reminded me why it's so good to be alive.\n\nMy only regret and no fault to Delomico's is I broke and tried the bread pudding for desert.  Being an Emeril restaurant I figured why not.  Being a bread pudding connoisseur and having such a spectacular experience with the lamb, I had high expectations.  I will be fair and say I was offered the key lime pie instead but I stayed true to course and ordered the bread pudding.\n\nWas it bad? No but it was certainly average for the area and if placed in New Orleans, it wouldn't even register on the map.  Delmonico's is marketed as "creole" restaurant and as such looses a star for the poor attempt on their bread pudding.  \n\nWill I be back? Absolutely without a doubt! Will I be ordering the bread pudding? No and if have a hankering for bread pudding after your meal at Delmonico's, mosey yourself on down to Gordon Ramsey's Pub and Grill.  Order the spotted dog and you will be in bread pudding heaven.  With that said, Delmoico's is in my top three restaurants of all time in Las Vegas.  If you don't mind spending a pretty penny on dinner and you're a true fan of food, Delmonico's is hands down one of the finest restaurants in Las Vegas.	3	2	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	xBvDrnp8Kl45aXkuRTeRvA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
NcKaR7-IohWKQGTQDDy6TA	4	2008-05-04 00:00:00	This is my 2nd Emeril restaurant experience, first is NOLA and I loved it.  It's only getting 4 stars because my lobster was a little too salty.  BUT, the preparation of it has been the best that I have ever had. It was so tender and succulent.  I would definitely order it again, but would remind them to please not salt it so much.  Everything that I ate that night was to perfection.  The salad, the appetizer, filet mignon and lobster.  Our server was also very nice and very on top of servicing our every needs.  The wine that he recommended paired extremely well with our meal.  \n\nYes, the walls are cream colored.  But it's a very clean, fresh feel.  The table are nice and roomy.  The chairs are so big and comfortable, you can sit there for hours enjoying your meal and drinks.  The accent colors in there are a tuscan red, so imagine a nice warm, bright feel.  I really enjoyed it.  Plus it's Vegas, who doesn't hit the lounge or clubs afterwards for the dark, moody ambiance.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ggtwHX4GVBY1J7TAVlqvuw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
NClAnISF3LVBiTszMRiKrA	5	2007-11-08 00:00:00	After my first bite into a DelMonico's medium-rare filet, the taste indelibly etched itself into my memory. So much so, in fact, that I dreamt about the steak the following day. \n\nIs the drool obvious?\n\nI could eat this steak every day. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I would bow down to the cow that produced this steak.\n\nAs you can see, I'm offering a ringing endorsement for this Emeril-owned establishment. It is, hands down, the best steak I've ever had. They cook the meat to perfection, slightly bloody, just the way I like it, and crusted with a seasoning that offers just enough taste to add flavor to the steak, but not to take away from the meaty perfection.\n\nBesides the steak, the cheese fondue with mini-pretzels is unbelievably creamy and delicious. I could drink it.\n\nDelMonico's isn't cheap, but hell, this is Vegas. You're supposed to indulge, and this is a great place to do it. \n\nI'm really surprised at some of the negative reviews from other Yelpers, but all I can say is, I've been here three times, and the steak is still oh-so-close to my heart (and even closer to my stomach). \n\nReservations must be made significantly in advance. And don't be surprised when the bill comes-like i said, it's not cheap. But the service is amazing and totally attentive, and the food speaks for itself. It's in the posh Venetian (by far one of my favorite hotels in Sin City), so you want to dress to impress and sip top shelf martinis. Yum. I wish I were there right now. Where's my steak knife, dammit?	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	j3hyELLtfNyxWAkGPN1Reg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
nCqdz-NW64KazpxqnDr0sQ	1	2015-06-26 00:00:00	I mainly went for the ceasar salad prepared tableside.  I ate in the bar, the bartender was very nice and helpful.  I got the grilled cheese with tomato soup.  Grilled cheese was very good but the soup was nothing special.  Now the salad that i read one reviewer said the best in vegas, which is the only reason i came.  Knowing that they put anchovies in it when they prepare tableside, i was going to tell them to hold off on that once they get started.  So as im waiting for them to come up and make it, they bring it already prepared.  What is that?  The whole point of getting it is to watch it being done and see that its made fresh.  So obviously the anchovies were already in it, and since i explained i didnt want them, they made another.   I was told its a fire hazard to prepare it in the bar area so they made it on the side when i wasnt looking.  The few bites i took werent that good.  So i watch them make the 2nd salad in the hallway.  Needless to say, it was totally flavorless, ive had better dressing from newmans own, and the lettuce was in long stems, not even cut up. I was very disappointed with the salad, although the other food looked good	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	0XVzm4kVIAaH4eQAxWbhvw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
ndYpjttFsZErShaqFUfR-g	2	2012-08-23 00:00:00	Went to Vegas with the husband to celebrate our 10 year anniversary and take that honeymoon that had been postponed for far too long.  One of the reasons we booked at the Venetian was to dine at Delmonico Steakhouse.\n\nWe originally made a reservation for lunch on Sunday but moved it to dinner as the husband was worried lunch service didn't offer all the varieties of steak.  Made the mistake of booking for 9 pm on Monday, August 20th.  The hotel was packed with a new rush of guests as was the restaurant.\n\nEnjoyed a drink in the bar before being seated and were then led to a small table where we were introduced to Josh, our primary server.  Josh informed us that we would have 3 servers that evening one of which would be a sommelier.  \n\nWe perused the wine list and then Lamont came over and asked "if anyone had explained the menu" to us - a jarring question in a fine dining establishment.  We decided to start with wine by the glass as we didn't want a full bottle at that point.  I asked Lamont about a blend on the list -- I inquired as to what was in the blend.  He asked me what I meant.  I clarified by saying what types of wines are used to make the blend.  He rattled off one variety and then said "and I think a Cabernet is in there".  Lamont made no offer to explain or recommend any other wines.  We ordered two glasses of Malbec, our appetizer and entrees.  My husband asked Lamont if he could get a side of garlic butter.  Lamont said no - they don't have garlic butter.  Really?!  This is an Emeril Lagasse restaurant!  He asked for a side of plain butter and we sent Lamont on his way.  \n\nA food runner, or possibly our third server (he never introduced himself), delivered a complimentary appetizer of tuna atop a crostini which I enjoyed but the husband did not.\n\nJosh came back with our wines.  We inquired as to whether Lamont was the sommelier that Josh had mentioned earlier and he affirmed that he was.  We expressed our surprise and disbelief yet Josh did not follow up with any inquiry as to why we asked the question.  At this point I had to talk my husband out of storming out of the restaurant.  Josh did not alert the floor manager of our question or our discontent.  It is unclear if this was because of poor training or due to the staff not being able to handle when the restaurant is full.\n\nOur salad with arugula, granny smith apples, prosciutto and champagne vinaigrette arrived and was very tasty.  We started to move past the negativity and then waited and waited for our entrees.  The husband ordered another glass of Malbec and asked for more bread, which never came.  The steaks were quite good but the extra butter was not delivered.  The twice baked potato was yummy and the side of mushrooms was divine.  \n\nThe espresso creme brulee and pecan pie desserts were very good and we appreciated the complimentary banana gelato with 'Happy Anniversary" written in chocolate on the plate but it still wasn't enough to make up for the fact that our servers' poor performance ruined an experience we looked forward to for months.  I would have given Delmonico Steakhouse one star due to the service but gave it two because of the food.  We expected much more.  I suggest you go somewhere else.\n\nFYI - Delmonico Steakhouse is a large restaurant that seats approximately 100 patrons.  The women's restroom has 2 stalls.	3	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	l5cCSzFEQZETF4wDtdsMbw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Neno9CBtwZWJKP92OquU3Q	4	2012-07-24 00:00:00	Every Vegas trip needs a fancy dinner. Delmonico just happened to be the restaurant this time around. I've never eaten steak in Vegas before (unless you count the $5 steak and egg places which I don't) so now was the time.\n\nAlas, I ordered the bbq salmon and I'm glad I did because it was delicious. Perfectly cooked and the potatoes on the side were delectable.\n\nI tasted my friend's steak which I had no complaints with. It just wasn't anything special. I'm pretty sure I could have made the same steak for cheaper. \n\nHowever, since California is banning foie gras, we ordered that with the steak and boy was that fattened duck liver good on top of it.\n\nFour stars because service was excellent and very friendly and my salmon was fantastic.	2	1	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	enNgSlVFfjDtegqVsVUYKw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
nENVkNxj5hMwi3vfm2Rymg	5	2013-10-11 00:00:00	Impeccable service, amazing food, & super easy accessibility when staying at The Palazzo means 5 stars all the way in my book.\n\nBut the FOOOOOOD alone deserves 5 stars:\n\nTuna & Salmon Tartare - very fresh tuna & salmon tartare, each delicately seasoned, with a bit of wasabi sauce & seaweed salad in between.  A lightly dressed cucumber and red onion salad with the tiniest seasame seeds sprinkled on top added a nice vinegary element.  And crunchy wonton chips were perfect to scoop up everything with.  Great texture & flavor!\n\nBone In Ribeye - a seared perfectly, served medium rare, herb butter topped, giant steak.  Classic.  Awesome.\n\nApplewood Smoked Double Cut Kurobuta Ham Chop - I'm not a big fan of pork so if I say that I loved this, it's a BIG deal.  This double cut chop had seared, caramelized, fatty edges, and was perfectly seasoned.  This was THE juiciest pork chop I've ever had.  Served with pecan-topped, candied sweet potatoes that are a MUST eat with the chop, & a cider reduction.  The combination of savory, sweet, buttery, meaty, pecan-y, brown sugary, and slightly hammy flavors together were amazing.  Emeril knows his pork!\n\nWild Mushrooms - a generous mess of delicious mixed mushrooms.  Yes.\n\nBanana Cream Pie - a ridiculously impressive-looking presentation, crazy tall!  Thin & slightly salty crispy graham crust, tons of freshly sliced bananas, able to reach such heights because the pudding was more cheesecake-y texture & acted as banana mortar.  Topped with fresh whipped cream, a drizzle of caramel, & a few chocolate shavings.  You'd have to be crazy to attempt to eat this alone!\n\nThis was definitely a dinner to remember, and that ham chop is something to spread the word about.  Get it!	13	6	9	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	SIZOfo7jTjCXnL8ZtpM2aw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
nfINDaGkk_NXZX4UGtAkvg	5	2013-04-11 00:00:00	My experience is from dining at the bar. I never discount the bar as an option for a wonderful evening. It honestly is the best way for a single diner or even two people to enjoy a nice evening without the pretense of an uppity experience.\n\nMy friend and I came to Delmonico, dressed in tank tops and jeans, so we found an open spot up front. The bartenders are friendly and just as polished as any server. The recommendations for red pairing with our bone in ribeye to the port at the end was perfection. We started our meal off with the steak tartare. It has to be the second best in the city. I wished they would use a quail egg to dress it instead of a chicken's. Moving on to our entree, we split the ribeye and it was more than enough for the both of us. Add a side of the haricot vert with sauteed shallots and it is the perfect meal. Being in an Emeril restaurant we we had to finish with one of his specialty desserts. I tend to not be a big pie fan, so we went with the bread pudding. It is decadent and comes in a generous portion. No one person should be able to polish one off on their own. \n\nThis is one of those restaurants were I would not even bother with getting a table and would prefer to eat out at the bar.	6	1	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
NgCqnVG105Zk-B19idNSqA	3	2013-01-27 00:00:00	The food here is pretty good but the reason I'm giving 3 stars is because I personally don't think it's any better than a Ruth's Chris, which is half the cost.\n\nWhat stood out the most was the lobster bisque. It was really good! But everything else wasn't better what I could have gotten at Ruth's Chris, especially not the banana cream pie which was worse.\n\nMy advice, save your money and go to Ruth's Chris or another restaurant.	2	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	iMhAQF57eo-HckQGTL0vnQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The sides are a la carte and big enough to share. I suggest having the chef's specials at least once. They are always changing and are so delicious. It is a bit pricy but that's Vegas. You pay for QUALITY! So make a reservation. You can use Open Table on line or through the app. If you go for a special occasion, let them know. They will always go out of their way to do something special.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	cRxbgvmhiFZcxaNwGCARqQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
nik4rM7-3oRMxSUwOgs3Ug	4	2013-12-17 00:00:00	At least 4.5 stars. Let me start by staying that I thought this was a great place. The ambiance was fantastic and maybe I enjoyed myself so much because we went here with a group of 18 or so right after my husband and I got married in the Venetian but here's the breakdown. \n\nThe appitizers were really great, the parmesan chips were thin and had wonderful flavor. We talked about stealing a basket as we left. The bbq shrimp was done perfectly and a great twist. \n\nMy brother had the soft shell crab and that may have been my favorite thing I had. It was fantastic but I don't have much comparison since that was actually the first time I've had soft shell crab. Nevertheless, it had great flavor and I would order it again. My husband and I split a steak and got the cesear salad. The salad was really nice and fresh. The steak was great, and probably in the top 3 I have ever had. \n\nWe had a bunch of wine and tried a few different kinds and they were all great. The manager came over and talked to us about the wines and was very informative and nice. \n\nThe reason why this didn't get 5 stars from me was because for the price, you just expect a little more from the steaks. This was still one of the best dinners I have ever had and I would absolutely go back.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3DvyCdzhr3PKbfK8QyRIoA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

NKHocDgLYJH4aj71S-y78g	4	2011-09-14 00:00:00	The service here is VERY mixed.  The first time I came (months ago), the host/hostess was NOWHERE to be found for like 10 minutes when I arrived for my party's reservation.  Then once someone was at the front desk, she totally ignored my existence and we stood there for another ten minutes.  Then some guy finally comes and I'm like I had reservations for so and so time and he is like I'm sorry, we just had a large party come in so there may be a bit of a wait.  \n\nOK?  That was a first.  I was expecting a little more attentiveness from a restaurant like this.  And it was kind off-putting to have had reservations at a restaurant of this calibre not honored.  We were told to wait in the bar area, where we were not even offered so much as a glass of water, and then ignored for another 15 minutes by the hostess until we decided to leave.\n\nTHE NEXT DAY, someone calls me and is like you missed your reservation last night.  Um NO, we were there and waited for about 45 minutes and left.  Then he was apologetic and offered to comp our dinner if we were to come back, but I was flying out that day and had to decline that offer.  Then he proceeded to ask for my address so that they could send a gift card.  I was like ok sure.\n\nI was surprised that the gift card was for as much as it was.  It was very generous of them.\n\nOn to the visit where I actually got to eat!\n\nThe mister and I came during lunch time on a Sunday.  Again, the hostess was nowhere to be found for the first 5 minutes or so.  Then she comes out and is like there is going to be a wait (I had reservations, yet again.)  So we sat at the bar, where the very attentive (and I guess new) bartender proceeded to hand us menus.  Then we were like ehh we'll just eat at the bar.  A couple minutes later, the hostess was finally like oh ok are you guys eating here?\n\nWe started with the Potato Chips with Truffle Oil and Parmesan MMMMM!!  For my entree, I had the Gulf Shrimp with fettucine and preserved lemon.  The shrimp was very juicy and fresh-tasting.  The bartender, who ended up being pretty much our server was very nice, attentive, and actually really fun to talk to.\n\nSo despite the initial situation, four stars for the delicious food, service at the bar, and the lengths the management went to make up for the mistake.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	tCS--RB5UQ5_4kdona4M1A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
NLAYj19ihrgBRgJvOBrqKw	5	2013-02-18 00:00:00	i had an amazing dinner here the other night with a friend.  In often too-busy Vegas, it's nice to find a nice, quiet, comfortable, spacious restaurant like this one, tucked in the Restaurant Row of the Venetian.\n\nThe food was very good -- I'd recommend the heirloom tomato salad and the lobster bisque.  The Filet was great as was the bone-in ribeye.  The wine list is amazing with a very nice collection of French wine, top burgundies in particular.  And if you're in the mood to drop $500-$750 on a bottle, you can actually great a very good value on wine that would cost much more elsewhere.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	fqCxaOI1cvnXx1OlHRUDPg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

noZs6hJQzxoQFNKuDCgTqg	4	2010-11-02 00:00:00	We stayed at the Palazzo and wanted to have a nice dinner at one of the restaurants in the hotel. I checked Yelp and found Delmonico had a really good review and made reservations for 9:30pm on Friday. The place was pretty full, with more and more guests still coming in.\n\nConsidering the price of the meal and the Yelp description we put on our "dressy" clothes. After we were seated a group of 6 came in wearing t-shirts, baseball caps, shorts, and flip flops. Oh well, that's Vegas for you.\n\nInstead of the usual bread basket, the wait staff would place a warm roll on your plate when needed. It was one of the best rolls I've had in a while. A warm soft roll with a sprinkle of salt on top. We ordered for an appetizer, the Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare Cucumber Salad and Wasabi Aioli. I thought it was a bit salty, but the bf thought otherwise. We still scarfed it down. Because it was a busy night, we did have to wait a bit between the appetizer and our entrees. But the wait staff was very attentive most other times. \n\nThe bf ordered the Filet Mignon. He said it was very tasty and melted in his mouth. I ordered the Roasted Rack of Colorado Lamb, Fresh Herb Popover and Black Truffle Reduction. By far the best lamb I have ever had. Previous times when I ordered lamb, it had a gamey taste. For a second, I thought I was eating filet mignon. The Black Truffle reduction has a nice addition. It did not cover up the taste of the lamb. The popover was light and airy and tasted of rosemary.  We shared the New Orleans Style Creamed Spinach as a side. It was rich, creamy and delicious. I didn't get to finish my cocktail by the end, so the waiter placed it in a "to-go" cup. The "to-go" cup being a hotel glass. \n\nIf I had the money to splurge again, I'd definitely go back.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	CpoKNJGz9d_3hz_SmidU4g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

nRcRia1RvIkSr3C1Lz_jtg	5	2012-09-27 00:00:00	On our first night's stay at The Venetian, we walked to Delmonico in less than 5 minutes and were seated on time.  It took approximately 60 seconds for the staff to begin delivering The Bliss.  I am not a steakhouse fan (my husband is), but this restaurant is an Emeril restaurant, and having had wonderful experiences at his other establishments in New Orleans, I thought we would be in for a treat.  The service was extraordinary even though the restaurant was hustling at by 8 p.m., we had the full attention of our waiter as well as the sommelier and other ancillary staff, which made the evening a lot of fun.  We enjoyed an amuse bouche of heirloom tomatoes, basil, burrata cheese and EVOO.  My husband ended up with an enormous piece of meat on his plate (no surprise there) that he stated emphatically was the best steak he'd ever had, accompanied by a terrine-sized dish of the New Orleans Creamed Spinach, easily the best creamed spinach I've ever put in my mouth.  I only wish I had been able to enjoy the leftovers in an omelette the next day for breakfast.\n\nI ordered one of the specials, which was a $42 plate of pasta.  Yes, you read right: a $42 plate of pasta.  It was heaven: just the right amount of papparadelle with six very large shrimp, and a generous amount of andouille sausage and artichoke hearts.  I enjoyed a complementary glass of red wine that was a blend of several varietals; complex and nicely balanced, it was a wine that Emeril endorsed and labeled, and it had been bottled by Au Bon Climat Winery in Santa Barbara, CA.  I started with the mixed greens salad, dressed with a sherry vinaigrette and shaved Manchego cheese.  It was perfectly balanced and just the right flavor profile for my mood that night.  We were too full for dessert, but had there been room, my money would have been on Emeril's Banana Cream Pie, served with caramel sauce, chocolate shavings and whipped cream. I didn't take pictures at Delmonico, but we enjoyed our food immensely and I would return in a heartbeat.  The staff is well-trained and extremely attentive, and the food is unpretentious, well-prepared and top-drawer.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	VkS1p3WZklEI5GbRZJPYZw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
nrd5fF6lirgivpY1ywwidA	4	2014-03-26 00:00:00	I had such a delicious dinner at this restaurant!! First it was the only restaurant that I could find on OpenTable that would accommodate a party of eight.   That was very helpful since we were all in Vegas for a race the next day.\n\nOur lead server, Tom, was spectacular!  He was truly helpful in giving us recommendations and extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  \n\nI got the barbecue shrimp which was phenomenal. The shrimp was done to perfection and the sauce was delicious. The biscuit was a little bit hard but not as important as everything else.  They also served popovers on the table instead of bread. The popovers were chewy and gummy and I would've preferred some other type of bread on the table. Maybe they're not fantastic at making bread. \n\nI got the special of a bone in filet mignon cooked rare. The rare was done perfectly! I was very impressed.  I also got the grits and the creamed corn for side dishes. Their grits were a little bit grainy for my taste although the flavor was good. The creamed corn was fabulous!\n\nOur table pretty much ordered one of every dessert. I ordered the banana cream pie based on a friend's recommendation. I have to say that was not my favorite but that's because I don't care for bananas in my dessert. My bad since I knew that. The banana cream pie was extremely dense with bananas. However I traded with another friend who got the pecan pie in the oatmeal cookie crust. Oh my gosh that was heaven!!  \n\nThe dinner was superb and the service was excellent! I would return here again in the future and I would recommend it to anyone visiting Vegas.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	oMRsIYkl75scsYPcamB45Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Even if you like foie gras pass on this one. It was heavily coated in honey and I didn't enjoy it.

I expect a lot from a top end steak house and was skeptical that Emeril's name and reputation might be trumped up, but several friends said we had to try his Delmonico steak house.  They were right. \n\nWe ordered the bone-in ribeye and the short ribs.  Both were easily the best examples of meat perfection we'd ever had - seasoned delicately and aged just right for an incredible buttery, nutty flavor that almost makes me think of buttered popcorn or butter toasted pecans. That delicate flavor was well paired with a bold garlic and cheese potato dish that we shared and a very nice bottle of Cain Concept from Napa Valley. \n\nThe staff were very helpful and accommodating - we asked for their names to request them again - we had a "team" including Tom Baker and Braden Guy, both gave expert advice and were supremely attentive without smothering us. \n\nTo top off the meal we had the pecan pie/tart topped with caramel and ice cream.

nvC2zrDdRx0E6dhIQpImJA	4	2008-05-06 00:00:00	I kinda view the steakhouse experience from several angles. Not just the price, but also the entrees and sides, the pairing with wine, the atmosphere waiting in line.\n\nI personally liked the atmosphere, as it was nice to have dim lighting for a late 9pm dinner. The waiting bar was nice, although the seats are very very low. A nice confidence booster for short folks, but some might find it uncomfortable. \n\nInside the restaurant, seats are very comfortable. Unlike my counterparts Don and Elmer, I ordered the standard NY bone-in steak. Very good, my only complaint was that it wasn't boneless! The wine was great; the waiter was helpful in selecting a bottle, very tasty but not too pricey for 4 near-thirtysomethings. The side dish of warm spinach salad(which yours truly ordered) was the showstealer of the night. Everyone liked it, so keep it on your radar if you go.\n \nOverall, I thought it was great. I gave it 4 stars, though it would really be 3 and a half stars. If you want a better selection of steaks, probably go to Ruth Chris, NERO or the Bradley Ogden restaurants. In Vegas, the benchmark is BOA, but BOA can get very very pricey. But for the value and overall celebrity restaurant experience, a good experience.

To start, the tuna and salmon tartare was amazing, along with a delicious cheese plate! We were pleasantly surprised most of the cheeses were from marin county, ca where we live and work! Two of us got salads, they were fresh and crisp and not over dressed. The steaks for our entrées were AMAZING.  I got the special which was a surf and turf filet mignons and shrimps, my coworker got the 100% Japanese wagyu and it MELTED the second it hit my tongue. The most delicious rib eye we have ever had! And for dessert we split a slice of key lime pie. Yum!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4eWuQQ8GJMUTgvWiJF9ebA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
NwjwjmqEFCwkaD20tmwlPA	5	2017-06-28 00:00:00	I wouldn't call myself fancy. I wouldn't call myself classy. I wouldn't call myself upscale.\nSo when I go restaurants that are fancy, classy and upscale I immediately feel like everyone in there can tell I don't belong. I don't know what fork is for what. I don't know where to put my napkin when I get up from the table and I swear everyone else notices. I also don't venture to fancy, classy and upscale places cause I almost always hate the food.\nThe fancier the words on the menu the less I wanna try it. \n\nThis is NOT that kind of place. Yes, it is fancy, classy and upscale. Yes the menu is a bunch of jibberish food. \nBut somehow I was still able to make out a few key words to order what was Caprese salad and Potato Soup.\nHOT DAYUM DUDE: Emeril is no joke.\nThe Caprese was so fresh. The tomato tasted like it was picked 15 minutes before it was cut and placed beautifully on my plate. The Potato soup had big chunks of bacon at the bottom and the server poured my soup over it. Then added a junk of Parmesan cheese and yuuum.\n\nIn other fancy, classy and upscale joints I feel uncomfortable to even speak to my serious server. Not this guy. Our server was casual yet still very serious about his job. He even cracked a smile a few times. \n\nI cannot rave enough about this place. It was beautiful and elegant, delicious and exciting flavors. I loved every second of Delmonico\n\nMy two small complaints\n1. The bathroom smells like wet rocks. Its has really cook huge rock walls but since its in a bathroom it smells weird. You know the smell of a dirty lake? That is the smell the bathroom had.\n2. This restaurant is inside the Venetian and VERY hard to find. There are no signs. None. Pointing you toward it. So from me to you: If you find the huge LOVE sign for the Beatles show it is directly to the right, almost hidden by the sign and the elevator.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	7XpdHptp6v70HKk4iBy5Wg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
NwwrPp43EDR7Ok_veujnEw	2	2013-01-17 00:00:00	I recently entertained clients here.  I made my reservation over Open Table.  Originally I had made for 4 people, then wanted to add one more guest.  They told me several times that there was no way they could fit another chair at the table.  Ok.\n\nWe get there, and there is a private party going on - but in the lobby/bar/wait area.  What?  That's a bit disturbing.  They sat us in the lounge area and we ordered drinks (which never came).  Then our "table" was ready.  Well this was the end table which basically was in the lounge area.  So we moved over one table. \n\nThe wine list is very in depth and almost overwhelming.  Just give me a good red with my meat is not the way to go here.  No simplicity.\n\nFrom the start our table was crowded.  Too many items on the tables, and the service ware was oversized for the little table.  It almost made it difficult to eat.\n\nBefore our food came I wondered off to the loo - which was like a hike because the restaurant is actually quite huge.  As I walked by tables, I saw several larger tables with less people seated at them and empty chairs.  Hmmm.  So they really couldn't let me bring an extra guest or they really don't know how to plan their seating?  \n\nDuring our meal we couldn't even talk - the noise from the private party was too much.  And they were standing all around us.  Several time people knocked into the back of my clients' chair!  So frustrating.  I can't understand WHY they would seat people in that area - and we had plenty of room for the extra guest.  \n\nThe food was wonderful.  Meat done right.  But all the negatives earn this only 2 stars.	2	2	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	FpHnc5Ok40acxiiHm4zWkw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The drinks were wonderful and they have a very nice wine selection.  The service was 'jonnie on the spot' with all levels of servers keeping a watchful eye on the table...perhaps too watchful!  Twice, as I looked around to check out the décor and the people, they came running over to assist.  Better to have false alarms then left waiting.\n\nIf the place has one issue, it's the atmosphere.  The design is plain white arched ceilings with rock wall and white light accents.  I respect how much they were able to achieve with just architecture and lights, but without the lights it might look a bit like a medieval dungeon.  \n\nAll things considered, the food and service were about as good as it gets so go check it out!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	D_MR0falcGODjMOZoS_W9w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

After having one of the best steaks of my life at Rosemary's the night before, I opted for some Peppered Ahi Steak. It was good, not great. It was lacking a little something. The wine was great. My husband had the grilled chicken which was very good. Overall, it was okay.

We brought a fine bordeaux for my birthday both times and were aware of the corkage policy. Wine spectator gives them the highest award and complements their corkage policy in fact. It took forever to get the bottle decanted and it really wasn't optimal and the meal was rushed. We even had cocktails  Snotty server, devil may care attitude. Sommelier? Or was he just the one who poured wine?  Not sure as he also offered food recommendations. Gumbo good, tomato soup and grill cheese ap okay but not fine. Avg cream spinach and dried baked potato. Partner had BBQ shrimp and was not overly impressed. Sadly the rib eye was only decent, but not out of this world. I was so looking forward to this night and it was a disappointment. Cavernous restaurant about 70 % filled on a Wednesday but the personal touch and care of a few years ago was gone.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Up4Jf93WZJJbnNYG99MHPA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The sides were very good (really loved the mushrooms) and leave room for the banana cream pie. \n\nGreat service, staff willing to help you with their extensive wine list and the bar served great drinks. \n\nI did think it was pricey though - there are many other excellent steak houses in Vegas so it' really doesn't stand out.

Tried the bone in rib eye had a decent char but very bland no salt or seasoning, filet mignon was the only good dish but lacked any presentation just a chunk of meat on an oversized plate, bbq shrimp appetizer sauce was flavorless, fried oyster were breaded too much and the green pistachio sauce tasted and looked like baby food, the truffle potatoe chips eere drowned in oil, banana pie also tasted plain. Overall lack of love in the cooking and I could find more flavor at a home town buffet. Maybe an off night but the service was good at least until the server realized I had a comp :o went from 100 to 0 real quick lmao.

Consider this the m80 of the meal exploding with flavor and a generous mound of Lobster.\n\nThe crab was good but nothing to oooh and aaaah over.  The steak was good too but I wasn't jumping up and down with excitement.  As for the side dishes...the gratin potatoes and the mushrooms were by far the best.  Our table tried almost all of them and those two would be the ones I would dive into.\n\nThe other guests felt everything was a little over seasoned.  I didn't get that but I am also borderline billy goat with my love of the salt.\n\nWhat gives this place 4 stars is the service.  The staff was awesome.\n\nLight the fuse of your tastebuds at this tasty steakhouse if you are craving an old school steak dinner with amazing service.	2	4	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	k0Rcr7X9w02tfxD1k-dlsQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

When we told my kids we were going back for my birthday, they got all excited. Their signature ribeye is lightly season and grilled to perfection anyway you like it. The service is impeccable. I love how everyone gets served at the exact same time. There were 9 of us so we ordered the majority of the sides and everyone got to try everything. By the way one of reasons well ALL love coming here is the truffle oil and parmesan cheese potato chips. If Lays ever made these, I'd be all over them. Normally I never order dessert at a restaurant, but I always do here. They have the best! My favorite this time was the churros! OMG these were the absolute best churros I've ever had!

I go to Vegas every Memorial Day weekend and every year I pick a different Vegas steakhouse for one of my dinners. Last year was Cut and I was EXTREMELY disappointed. Delmonico however was fabulous. I had the lettuce wedge salad and the filet oscar and both were absolutely delicious. My husband had the spinach frisee salad and the filet au poivre and he also really enjoyed them. The food, atmosphere, everything was just fabulous! The only thing to be aware of is that its VERY expensive-- the filet oscar was $70! But its Vegas and its Emeril and its a fantasic restaurant so its well worth it for a night out.

OaRMJKI6S7LAoa8xoEaqPg	2	2012-05-11 00:00:00	I feel like Twitter is pretty useless so far; I have an ok amount of followers I guess, but I feel like they're all following so many people that anything I say gets lost in the mess of their feed. I could tweet all day and get very little response to anything aside from a couple loyal folks on there. And it was one such reader that led me to Delmonico recently for what he claimed to be an excellent burger. He's a food writer in town so he should know what he's talking about, right?\n\nDelmonico is located in the small restaurant row of the Venetian right by another great burger spot, although most people would not come here for their burger. The interior is nothing too fancy in either the bar area or more traditional area in the back. I did notice while sitting at the bar that they have an amazing bourbon selection, but since I was there during a lunch break I'll have to go back some time when I'm not on the clock. The lunch and dinner menus are a bit different, with the lunch menu featuring more sandwiches and things, so maybe the comment I just made about people not coming for a burger is wrong. Either way, this restaurant is pretty fancy and features quite a number of great sounding items aside from what I came there for.\n\nThe Delmonico Prime Hamburger comes on a toasted brioche roll with fries, cheddar cheese and bacon. The meat had excellent flavor from the first bite, but I noticed right away that it was way overcooked and dry. It started off extremely juicy but that faded way too fast and by the end it was very dry. The cheese was melted and had great flavor, but the bun was a tiny bit dry as well and a little too thick. The heirloom tomatoes were fantastic, but maybe a bit off-putting at first due to their green color. The bacon also had good flavor, but was a tiny bit undercooked and soggy in parts. Overall it was still decent, but could have been well beyond that if the meat had been cooked properly.\n\nLuckily the fries were great. Some of them were almost a bit too hard and crunchy, but they were very tasty and a welcome change to the 'typical' fries I often get around town. Something I found to be quite funny was when I asked for ketchup I was brought an insanely large bowl of it, more than probably a table full of people could have used.\n\nThe online menu lists the burger at $15, so I was a little surprised to see the $18 listed on the menu when I made my order. I think if it was cooked properly I would still be ok with this price given the chef, the location, etc, but because of this price I seriously frown on the fact that they couldn't cook my burger properly. If you're willing to risk this inconsistency and are ok with the cost, I think it's a good burger to check out, and has the potential to be really great, but if you're at the Venetian and are craving a guaranteed good burger for a similar cost I suggest you go next door.	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We both got the bbq shrimp as the starter.  The shrimp didn't come out carmelized from being cooked on a bbq, it was served with bbq sauce.  They were good.   One of us got the little fillet and the other got the salmon entrees.  Both meals were great.  We were disappointed with the desserts.  The chocolate cake was hard.  The banana creme pie was also a little hard; appeared like it was layers of banana and cheesecake.  Not what I expected.  So, minus one star for the dessert.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AimNBjjD7Pg9ykWBT_pjjg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

oEz1Egsu2jvLjnBWAtZ9Ew	5	2014-05-07 00:00:00	There's a reason why Emeril Lagasse is such a celebrated chef. His restaurant, Delmonico Steakhouse, provided impeccable service and outstanding food.\n\nDelmonico Steakhouse was our big dinner out in Vegas for a bachelorette weekend. 9 of us were promptly seated for our 7:30pm Sunday reservation. I ordered a glass of malbec (my favorite, which is rather had to find).\n\nAs a table, we shared the BBQ shrimp (which was just the right hit of smokey and sweet), Truffle and Parm Potato Chips (uberly addictive) and the lettuce wedge salad.\n\nFor my entrée, I decided to get the Bone In Ribeye-the house specialty. It did not disappoint. It was quite a large piece of steak, but it didn't stop me from finishing all of it (that's not something I do very often). We split the creamed spinach and the creamed corn gratinee. The spinach was average but the creamed corn was vegetable candy. \n\nWe ended our meal with Emeril's infamous Banana Cream Pie. Holy moly. Sky high pie packed with bananas, caramel sauce, chocolate shavings, and whipped cream. Even though we were all full, we couldn't help but finish it.\n\nOur waiter was extremely attentive. Service, overall, was phenomenal. When our steaks were ready, there was a server for each plate so we were presented our dishes at the same exact moment. Now that's service.\n\nIt goes without saying that this was pricey, even for Vegas standards, but you get what you pay for. \n\nI highly recommend checking out Delmonico at least once.	1	2	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	y22jM83qCgsNGryv9328gQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Granted, I did order chicken (and I have yet to visit an upscale steakhouse who doesn't serve bland, dry chicken). \n\nWe came for thanksgiving dinner. There was a nice crowd... an older crowd. It's inside the Venetian. I ordered a loaded baked potato (or some potato dish) as a side. It looked beautiful and scrumptious but right after you get past the cheese and sour cream it's bland. I probably won't be back. But I can see why people like it.	1	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3VFoTrN88VE_J46n0ReCVg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The services is awesome, my friend dropped a spoon and before she could pick it up, she was handed a new one already. Then when dishes arrived, everyone got their plates at the exact same time. They had like 5 servers placing a dish in front of each person. We also got free crabcakes which was really nice of them. Now the food. Man yes it's expensive but SO WORTH IT! I mean you get a lot of food and the food is so freaking good. I have never tasted a ribeye steak greater than this one. It like melted in your mouth, even though meat isn't suppose to do that, I meant that it was so tender OH MY GOSH! I'm so going back next time I'm in Vegas. Their drinks are really good too.

Both were ordered medium and they both came out perfectly medium and mouthwateringly good! The sides were ok and the desserts were fantastic!\n\nThis is a great place to go for a birthday, anniversary or some special occasion. Although if you just have a hankering for a good steak on a Tuesday night, this place is good any time! Definitely make a reservation though because this place is packed!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	lOtsTqWOD2euZc3s-AsVng	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

My fish was eh, ok, but hey, it's a steakhouse.  What do you expect.  Everyone else raved about their steaks and the appetizers and sides were incredible.

I was very disappointed, the Fried Oyster appetizer dish was cold at the inside, the Creole Shrimps was also cold where these 2 dishes was suppose to be hot.  The Bone-in-Rib eye was fatty and the Pork Chop tasted like Barbecue Pork.

onICvCwxLI_c4Ut59Rc_sg	4	2009-06-16 00:00:00	A fancy steakhouse with minimal decor, Delmonico's was recommended as the best place for steak in Vegas by several people.  Everything was very tasty and well seasoned, but we didn't find the food to be spectacular as expected.  Not sure if it was all the alcohol we have been consuming the past 2 days, but none of us could finish out 16 ounce steak - which was a damn disgrace in our books.  Though overall the experience was good, we doubt we would return anytime soon because there are just so many other steakhouses in the city to try out.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	-ktdy3-UDLGS11frk7OlaQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Why oh why would you seat me in a dark, partitioned corner??\nThen my dirty martini came, and it was...warm. \nAnd my iceberg wedge salad was tasty, but soggy. \nMy bone-in ribeye was enormous and glorious, but not exactly warm. \nAnd my tawny port looked awfully ruby. \nAll in all my experience was uninspired.	1	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	b1ZHmH27QqxnNPk2sOJbZw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I finished the whole thing (no, not the bone also). It was a really delicious piece of meat. It was cooked medium rare perfectly. As if the steak wasn't rich enough for us... we decided to add on the seared foie gras. Very good piece of fat! For the sides, we ordered the corn, cream of spinach, broccoli and buttered asparagus. Much needed to counter the meat. \n\nService was excellent as you expect it to be. I really enjoyed this place and it is great for a fancy dinner one of your nights in Las Vegas.

We had the tiger shrimp with avocado and chicken gumbo as appetizers.  The shrimp was so good, super sweet and fresh.  Chicken gumbo was good too and I'm not even a gumbo type of person.   \nMy SO and I both had the Prime Burger as our main course, and wow the burger was huge!  My SO is a pretty big eater and he could only finish 2/3 of the burger.  I had half of mine left over, I desperately wanted to finish it though.  The burgers were very rich, meaty, and just everything that a good burger should be.  \nI didn't give this place a 4 star because of our short trip to vegas we couldn't go back to eat dinner, but we'll be back soon and hopefully I can give this place a 5 star.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	c0S3W2ziJGHxtdxjTUz5iA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We ended up getting Emeril's red wine blend, which was surprisingly good and $9. Not too bad for Vegas. We also got his bbq shrimp and gumbo. Both were really good. I loved the little biscuit that came with the shrimp. The sauce with the shrimp was a rich deep color with lots of flavor. Not your traditional BBQ shrimp. The gumbo wasn't spicey, but had a nice flavor. We also got complimentary "sweet" rolls (maybe yeast?) with our shrimp and gumbo. They were SOOO good!

oy55J-NlQG0Fk8DHXzxqQA	5	2012-05-14 00:00:00	This is my favorite restaurant in the United States, bar none.\n\nSome of the best service and atmosphere I've ever seen in a restaurant, anywhere. For example....\n\nA few days before one visit, I called to request that the Peanut Butter Cream Pie, a dessert special from a past trip, be once again on the desert menu. When we showed up for dinner, we didn't see the pie on the menu, but were informed that the chef had made and saved an ENTIRE pie just for our party. It was unbelievable.\n\nAnd oh the food....\n\n** Warning: this meal is a marathon. If you're not a big eater, don't be afraid to share appetizers, order smaller steaks, skip the rolls, etc so that you can room for all parts of this amazing, amazing meal.\n\n**** Appetizers ****\n-- Lobster bisque is the clear ungodly standout.\n-- All the salads are routinely excellent.\n-- Skip the tuna tartare and tomato soup -- they aren't as impressive.\n-- The free rolls are really, really excellent.\n\n**** Wine ****\n-- For those that (like me) enjoy wine but aren't connoisseurs, the Fisticuffs cabernet is my go-to. It goes great with all steaks at a reasonable ($55) price.\n\n**** Steak ****\n-- Ribeye is the obvious play, and is amazing (and huge), but the filet is outstanding for those who want something smaller and not quite as rich.\n-- Try Au Poivre style for really powerful flavor. Steak purists should do the ribeye straight up, but those who like peppery and lightly sweet flavors would love the filet au poivre.\n-- I am told that they serve entrees besides steak, but I have never, ever seen anyone be so misguided as to come here and fail to order a steak.\n\n**** Sides ****\n-- Usually we have one person order all the sides for the group, just to make sure we get a good mix of them so everyone can try everything. They're served family-style, and are big enough for ~3 people to have some.\n-- Twice baked potato (which has gratuitous amounts of cheese and bacon) is incredible, albeit heavy. Two can share, but my friends insist on ordering their own.\n-- Mushrooms are some of the best I've had, and go perfectly with the steak.\n-- Broccoli or asparagus is a good choice to contrast the rich steak.\n\n**** Desserts ****\n-- Oatmeal pecan pie is one of my favorite desserts anywhere. You will want a whole one yourself after one bite, so order accordingly.\n-- Banana cream pie is well known and hyped, for good reason. It is also enormous.\n-- Skip the bread pudding and peach cobblers -- they're good but not in the same league.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	y8akzsGLSn8rFvVOUW-EAQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

P0YCMXahrDRwgN9kwHu3Xw	4	2015-02-27 00:00:00	In town for business, had several great meals. However tonight I am eating alone and craving a nice piece of prime cut. I chose this restaurant based on rating and expected value. \n\nOrdered the bone-in prime ribeye, a signature dish, asparagus and a glass of house red. \n\nThe service was excellent for the entire meal. The table bread was good but in my opinion was really better suited for breakfast or needed gravy like Yorkshire pudding. The house red (a cab) was excellent, sorry forgot what I ordered, but it was the least expensive but was very good. \n\nWas served quickly, if I had clients with me I would hope for a little slower pace but alone the speed was appreciated. \n\nThe asparagus was perfect, not over cooked or smothered with too much butter, and very tender. The ribeye however came up very short, lacked taste and was tough, not what you would expect from aged prime ribeye. The waiter respond quickly and offered a new steak, I decided on the filet. I was served as fast as possible, the new steak rectified the problem, perfectly charbroiled, taste and texture as expected. Also served fresh asparagus. \n\nDessert, ordered the pecan tart and a cap. Both very good. The pecan very tasteful, the filling was not too runny or too sweet and the pecans were fresh with a deep southern taste. The crust was very favorable and went well with the Carmel and house made ice cream and whipping cream. \n\nOther notes, good lighting and I liked the architectural ceiling. Chairs are stylist and very comfortable. I recommend adjusting the traffic flow, two much weaving required and not ideal for guest seated in wrong location. Never like sitting near restroom entrance, which I was; as much as I like most people watching I would of asked to be moved if with clients or my spouse. Lastly white sugar cubes, really?	1	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	PZ366rvS9v2rJDINjA7d6g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

P6X2rCNxNdqskWizcylcKg	1	2014-08-03 00:00:00	UPDATE - \n\nDelmonico / Emeril's staff reached out to me via Yelp a couple of days after I posted the review, and I ended up having a good conversation with their Director of Operations in Las Vegas.  Mike told me he reviewed the events of the evening with the staff at Delmonico, including the mistakes that were made and ways to ensure it doesn't happen in the future.  He asked that I give them another chance and let him know when I'm going to be in Vegas again, which I most certainly will. \n\nI'm very impressed with their response and how they took the review as an opportunity to improve. \n\nORIGINAL REVIEW - \n\nOne of the worst high end Las Vegas restaurant experiences I've ever had.\n\nDinner started out alright.  Larger party of 15, restaurant spread us across 2 tables instead of handling us as one; acceptable, but not thrilling. Initial greeting with menus and wine lists was prompt and fast. \n\nAfter that, follow up service to get drink orders and appetizers was very slow. Orders were finally taken and again, return to deliver the drinks took a while. \n\nWhen time came to order, my wife and I were among the first in the group.  I ordered a tableside Caesar for 2, a Special bone in filet medium rare for my wife and a special bone in filet blue (think less cooked than rare, if you don't know it) for myself. \n\nThe pop-overs are fantastic, and the tableside Caesar was great. The gentleman who prepared it was kind enough to give me a couple of hints how they do the Caesar dressing which I'm looking forward to trying in my own Caesar dressing. \n\nAt this point, the wheels came off the bus. I finished my glass of wine with the Caesar and tried repeatedly to signal our waiter John for another glass and failed. My wife got into trying to get his attention as well and failed multiple times before finally succeeding. \n\nRough bus, meet out of control bus. Dinner arrives, and my wife and I are simultaneously served Bone In Ribeyes. Hers medium rare, mine blue (our order was Filets - medium rare and blue). We promptly object and are corrected at first by the waitstaff that we got what we ordered (we never order Ribeyes as we both like our steaks too rare for a ribeye's flavor to come out).\n\nThe waiter comes over after some confusion and tells me he brought me what I ordered. After some quick discussion our incorrect steaks are removed and we're told our Special of the evening, Bone In Filets, are on their way. \n\nNot minutes later, we're told they've sold out of the special and we can have regular filets. Since the rest of our group has already been eating we just say fine, whatever, bring us a medium rare and a blue filet. \n\nThree different people drop by to apologize to us, a total of 8 times across them. Frankly it creeped us out a bit. \n\nWhen our new steaks finally arrived, they sat them down saying "here is your medium and rare filets".  When we cut in to them, we did get 1 medium and 1 rare filet but 0 medium rare and 0 blue filets. We just accepted them and went forth. \n\n The flavor of the filets were good, as was the texture and seasoning. \n\nAfter the steak disaster, I did not have to struggle to get another glass of wine fortunately!!\n\nI can't say the side of grits with cheese and bacon was all that great since it sat there getting cold and congealing the whole time they were figuring out the steak issue. \n\nWe passed on dessert, having lost all confidence on the restaurant. We did order a decaf coffee and a 10 year tawny port for me. The waiter offered to buy the port for me, i.e. comp it, but that seems a small consolation compared to blowing the whole main course in such an epic fashion. \n\nCan't recommend you avoid Delmonico enough. With so many other options around here, don't risk wasting your hard earned dollar (or luckily won one) here.	4	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	cJJggI5N9gnb2L8bS5Obow	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

It takes around 20 minutes to prepare, so bring your patience with you....the beef that they use must come from heaven, because this burger is so tender juicy and flavorful.... I could eat another one right now... or maybe half... Thats about all I got through on this....  Its HUGE.....  its $18 bucks and I really didnt care at all when I paid because i felt like this was wellllll worth the money.....  and definitely order the Parmesan chips with truffle oil.... fantastic!!!	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	B6wnNghKgXmIrbn5k1pKBQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We had about half the sides and appetizers at the table and these were all great too.\n\nSadly, our steak came out way too raw.  We asked for medium and it was seriously raw inside.  Restaurant was great with the error though, even the manager came over to us and made sure we didn't want anything else or a new steak after we told our waiter we were ok and didn't really need a replacement (we were pretty full and were just going to split the original steak).  We were not charged for the steak.\n\nI would eat here again.	3	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Wu0bfCVa_SsMuhbemAuaIA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

pa4MASGD-2EFoR_rGDZILw	5	2010-03-25 00:00:00	"WOW!!!" that's what she said... literally! lol, actually that's what we all said after we took our first bite into the appetizer (bbq shrimp). Let me back track a little bit though. I made a reservation for four on open table... we were running a little late so I called and to let them know. They were very friendly and accommodating with our late arrival. As soon as we get there, they said "You must be Jason, party of 4 correct?" Very nice touch for a first impression. We were greeted by our main server, followed by the assistants. Our server made good conversation and awesome recommendations. We never felt bugged, rushed, or belittled (since we all look pretty young). Even with the huge wine list, we were scratching our heads and our server recommended a VERY good syrah that fitted within our budget.\n\nBetween the 4 of us, we ordered the bbq shrimp, filet mignons, lobster tail, and I ordered the rib eye. Seriously, every bite was WOW! Cooked to exactly the way you ask!!! You have to try it for yourself and you'll understand the WOW factor this restaurant has!\n\nWhile making my reservations, I noted that it was a special dinner for me and my wife, along with my friend and his wife (our anniversaries of dating). lol...anyways, when we were about to ask for our check, the staff came out with two bowls of fresh strawberry sherbert/sorbet with a candle in it, followed by the words "Happy Anniversary to you both and Thank You for coming to Delmonicos"! I wanted to stand and applaud! hahahah Our server then went on to take our digital camera's and take a couple pics of us.\n\nIf you're looking for a restaurant with that WOW factor (and you love meat), I highly recommend visiting Delmonico's.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	5aFBj0emFzoXsUcKbDQZiA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
padMoA48Uh7gLnXr3Bi7Ug	5	2011-06-27 00:00:00	Being a fan of the Food Network and chef Emeril Lagasse, my girlfriend (fiance the next day!) reserved us a dinner date to this place. I was excited but then again curious on why it was it was so expensive. They must serve some really good cow I thought!\n\nAnyways, the website said the dress code to be business casual/fine dining. We dressed up but saw a few people came in with shorts and a shirt. They seated us towards the side which was kinda of private from the crowd. It was romantic and our waiter was really nice since we asked for it.\n\nWe started off with a bottle of Cabernet. I don't remember if we had any appetizers or not. If we did, I didn't remember therefor it wasn't a "wow" factor. For the main course, I had the filet minion where as my fiance ordered the famous boned rib-eye. We also ordered some asparagus and gratin potatoes on the side which was excellent. My medium filet was cooked to perfection. When they brought out the rib-eye, we were like, "whoa!" It was huge... Once she digged in, she couldn't keep her knife off it. It was so juicy and delicious! I was actually eying her rib-eye the whole time. We actually swapped our dishes half way. She is generous like that. :). After being buzz off the wine, and bloated off the food, we finished it off with the creme brulee. It just hit the spot...\n\nThe check came out to be around $250. It was well worth it and I will definitely be coming back here in the future.	3	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	_wEHJQpRuxwkwmocKbfHUw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Eventually we needed to start our dinner 30 minutes later than we first anticipated. We knew this at least a month before the event, but they could not accommodate us and make the change, which seemed ridiculous ... a half hour later, come on?\n\nWe ended up having the dinner reception at Postrio instead. It couldn't have turned out better and they were very easy to work with. \n\nI've dined at both locations on separate occasions, and I have to say my food was better at Postrio both times.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	9spixZHaqC1JeN1ldfHK4A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I wasn't hungry (late lunch) so I had a (delicious) salad and wine, and he got a bourbon, the filet with creamed spinach and au gratin potatoes.  From the second we got there till we left they treated us like royaly.  Ross, the manager, came and chatted with us at our table, offering an appetizer on the house because of our big day.  They even plated my year-old wedding cake top tier, frozen for a year and in a bag for 6 hours on a plane from NY, and presented it to us with candles on a small table with plates and forks.  The filet, by the way, almost brought me to orgasm with a single bite.  Seriously.... no, seriously.  It was prob the best single bite of beef I've ever experienced.\nWhat else.... the year-old cake was surprisingly good! (I baked it myself) :)\nOf course it's a killer bill at meal's end ($135 for everything I mentioned above and nothing more) but worth every penny, y'all.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	erYd5tUaD5Yl_fZQpPcJrg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

pfaViSTImnnY2OEV5f31ag	5	2008-07-14 00:00:00	LAS VEGAS...i have so many unforgettable memories...\n\ni first came to this sin city on a cold winter night with my college roommates.  the youngest of us had just turned 21 and we needed to prove we were adults.  back then, new york new york was the hottest hotel on the strip and we went crazy, imitating diana ross and the supremes (i would say we were the original "dreamgirls" and i have pictures to prove it).  we couldn't afford a lobster for each person, so we shared 1 among 4 of us. we were young, naive, dirt poor and shameless.  \n\nsummer in vegas is a miserable time, and my sisters and i braved that heat by looking at the bellagio water fountain in awe.  that water show is still the favorite part of my trip every time i go to vegas.  of course, this all happened before "ocean's eleven" featured that famous last scene.  i don't think we looked as cool as brad and george though...\n\ni swore to myself that i'd never be back to this city after our incident at a club.  we got kicked out for having too much fun!!!  it was for a bachelorette party, and i think paris hilton was slightly jealous because we drew more crowd than her performance on that night.  we continued to party on in our suite and i discovered that night that jacuzzi could make even the most prude girl hot and steamy!!!\n\ni am no longer young nor have enough energy to party all night, but vegas proved to be a great place to have some of the finest dining experiences one can enjoy.  this time, our sole purpose of the trip was to eat at delmonico steakhouse, and what a fantastic night we had!!!\n\nsome of us had been here before, so the night started with the chef's complimentary appetizer which was a capane of smoke salmon on puff pastry.  a bottle of red wine was chosen from their extensive wine list along with fried calamari and barbecue shrimp as appetizers.  i can't make a comment on the wine, but the calamari had overwhelming amount of olives for my taste.  i did love the shrimp as they were cooked perfectly in that tangy sweet bbq sauce.\n\nsome of us were disappointed that the restaurant no longer offered pork chop, but the special of the night was pork tenderloin with braised bacon, and they happily opted for it.  a couple of us ordered a bone in filet, the bf ordered a bone in ribeye and i got a filet mignon.  my butterflied medium steak was perfectly charred outside with some pink inside and it was very tender and juicy.  i tasted the pork dish and i loved every part of it.  i never knew that a chunk of bacon could be so buttery and sweet, and the cane syrup they used to braise was just perfect for that white fatty meat.  the highlight of the night was the bone in ribeye.  that thing was huge with so much flavor!!!  i rarely eat any pink meat, but the bf's medium rare steak was so delicious i didn't care for the color of it.  seriously, if you ever get a chance to go to delmonico, get their bone in ribeye.  you'll thank me forever for the best steak ever!!!\n\nwe also ordered sauteed garlic mushroom and roasted fingerling potatoes.  it was a mushroom heaven with all different kinds of them (shiitake, button, oyster, portebello, etc) cooked in chopped garlic and the aroma itself could make someone's mouth watery.  those purple, yellow and red potatoes side dish was recommended by our maitre d' and it didn't disappoint us.  maybe it could be too heavy for a light eater with all that meat, but for a person like me (a meat & potato girl), i couldn't ask for a better meal.\n\ni must say this steakhouse is a place to impress someone.  it's a huge restaurant, but since it was sectioned into 3 different rooms, it rather felt intimate and quaint.  small tables were cornered so you could be private and although the restaurant was busy, i never felt rushed.  the waiters were not those friendly joker types, but the service we received was more than adequate and appropriate.  \n\ndelmonico renewed my faith in vegas.  i was impressed...i was happy...i was glad to be back to vegas where i have the good, the bad and the ugly memories of my "peak" time!  this dining experience (not just the food) tops as one of my favorite moments in vegas.	11	9	13	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	23_DfS0ojdNS-MFGF_SjsQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
pg1qgHTOmfZV2s_yqaKmsQ	5	2009-01-04 00:00:00	Absolutely loved everything about this place.  My party of 6 chose this establishment to have our New Year's Eve dinner and the restaurant did not disappoint.  We were 20 minutes late for our 8:30pm reservation since we were stuck trying to squeeze through the NYE crowd from 2 hotels down.  The host didn't think anything of it and was able to seat us right away.\n\nI had ordered the filet mignon and shared the side of the perfectly steamed and buttered asparagus that could serve up to 4 people.  I ordered my filet medium rare and it was definitely medium rare as our helpful and attentive waiter, Ryan, had described it.  The other dishes my dining companions had were the pepper-seared ahi tuna, grilled petite beef medallions, and spicy jumbo shrimp with fresh fettucine pasta.  All of which they loved.  \n\nThe dessert lovers shared the warm apple crisp and the chocolate brioche bread pudding.  It was the first chocolate bread pudding I had and once I dug into the soft center, I fell in love....\n\nAt the end of dinner, not having a calculator, Ryan noticed I was struggling a bit to calculate everyone's portion of the bill and he kindly offered to split the bill 6 ways as I had specified to make things easier.... How nice was that?!  Excellent food, excellent service - highly recommend dining here.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	PFLvbX6oXX5LB90G1W7Ddw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

PguageQLbgZPsnzSxfELEg	2	2011-11-29 00:00:00	Given the big name attached to this place (Emeril), and based on a friend's recommendation, I had high hopes. Sadly, the name here is just a facade for mediocre food and service.\n\nI made reservations via Yelp/OpenTable to treat my girl to a nice dinner on our first "just us" trip to Las Vegas.\n\nIt was a cold night and she had decided to wear a heavy coat. When we arrived, neither the host or hostess offered to take her coat. I then asked them to take her coat and they responded that Delmonico's doesn't offer a coat check. Strike one.\n\nThe hostess seated us at a table that had obviously already been reserved for us, as two of the chairs at the four-person table had been removed. That was a small, but nice touch.\n\nI had expected Delmonico's to have a dress code, but there were plenty of patrons in jeans and polo shirts. I almost want to strike the restaurant for that, but I understand it is Vegas and they have to cater to a variety of customers. But it does take the ambiance down a notch.\n\nThe waiter appeared promptly and introduced himself (Renee, I believe it was). I had to ask for the wine list. Why should I have to *ask* for the wine list? Strike two.\n\nRenee did not go over any of the specials with us. He also mentioned that two other servers would be assisting them, but he did so when they weren't there. So when one of them came by later, we had no idea which of the two assistants he was.\n\nThe assistant pretty much took over at that point, and we only saw Renee once again (with the bill). The assistant asked to take our order before we even saw the wine list.\n\nThis wasn't turning out to be the pampered, high-quality service that I had come to expect based on my experiences at other fine dining establishments.\n\nOur food came out fairly quickly; almost too quickly. We had barely received the wine when our appetizers arrived. She had the lobster bisque which was very thin and only contained about 1oz of lobster. I had the duck prosciutto flatbread. The duck was overcooked and still had a layer of skin and fat that was rubbery.\n\nAlmost instantly after we finished our appetizers, the main entrees arrived as if they had been waiting around the corner with the dishes to spring out as we took the last bites of our appetizers.\n\nShe ordered the filet and I had the bone-in rib-eye. Both of the cuts were of good quality but were ruined by an over-seasoning of creole spices. Both steaks were ordered medium rare and came out cooked perfectly.\n\nThe sides left much to be desired. Many of the choices were bland and uninspiring. The broccoli was simply steamed with no seasoning or oils added. The potato gratin contained too much garlic.\n\nThe speed of the service and delivery of the meal was too fast. We finished dinner within 1 hour. Strike three.\n\nTotal damage, including wine ($120 for the bottle) and tip, came to ~$340. We've had much, much better fine dining experiences (and food) for less.\n\nI would not recommend this place to anyone looking for a classy, upscale meal. It's just a touristy, over-priced restaurant with a celebrity chef's name tied to it.\n\nThere are many better options available in Vegas.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	aBMgdtHYfs3MnMz6tS32GA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Ph4Lm6Asfx9VuNSe-ISRhw	1	2010-04-06 00:00:00	Finally made me give up on Emeril's restaurants.  We were some of the first customers at Emeril's at Universal Studios here in Orlando, which was OUTSTANDING when it first opened and the first few visits after that.  Then it started going downhill - poor service and bad food.  It was so bad, we swore we wouldn't frequent any of Emeril's restaurants ever again.  Then we were in Vegas and at the Palazzo looking for a place to eat.  We foolishly decided to give Delmonico a try.  Worst service we've had in a long time.  The waiter acted like we were bothering him.  He disappeared after dropping the menus and wine list on our table.  When he finally showed back up and I ordered a glass of wine (he didn't offer drinks when he dropped the menus on the table), I didn't get it for a good 10 minutes.  If I had been by myself, I would have walked out, but my wife didn't want to do that.  Dinner showed up and we started to eat.  My glass of wine ran out, with absolutely no sign of our waiter.  I finally had to flag down another waiter to ask for my wine.  Truly pathetic.  Food-wise, I don't know where the other reviewers have been having their steaks, but I have no clue why they would say these are the best steaks they've ever had.  It was OK, but certainly not worth the price we paid (and, trust me, I don't mind spending money in a restaurant).	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	gUtj9uKGKEQvE3w0d5DX0Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We chose to go to Delmonico Steakhouse because when we first began dating our first real date was at Emeril's in Vegas.  We booked a reservation via open table for 5 pm, we arrived around 4:30 and was told they would begin seating at 5 and we could wait in their lounge area.\n\nOur servers were Ryan and Anthony and they did a spectacular job making us feel welcome and catering to our needs.\n\nI had the bone in Rib Eye and my wife ordered the Rack of Lamb both were dialectic and cooked how we ordered them. We also had the creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes.  The creamed spinach was very good.\n\nTo top it off because I had mentioned it being our anniversary on OpenTable when I booked the reservation we were surprised to receive a special little tasting to begin our dining experience and a scoup of their chocolate gellato for dessert.\n\nOverall it was a great evening to remember.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	m-kzKybwiWDhxQWzhXT-dQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

PJLBGBr2IU4rN4RTdEFH0w	4	2008-11-12 00:00:00	4.5 Stars \nDelmonico does not disappoint! \n\nI had the wonderful luck of visiting Delmonico for my birthday dinner in Vegas. I was beside myself with excitement to try an Emeril restaurant! \nPrior to our 8:30 reservation, we sat in the lounge to take pictures and have a drink. Our hostess came to get us when our table was ready. \nWe were greeted by our friendly waitress (her name escapes me) and were all seated quickly. She took our drink orders and delivered them quickly. She let me peruse the VAST wine list at my leisure and explained the specials of the evening and gave the market price of the items on the menu. \n\nI decided on the bone-in rib steak with broccoli and bacon cheddar grits. In the meantime, I ordered a bottle of Klinker Brick Zin and our EVER observant, and discreet waitress whispered in my ear to inquire on the preference on whether I would like her to present the bottle just to me or would I like her to present it to the rest of my drunk and (embarrassingly) rowdy guests. What a professional. I won't even get into how I handled the two of my 4 dinner partners and their TERRIBLE manners, but let's just say I won't be seeing them anymore. \n\nFinally, dinner arrived. My steak was beautiful. Well, cooked, not quite as rare as I had hoped, ah well. A rare steak seems to throw cooks, I don't get it. The sides were HUGE and beautiful. The broccoli was fresh and not over steamed so they still had a slight crunch to them. My bacon and cheddar grits were so rich and savory. I could only have a few bites of them before my stomach couldn't take anymore. Delmonico was nice enough to deliver chocolate ice cream at the end and wish me a happy birthday! What a lovely ending to a chaotic dinner! \n\nI hope to enjoy Delmonico again soon, and with better dinner partners!	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	-fQPzH-e-ubDIiLQhybEjQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

pm81cSZdMdymRGIN6HmLqA	2	2014-12-14 00:00:00	Let me start off by saying that I am a huge foodie LOVE all of Emerils restaurants. I started off by ordering the wilted spinach salad with bacon vinaigrette that was absolutely to die for that I ended up licking the plate. They also did a very cool soft-boiled egg that was then fried and one of the first I'd ever seen and pull it off perfect.  My main dish was perfectly cooked and super tasty ( the barbecued salmon dish).  It was served on top of a bacon potato hash and I ordered the cream corn as a side dish.  Yum yum yum!!!  I wanted to put that potato hash in my pocket and take it home!. I would highly recommend this for anyone coming in and if my review were only based on this then I would give it a five star!  Unfortunately it's not...The other four people in our party decided to order steaks and all of them disliked them...I am from Texas so I never make the mistake of ordering a steak outside of Texas because I am almost always let down.  Our server was mean and did not do her job well. She seemed that it was almost more of an annoyance when we wanted to order anything!  I hate to say it but come on, You're in Vegas as a high end server....The wait time in between drink orders seemed extremely longer than normal and when the manager finally came over to address the steaks, he did nothing....Even though my food was perfect the whole experience was just off-putting and The Decour of the restaurant needs a major overhaul. Bland and boring....I also found it very unprofessional that they had about 15 chairs stacked in the hallway between the restaurant on your way to the bathroom....anyway I hate giving this restaurant only two stars but I want everybody to know...	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	MEJSFmjKGiMsL5daI_uzcA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
PMC7QNTTmeDomzdc35_a9g	5	2008-01-10 00:00:00	This was probably the highlight on my last Vegas trip.\n\nI read a few reviews from some of my favorite Yelpers about their experience in this place. Truth to be told, I was little envy, but was also very excited to finally get to go here after missing out two years ago.\n\nI'm not really big on name of a chef nor do I care about so much about the branding of the place. Here's the funny thing.... I was excited in going to Dan Marino's place only because it was in HOOTERS. \n\nSee, it really doesn't amount to much.\n\nMy dining companion and I made a lunchtime reservation after realizing we couldn't squeezed all the places we wanted to go on this trip. We had already set up a reservation for dinner at Bouchon (at the same hotel at the Venetian) later on the night, so we compromised and reserved a table for Delmonico's for lunch.\n\nIt was an adventure finding place along the restaurant row. We had a harder time finding Bouchon later on the evening, but to get it out the way....this place is next to Aquaknox and the entrance is all the way towards the end of the hall.\n\nThe place was specular. Very classy and refine by the elegance of the look to the place. it's a bit more than what I expected for a fine dining. I guess I was assuming steakhouse in the form of Morton's, but this place outdone itself by making it more classier and upscale than any of the Morton's.\n\nFor lunch, it was casual. Not dressy as it was listed in the profile.\n\nThe lunch menu was very limited. I was almost going to be sorely disappointed because the menu's best item was dry beef sirloin. However my mood was lifted when the waitress presented us with steak menu that normally is on the dinner, but will be serve at lunch as well. \n\nThat was a big relief because I did not want to get stuck with dry aged beef. I proceeded to order Filet Mignon for myself while my partner in crime decided to take one of their special. \n\nThe coolest thing I saw on the menu was a Truffle Parmesan Potato Chip for appetizer. It was a great start to a great meal because I just couldn't get enough of that chip. What amazed me even more was the fact that it was a seasoned POTATO CHIP. Who else would be insane enough to order that for appetizer for $9?\n\nYeah...us!\n\nWe have gotten great service throughout our meal and gotten constant check up from the staff. Anywhere from our wait staff to refill our water and house baked bread (which included the butter with a shade of letter "D") to the chef who came to make sure that the steak was to my liking after changing for the better.\n\nI had ordered it Medium Well, the chef changed it to Medium/Medium rare because the meat was excellent cut that day and I guessed he didn't want to overcook the meat to lose the flavor. Honestly, that was a good decision on his part because the steak was that good. I savored every bite and the meat didn't drip of blood. That would have been too much, but luckily it wasn't.\n\nThe other thing I highly recommend to get was their creme of corn and lobster soup. That was rich in texture, very creamy without being too diluted. That soup itself would make a great meal if they decided to offer it in the menu as a large bowl. The soup was that good.\n\nFor $70, that was a fine meal and I have no regret. Even though the slot machines that was not far away was calling me all day.\n\nOur table was part of the wine tasting lounge. They have a few table that has an open window wall that overlooked the mall of restaurants. it makes it a nice people watching opportunity that scenesters would love. The bar and the lounge sofas are a bit high class for a normal wine tasters, but for the quiet soothing atmosphere this place presents, these things goes very well in that room.\n\nThere is a bigger dining room, but I think dinner would filled it up more. I suggest getting the table there next to the window so that people can watch you eat with jealousy....just kidding!\n\nTo my amazement, I didn't utter the famous catchphrase "Bam!" I might as well since I had a wonderful meal with steak that was cooked just right. if it was a romantic dinner, I would have gave it an awesome "Bam!" \n\nI would definitely try to make it back here again next time when I'm in Vegas.\n--------------------\nQuality: *****\nDecor: *****\nService:****\nAmenity: ****\nAmbiance: *****	17	10	14	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	-Tj4e-zW67MXj9Z7-Zkzpw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

POiFvRbo4UPxrIcbARcRSQ	3	2011-12-03 00:00:00	When I think Delmonico, I think banana cream pie rather than steak. I don't really understand applying cajun rub to a perfectly decent, medium rare porterhouse cut. But I do understand a buttery crust filled with sweet, vanilla-banana pudding and stuffed full of ripe pieces of banana. The pie isn't as creamy as the yummy banana cream pie from Jongewaard's, but I think that may be because the banana to pudding ratio favors the bananas. Delmonico has one of my favorite banana cream pies and, now, is a regular stop during my visits to Vegas. Only 3 stars though because it's a self-proclaimed "steakhouse" and I didn't care for the steak.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	tlp6fiP-YBtmUSXcTyI5rA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
PPIJLo_cL25dLSE5Edm8Jw	4	2013-03-17 00:00:00	We have been wanting to check out Delmonico for a while now, and with it being Restaurant Week, it made sense to stop in!\n\nThey only had a lunch special, but there was a lot of variety, and the food was great! Service was top notch as well, with our glasses never hitting halfway with a smile.  Had to hit it with the 4 star, since some of the food was hit and some miss, but overall everything was good and a great value for RW.\n\nStarted off with a surprise amuse!\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#s2aCXocbqLcx3v6sl0_NZw\n\nThen the apps came out...The Heirloom Tomato Soup with Grilled Ricotta Cheese Sandwich was good! \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#ogoxihGvCtfmoq7L8TD1BA\n\nThe soup itself was a little rich and thick, not very soupy consistency, but it worked well with the delicious Ricotta Cheese sandwich! But I tried a few spoonfuls without the sandwich, and it didn't stand on its own.\n\nVine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#d9kt2ojPgUys4VgvTBOTOg\n\nConsisted of Burrata Cheese, Red Onion, Extra Virgin Olive Oil, Balsamic Vinegar and Torn Local Basil.  The company liked it, but since I am not a fan of tomatoes, I didn't bother trying it.\n\nOn to the entrees!  The Grilled Skirt Steak Sandwich was great!\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#EWRi7UESqNjHjvYn0GlXLQ\n\nIt was on Ciabatta with Roasted Mushrooms & Onions, Horseradish Mayonnaise, Spinach and Truffle French Fries! The sandwich itself was great! The steak was a perfect and tender medium rare, with the horseradish mayo adding the perfect blend of awesome! The truffle fries were great as well, but their style of fries are a bit overcooked for my tastes. Seems like they are twice fried here...and everyone's was like this, so I know it wasn't by accident. Still good though!\n\nButternut Squash Ravioli :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#GQE0e9w2Ew-u0GzjA1SJjQ\n\nConsisted of Sage Brown Butter, Toasted Hazelnuts and Parmesan Cheese. Not bad...very creamy though.\n\nThe desserts were awesome! Emeril's Banana Cream Pie :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#EZOm9VBP7nhTaoF6PABi-A\n\nHad a Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings and Whipped Cream, and it was way to big to finish! Lots of chunks of banana, and the cream pie portion was rich and outstanding. \n\nThe Pecan Pie :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delmonico-steakhouse-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#2PfIwfb5F0JTL9DuO52Wyw\n\nHad an Oatmeal Shortbread Crust, French Vanilla Ice Cream & Caramel Sauce. It was good too! A bit better on the portion control here lol.\n\nAnyways, I want to make it back to check out their steak menu! Seems like they are a little less spendy than some of the others on the strip, with prices on aged beef starting in the high $40s.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

PrZxjurSLVeTQRIrkzBADA	4	2014-10-27 00:00:00	Great steak but disappointing service for the price.  Went here for a friend's bachelor party.  We all got bone-in ribeyes medium rare (of course) with multiple sides and starters.  Unfortunately, mine came out clearly at medium well.  Which would be fine if I were not paying 50+ dollars to enjoy the wonderful dry-aged (etc., etc.) beef.  The steak still tasted good but not as great as it could have been.  I brought this to the attention of the waiter, who offered to bring me a new steak, but I did not wish to wait 15 minutes while my friends ate.  At the end of the meal, the waiter offered a free desert to make up for the steak, but we were all too full to enjoy one, so I declined.  No other offers were made to compensate for the overcooked steak (could have made any one of the drinks, appetizers or sides we ordered) and when the check arrived, the waiter had mistakenly added an extra bottle of wine to the tab (when brought to his attention, he removed it of course).  I know these are minor complaints, but having waited tables at much cheaper restaurants, I have found a way to make it up to a customer when mistakes were made.  I expect at least the same when a table is spending 400 dollars in your restaurant.  So all in all, the food was great, service good, but not up to par for the money you will spend.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	vgkAu9BO8h7oorDWZziMXA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
PtINLvbZbxZ8BTSZUgW1zQ	3	2016-01-14 00:00:00	From being a staple and a visit every single time, lately the visits to Delmonicos have been less than fantastic. \n\nThe filet minion which they used to do perfectly and second to none now usually comes out either overcooked or undercooked. \n\nThe Caesar salad we loved is now a 50/50 shot. \n\nFinally and most disappointing is the $130 seafood tower which is probably the least value I've ever seen. Lobster tails where the meat sticks to the shell and a tuna cup which was really bad. \n\nThey still make the best vanilla ice cream. That's something. :)	0	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	VcTP24h95x8TffmefpdZsg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
ptmt6BIPu21oGBQsUGTlQw	4	2011-12-24 00:00:00	They are known for their bone-in ribeye so I had to try that.  I ordered mine medium rare and it was a little undercooked but still very tasty.  The steak was good but not the best I've had.  What was really amazing was the white fish.  This was the first time I tried the white fish and I will order this again.  I also tried the New Orleans bbq shrimp which was good and the au gratin potatoes.  The sides are huge and we had a hard time finishing one side.  Service was excellent and the restaurant had a nice modern contemporary look which I liked.  Overall, a good steakhouse and I had a good experience here.	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	sskQ99GZO4xJ-3sHwUphRA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
PUKPs2fSq-EWRGV3ySpdnQ	2	2016-02-29 00:00:00	Hard to write this review because I will say my rib eye steak was done to perfection. Well-seasoned, cooked perfectly. Tender and flavorful meat. That's where the compliments stop. We also ordered a side of broccoli to share and some au gratin potatoes. The broccoli at $9 was just horrifying. It's all the reasons that children don't want to eat their vegetables. I think it started with an awful product. The broccoli itself was not only lacking in freshness, it was limp and flavorless. It could not have been good broccoli to begin with. It seemed as if it was frozen and then heated up slightly as it was mushy. It was also underwhelming with seasoning of any sort. Surprising from a restaurant of this caliber. Why bother selling broccoli when it was so disgusting. The au gratin potatoes were good. These at least had salt and were not overly cheesy. I give them a B.\n\nAs for service, it was OK. I realize hard to do good service with large parties. I will tell you that even though the server made up for it in the end, there was a big problem. I ordered a side of foie gras. It appeared on the table in front of me and then at some point in the service, someone from the wait staff came over and took it away from me so quickly, I didn't even have a chance to ask about it. Perplexed, I asked our server. He apologized and tried to get a new order on my table asap and he took it off the bill.  Unfortunately, I cannot recommend the foie that came to me. It was cold in the middle and uninteresting. Let me tell you that cold foie is not good. Disappointing on all fronts.	5	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	czGHgHe0lPHgH9vSGxGczQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Being a celebrity chefs place I had my doubts but will always try something at least once. Delmonico did not disappoint, they delivered on par excellent service and quality food in a classy but intimate ambiance. We have already arranged to go back in the coming Vegas trip. The steaks, as you would expect, were above expectations in taste, searing, and quality of beef. Most importantly in order to enjoy a good meal you need impeccable service along with it. It was the kind of service that is very professional and classy but in a way that makes you feel welcome and comfortable, not stiff and robotic. Its an experience you have to try for yourself that you won't regret. The NY strip will turn a vegetarian!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	vtLGogUiDd1Xla-Rtxf5cg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We didn't wait long and had a drink in the lounge as we waited to be seated.\n\nAfter browsing the menu, my friend and I decided to split the bone-in ribeye, medium well. Our server says it's their house specialty. The steak was completely blackened from the char and the inside was perfectly done. As I cut into it with my knife, I can tell it's going to be chewy....and indeed it was. It had almost no flavor for a dry aged meat. My friend had to ask for steak sauce and sour cream to make it more flavorful.\n\nBUT, the sides we ordered (potato gratin and creamed corn) were awesome! AND my friend's filet mignon was the most tender I've ever had (she gave me some of hers)\n\nThe service was impeccable and friendly...but the food (at least what I ate) was not worth $52 for a steak.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	oYbtwWkVNzsGKA0fst7iGA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I kind of treat Vegas like a giant tapas restaurant and basically go from restaurant to restaurant having an app and drink at each stop so I cannot comment on their food or service other than the apps that I have had there which have been delicious.\n\nMax Solano is Emeril's master mixologist in Vegas and I believe he creates all the signature cocktails for Emeril's Vegas properties or maybe it's just the Venetian/Palazzo properties. Whatever the case may be this man can make a drink. Do yourself a favor and sit and the bar when Max is working and let him design or recommend a drink based on your personal tastes. I have given him just two ingredients that I was craving and had him invent a cocktail for the first time right there in front of me that would rate as the best I have ever had. He is a true artist behind the bar. He also boasts what is one of the most extensive whiskey inventories in the country!\n\nA cocktail or two by Max is a great way to start or end an evening and sometimes both in the same sitting but either way add a Solano cocktail to your Vegas must do list the next time you visit Vegas.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2Nc1W2f-Dyn2_-XGVDhNxw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

If this is your first time, or have a taste bud for Dennys, this is your gig.\n\nThe $57 bone-in rib eye I had was so not tender, cooked raw, just poor when compared to the other non-celebrity famous steak houses (i.e. Metropolitan in Seattle).\n\nThe waitor forgot 1/2 my requests, and it was clearly priced as a tourist trap.  Nothing like Emeril restaurant in New Orleans.\n\nShould have known that this be a tourist trap :(\n\nIts too bad, as I really like Emeril and think brings down the name brand he has built up in the past.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	jLp0HGFcNF6yTUGAVd9W8w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Q40LcItsgg_fhCAo70x61g	2	2013-11-05 00:00:00	Wasn't able to secure a last minute reservation at Craftsteak (which I love by the way) while in Vegas so I reluctantly went w/ Delmonico.\n\nService was good, as expected, but not as warm as I'd like--you know the feeling you get when you can joke around with your server and have that "rapport", I never really clicked w/ the service.  Whatever the case that shouldn't matter because I was there for the RIB EYE!!!\n\nDisappointing... hardly marbled... flavorful yes, but tough enough where I couldn't enjoy every bite.  My pallet favors texture over flavor and although my wife felt the steaks were flavorful, in my opinion the toughness completely buries any goodness from the flavor.\n\nWhat really lowers the score for Delmonico is the sheer fact that it's surrounded by so many other steak houses, I mean it's Vegas after all!! Because of this, I don't see myself EVER coming back	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	7uvfAKXezRXrLWNo1VZWbA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
q4275NVw9p_iiyr-WDlubQ	5	2016-05-03 00:00:00	I hear about all these places that is voted number one for this reason or that reason. Some have titles as "the best steak house on the north end of town". Any time a variable is add to the title I usually questions it. But when I found we had seats at This place I went to google. \n\n"Best steakhouse in Vegas" I read with no extra words to misled the public. Now I'm ready. \n\nFirst thing i noticed is the low lighting and Elegant atmosphere. First glance you would think this place is strictly for high rollers with a private jet parked across the street. However it wasn't a strict dress code.  I saw customers with  tailored suits as we'll as shorts and polo shirts. My suggestion would be to step it up a little bit simply because you are in Vegas. \n\nI will not talk about the price of the meal because when I used Yelp to checking I got a high rollers badge. That means his place is very expensive. Let's just say it was 12 of us and the bill was over $1200 dollars. \n\nI ordered a drink called "THE BRONTE SISTERS" that came to the table in a mid Evil looking copper glass. Then I order another and another. Best drink I've ever had. Beware there isn't any prices on the drink menu but these babies run about 16 bucks. Yikes (disclaimer: I had a good day at the crap tables so I could splurge a bit) \n\nFor started I ordered an Emeril Lagasse BBQ Shrimp with fresh baked Rosemary biscuit. The biscuits was very small but so freaking tasteful. After all the shrimp was devoured I was left with this amazing sauce on the bottom of the plate. If I didn't care if people looked at me like a homeless man with his first meal I would've licked the plate. No lie it was that good.  When the waiter took my plate with all that sauce left I felt like i violated a crime in flavor town. \n\nNow the real reason I'm writing this review THE BONE IN DRY AGED RIBEYE. lord have mercy on my taste buds. Best steak ever.  All that needs to be said.  This is the drop the mic moment and walk off stage.	3	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	iLh0X803CM-iROg385R7tQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Q6a4PoFi1IKk0aZXG8EfEw	2	2010-03-02 00:00:00	Emeril is a liar. The beef that he serves is in no way USDA Prime. Or at least it wasn't on the night we dined there. I have had my share of prime cuts of beef and one thing they are not is tough. Especially a rib-eye. Our steak was not only tough, but flavorless and mealy as well.\nI really wanted to like this place. My husband and I sat at the bar and had great service from the bartender. We split the rib-eye because who in the heck can eat a whole one of those? It was perfectly cooked. Cutting into it was another matter. It took effort. The consistency was mealy, and without one of the three sauces they offer with it, was completely flavorless. I think Emeril is trying to pawn off a lesser grade of beef on poor unsuspecting tourists, some of who he thinks do not know any better. Shame on him. \nTo know what a real USDA Prime cut of beef is head down the road to Ruth's Chris Steak House.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	6CvBV2AaMoRkbqdbs0z6Vg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

A $50 bottle of French wine later and the meal we had was filling, hedonistic, awesome, whatever superlative I could give.\n\nThe appetizers were great; I had gumbo, and split barbeque shrimp and butternut squash ravioli with duck confit on top.  Portions for apps were not  teeny, which was impressive, because honestly I expected it to be.\n\nThen comes the main course.  All four of us split the chateaubriand, which was tender, carved tableside, and delicious.  The crust of the steak was delicious as well.  Almost as impressive were the side dishes; truffle parmesan potato chips and creamed corn (Yes, who thought Creamed Corn could emerge from the cafeteria lunch as a DELICIOUS side dish).\n\nYes, it's expensive; it's Vegas.  But I was very impressed with the quality.  Will gladly go back when I have more $.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	fRJBxBlWZqGgZQr2i3KmmQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
qadtYfh4US1WH6dD0u1LTw	3	2013-03-16 00:00:00	Came here for lunch during restaurant week with a few other Yelpers. It's located in the Venetian, but it's easier if you self park at Palazzo to find it. If you self park, you have to walk through the entire hotel to get to restaurant row, which is where Delmonico's is located.\nI was the first to arrive so I sat in the bar area, which was very cozy. Before long, we were seated at our table. The restaurant had a few others dining in there but it wasn't busy at all.\nThere were 3 waiters servicing our table. One for water, one to clear and one to serve. Maybe not specifically, but it seemed that way. \nThe chef sent over a complimentary appetizer for the table; lemon ricotta served over thinly sliced red apple and bruschetta with tapenade and pesto. (I think a green apple would have been much better. I dont care for the texture nor the taste of red apples) The appetizer was very nice. The soup followed and I didnt care for that one bit. It tasted like warm ketchup. Ew. Ew, ew, ew. So not a fan. Thankfully, that was the only dish I didn't care for. The grilled cheese that accompanied the soup was very good. I enjoyed that quite a bit. The tomato salad and the house green salad that others ordered looked absolutely delicious. Every one finished everything, so I guess they liked it too.\nThe salmon entree was delicious. I asked for it cooked well done and it came back, cooked fantastically! It wasn't medium at all and it was so juicy. Even Christina who likes hers cooked much less, said it was very good. I tried her butternut squash ravioli. It was OK. The flavor in the ravioli was good, but it 1. should have been warmer and 2. the pasta was too soft. It should have been al dente. \nThe dessert was good as well. Your choice between banana cream pie or pecan pie. I opted for the pecan. It was served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. It was good too. I tried Christina's banana cream pie, and it tasted good, although I didn't care for the look of it, with all those squares of banana. \nThe service was very good, they didn't add the 18% automatically (I prefer when places do that, honestly). The food was good, not great, but good. The price, $30.13 for 3 courses was OK. It was "pricey" for lunch, however, the quality of the food and the portions were generous.\nI dont really see myself going back there. There are a lot of other places I'd like to try and places that I love already that I will return to. It was a great time with great people!	2	0	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	8OeTLey-p-WaL9ErNEci1Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

QC2fRDpHZbL73QJ0g6lE5w	4	2016-06-28 00:00:00	Delmonico är kända för sina stekar och det var precis det jag beställde. Deras signatur stek "Bone-in Ribeye" för $55. Jag slogs direkt över hur pass gigantisk den var. Utan tvivel var det den fetaste och största steken jag har ätit, och även för mig som brukar sluka stekar utan som helst problem tog det lite tid och krävdes skicklighet att få ned den. Som tur är var den fullkomligt gudomlig och tillagad precis som jag älskar.\n\nTill detta tog jag en sidobeställning på krämig spenat som var relativt standard, och inget speciellt och en förrätt som var löksoppan, och den var faktiskt riktigt god och hade en intressant tvist om att osten låg på insidan av soppan och inte var helt smält på toppen, det gillades skarpt. \n\nNär det kommer till desserten var Delmonico lite busiga och erbjöd "Creme Brulée på ankägg" och det smakade faktiskt inte annorlunda alls, så det var lite tråkigt att jag föll för den. Den var förövrigt inte särskild imponerande ens. \n\nMen summarum, man kommer hit för en anledning: stek. Och här levererade Delmonico en nästan perfekt sådan som jag sent kommer att glömma.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	8YDthec81bjPSa6Z10xOZg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Last time we went I had the sea bass, which was quite tasty.  As always, try to leave room for the banana cream pie!\n\nThe other places have a certain vibe to it that feels like it would be an Emeril Lagasse restaurant, for some reason this one doesn't.

I love being critical, what can I say. But, as much as it pains me to say this, I didn't find one thing I hated about Delmonico Steakhouse. (ARGH!!)\n\nThe lobster bisque. Excellent. Best lobster bisque I've ever had in my life. Hands down. Add a little bit of cracked pepper on top and you have a wonderful tasting starter complete with its generous portion of lobster meat. I should've asked for a second order of it.\n\nMy ribeye was perfectly cooked and flavorful. Ribeye is usually a cut of meat with a good amount of fat on it. My ribeye had the perfect balance of meat and fat. Fat means flavor, people! I was glad I didn't have to cut off too much of it from my meat. We ordered a side of roasted fingerling potatoes (w/ whole garlic and fresh herbs) and buttered fresh broccoli. These sides complimented my ribeye very well, but I'm being a little biased here because broccoli and fingerling potatoes are my favorite veggies (#1 and #2, respectively). I couldn't finish the massive 16 oz. piece of meat and the sides, so I took them all to go. I wound up eating the rest of it for breakfast the next morning. Can you say best breakfast ever? Yes.\n\nApart from a patron at the restaurant that was loud and sounded like Mr. Krabs from Spongebob Squarepants, my dining experience here was top notch! I couldn't ask for more from the food, service, and ambiance. You're welcome, Delmonico Steakhouse...	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2sVdJp360sdA7rPBEgnPqw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

In a town that tries to pinch you for every nickel bringing in our own wine, a 2001 Peju ($200+ bottle) from our personal cellar may have hurt his pocket.  Living here in Vegas probably raised my standard of Service, especially when you take home six figures as a Professional Server.   Yup.  It is a career here vs a job for most places in the world.

QLfb3TkwAB75k4PPdEm0Sw	5	2011-05-31 00:00:00	Amazing steak, as well as some of the best service I've ever had at a restaurant.\n\nMy friends and I came here for dinner on a Sunday (with a reservation, just in case), and we decided to split two steaks between 3 girls. We ehard that the portions are very generous, and we also wanted to try out the sides as well.\n\nWe ordered the bone in ribeye, along with the bone in filet mignon with a mushroom sauce (one of the specials of the day).  We also ordered the truffle parmesan potato chips, as well as the creamed corn gratinee and the country smashed potatoes.\n\nThe first thing to come out were the potato chips. Sadly, for a girl who eats potato chips as her main meal frequently, I couldn't partake of them because of the parmesan (I cannot stand stinky cheese).  However, I did at least try ONE, and the texture of the chip (similar to a kettle chip almost), and the slight hint of truffle was amazing. However, the parmesan was still prominent, so I watched sadly while my gfs devoured the chips. I felt as if I was being punished, for some reason.\n\nLuckily our steaks arrived at that point, and they were HUGE. It was definitely a good idea that we had decided to split two instead of each of us ordering our own.  Our server (who's name I forgot), was incredibly helpful and nice. He brought over a carving table and after presenting the steaks to us, took them aside and carved them all for us.  We got our sides at that point too, and we just dug in.\n\nThe rib eye was incredibly flavorful. I tend to not normally order it because not all places will grill the ribeye properly and I end up with a slightly tough steak (even if ordered at medium). This one had just the right amount or pink, and the seasoning was mild enough so that the flavor of the meat shone through.  \n\nThe filet was also very tender.  While we were eating the filet without the mushroom demiglace, I decided to test it out.  The sauce is based on a reduction of veal stock, and it complimented the steak wonderfully. It didn't mask the taste of the meat at all but just added another dimension to it.  After urging my friends to try the sauce, we quickly started pouring spoonfuls of it over the rest of the steak on our plates.\n\nThe sides were very good as well. The creamed corn had a hint of spice due to some mined jalapenos that were in it. Definitely a trick I am looking forward to trying at home.\n\nAs great as the food was, I was also very impressed with the level of service. You would think that a fancy steak restaurant would be annoyed at the sharing of steaks, but they never batted an eye to our request (apparently a lot of people do this).  In addition, we never felt as if we were waiting to flag down a server whenever we needed assistance.\n\nFor everything we got, the meal itself also came out to be a lot less than I expected (although I'm sure it has to do with the sharing as well). However, we were so full and satisfied from our meal that we promptly fell asleep back in our room and decided against going out that night. That is definitely a sign of a great meal.	3	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	HQ6YepQ4uk3ztsa1Ommshw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Back about 10+ years ago, I remember Emerill's hot steak and seafood restaurant having excellent steak, tasty gumbo and wonderful desserts. \n\nThe ambiance and service were excellent. We started with the gumbo which was very bland and toned down from the original. The barbeque shrimp were ok, but nothing to write home about. For dessert, the banana creme pie was still excellent.\n\nI remember Delmonico as a solid 4 star steak spot, and wonder what has happened. It's very sad to see this happen to what used to be one of my favorites.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	CyAl5D-GjX-ZtqdQqG4_ew	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
QNloSuA6gAZ2Xakod_BlVQ	4	2010-10-24 00:00:00	I have to admit, I didn't try the steak there.  Based on everyone else in my group who was eating, they loved it though.  I ate semi light for my dinner: a crab bisque soup, spinach salad, and a baked potato.  All of it was very very good.  Being that said, that still cost me $35 easy. There really is no cheap thing to eat here, other then the sides that went for $9 a pop.  The atmosphere is pretty relaxed.  The service is good.  They paid attention to the little things that mattered like re-filling up your water when your cup is empty, and coming back every 10 minutes or so to ask if you need anything else.  Be prepared to bring a chunk of change with ya...steaks costs anywhere from $50 to $60 depending on how you want it prepped or what kind of steak you want.  I would try this place again, and see if the steak is really that damn good.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	-fUARDNuXAfrOn4WLSZLgA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Located next to the Blue Man group theatre at the Venetian, this place was packed on a Saturday night and for good reason. \n\nFrom reading all the other reviews, there really wasn't any other choice to be made than to order the bone-in ribeye. We both ordered that except I got mines with foie gras since I miss it sooo much (california ban no bueno). I understand how fattening it is, especially with a steak, but its Vegas and she looked so effing hot and I told myself, NIKE! (just do it!) I got mines medium rare like the pros and it came out just as I had hoped - not overcooked, although there were small parts where I questioned if it was too rare for me! I mean my whole mentality that night before we met up with my friends at Hakkasan ft. Calvin Harris was #yolo! so I figured it WHY NOT? To my very surprise, I managed to finish ~85% of the huge piece of steak, which was quite an accomplishment for myself. The meal itself was exquisite, with service being impeccable, and a prefix to one amazing night.	2	3	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	1rlB-SWvDU5TnDnym2qeDw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Qp2mGtSqWTsfK0FqgDUGtA	1	2013-11-28 00:00:00	Went in last night with a party of 5.  Unfortunately the service was really off.  Having dined here a few times with solid results, I was underwhelmed by this meal.  Took about 20 minutes to get the drinks out, was served appetizers with no silverware, soup was barely warm 1st time, 2nd try hot with a skin, mains sat for 15 min on a tray waiting to be served.  Spoke with the manager and he end up taking one of the mains off the bill.  Way to much competition in steakhouses at this price point to risk a repeat of this experience.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	gvYrTjB3FuMZ_qkrm5cpeA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
qpdCQSHSWCK9-hIie0yWsQ	4	2012-10-20 00:00:00	This place was great. We came with a party of 12. We chose the restaurant based on the wine list and this had one of the best on the strip. The gumbo was good. The filet was great. The only part I didn't enjoy was the oysters. We mentioned it to two different waiters and only ate about 6 of the 12 oysters. We were all a little upset and we spent $1500 on dinner and they couldn't take the oysters we didn't care for off the bill.\n\nWe sure to stop by the bar on the way in or out. Not only is the wine list worth the trip but if you like high-end bourbon this is a great place. They have several different Pappy Van Winkle bourbons and Templeton Rye.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	J6RPgT1dTY0zg2qxPtUdTg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
QRAcv6_RflqgWbJ0ZV55sA	5	2011-11-10 00:00:00	I had the privilege of coming here in honor of two fo my friends' birthdays last month. Being the type of guy who rarely eats at anywhere higher than a two $ sign establishment, I'd have to say this is by far the best dining experience I've ever had in my life, so far.\n\nOur night started off with a VERY informative waiter showing us the ropes. It makes sense why these servers make the money they make, they are extremely good at their job and know the menu and wine pairings like the back of their hand. ..at least the server we had was of this caliber.\n\nFor starters, we had the Truffle Parmesean potato chips. These things are incredible. It's one of those dishes where you just want to savor each bite one chip at a time. SO GOOD.\n\nWe also tried the Lobster Bisque. Best Lobster Bisque I've ever had. Very smooth, rich in lobster flavor, and not too overly salty. Some fresh cracked pepper makes it just absolutely perfect.\n\nMy two friends went for the chateaubriand. An exquisite cut of tenderloin(same cut as filet mignon) SO tender that it just nearly melts in your mouth.\n\nI had the Bone in Rib-eye. Quite possibly the best steak I've ever had in my life. I ordered it medium rare. It was cooked perfectly, and once I had a taste, I just had to close my eyes and shut down all my other senses so that I can thorougly enjoy this. It was quite a big steak, but with the price I paid and the epic state of mind I was in, I finished it knowing that I couldn't leave all that buttery meaty goodness behind unfinished.\n\nThat on top of a bottle of wine and a few sides, our meal came out to be.. well.. expensive.

Ladies, wear your fat dress for this meal.. you'll thank me later.\n\n+ bone-in ribeye medium rare (9/10): amazing steak! Perfectly cooked and they were generous enough to split it in half for us when we said we were sharing.

A perfect blend of cows milk, sheep's milk and goats milk cheeses from mild to sharp! The almonds and honey rounded the dish off nice. For the main course We each had a different cut of meat. That was so we could "share experiences" and explore the menu. It was a great idea. I had Ribeye, my husband had the bone in ribeye, my brother had the filet and my mother had the filet prime special. Omg! All was juice, perfectly cooked and promptly brought to the table! Our sides were delectable!! Creamed corn and potatoes gratin accompanied the steaks perfectly. Honestly, the only thing lacking in my opinion was the overly simple décor!

qx3Ba91UzIasxowH0f2x5Q	4	2009-03-22 00:00:00	Besides having to finance your meal with a 20% deposit, this is the best steak and lamb my wife and I have ever had. The filet Mignon was ridiculously tender and perfectly seasoned. You do not have to put any salt or pepper on anything. The lamb was even better and the portions were huge (9 oz filet and 2 lamb racks). We started with a lump crab cake which had a dill caper sauce that was AMAZING. To give you an idea of what we spent, we got an appetizer (crab cake), two cocktails, filet mignon, lamb with truffle oil, side of potatoes (everything is al a carte so sides you get separately family style) was $150 without tip. Expensive I know, but I guess that's Vegas; $6 waters, and $100 market price lobster. \n\nThe only downside is that this place is LOUD!!! The way the ceilings and the rooms are built noise just bounces around so if you are looking for a quiet romantic dinner, I wouldn't go here. If you are looking for the best steak of your life, this is a great place. \n\nA couple rounds of blackjack might help you pay for you meal. I probably wouldn't eat here again... at least until I save up over next 30 years. Good luck! :)	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	be4K9MZmJTN6TSbpP1O3tw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

QZ99f4u9ZemC8utzm8mj7Q	5	2010-08-18 00:00:00	One of the best steak houses in Las Vegas. 3 of us ordered the bone in ribeye ($52 / order) and 1 of us ordered the filet (less than the bone in ribeye). I think the waiter said that the ribeye was a solid 19 ounce steak while the filet was 9 ounces so you can see the meat difference.\n\nOur server told us that they put a rub on the steak, the steak is carefully aged as well, and cook it with butter so it comes out with a nice char. Steaks were cooked perfectly and I like my steaks medium rare.\n\nWe also paired it with a nice Sequoia Grove Cabernet Sauvignon 2006.\n\nThe appetizers that we had were the truffle oil chips, creamed corn and sauteed mushrooms. The truffle and parmesan chips are a must to get...they're heavily!!! (couldn't taste the parmesan...even though I dislike cheese).\n\nIt's a must try steak house if you're ever in Las Vegas for a great meal!!!	2	0	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	hwPmywvSVeGrSS6NvzVuyg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

R-Dncvwg2hoeUnAozD8yaw	3	2011-06-21 00:00:00	My girlfriends and I decided to treat ourselves to a nice dinner while in Vegas. Located in the Venetian, the restaurant itself is gorgeous in its simplicity. We were seated promptly, our drinks came in a heart beat, and the staff was very efficient and friendly. \n\nHowever, I recently had the best steak of my life in Havasu and I find that every steak I've had since then has been found wanting... My medium rare ribeye didn't have as much marbling as I like. It wasn't as succulent. It wasn't as tender. It wasn't seasoned enough. It didn't compare.\n\nPerhaps my expectations of Emeril's restaurant were too high. But of the two appetizers, two sides, two cocktails, and steak that I had that night, the Potatoes Gratin was my  favorite dish, which is unfortunate because steak should always be the best part of the meal	11	8	7	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	adTCBz-NBRH8iMOP2M-V6A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
R18_e_RfcMAhVKu8Ws9QxA	5	2015-05-13 00:00:00	Husband suggested that we come back here for lunch today. They started us off with two bread poppers each which were not bad. I ordered a lobster bisque soup as starter which was insanely delicious. Probably one of the better lobster bisques I've ever tasted.  It has big chunks of lobster meat in the soup.  Although the first sip of the soup seemed a little salty, the flavor is very good, strong and savory. It is one of my favorite dishes here. \n\nMy husband ordered the beef carpaccio arugula salad because the salad we normally order from here is no longer on the menu. We were not sure what to order but after we tasted the salad we loved it. It is a very large salad which almost felt like a meal and it has a very clean balanced savory taste.  My husband says that this was one of his favorite salads; me on the other hand I still like the old salad I used to older here.  maybe I'm just more old-school and like my salad plain with arugula, spinach, tomatoes and good cheese. \n\nWe ordered two entrées. One was the salmon entrée which was insanely divine. It is served with a big piece of salmon fillet with grilled sweet corn and crab pieces which complimented the salmon impeccably. Both my husband and I love this dish and we both indicated that we will be ordering this again in the future when we come back here. In fact we may each order one of this salmon dish. That is how much we love this dish. It is very delicious. Any salmon lover should definitely give the salmon dish a try.\n\nThe other entrée that we ordered was the lobster sliders. I did not know that this was a cold sandwich dish. I personally do not like cold sandwiches and also I only like my lobster done the traditional way so that you can taste the natural fresh sweet flavors of a good lobster. The lobster sliders had some kind of seasoning/dressing to it. Although they did not skimp on the lobster meat and they do give you a lot of big chunks of lobster meat with the sliders, the taste was not to my personal liking. I think I will stick with the salmon entrée and my lobster bisque in the future.\n\nCome check out this place when you're in town. You will not be disappointed.	0	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	DtRcSsLRs7RpBds53BnCdw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
R1snlMnx0Yu-eymiT0nvEA	5	2010-04-03 00:00:00	I could describe many above average facets of the meal I had at Delmonico, but the only one that really matters is that I walked out of this restaurant saying that this was the best steak I have ever had.\n\nThe Kansas City cut (bone-in NY Strip) here is just so unbelievably perfect.  It is seared on the outside with a beautiful medium rare on the inside.  The texture is perfect.  The juiciness of the meat is perfect.  The salty flavor addition from the bone is perfect.  And what really made it for me was the seasoning on the steak itself.  Every bite had a little peppery bite that was the perfect combination of dancing around the edges of your tongue without being overbearing.\n\nYes.  A confluence of the perfection of all the individual elements that matter yields the distinction of Best Steak I Have Ever Had.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Y7E3vmhRD_jZ-xb3Sg2eSg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
R5QVS4EAiK0L51fjAjLJsw	5	2017-07-05 00:00:00	I'm so full! This was one of the best, expensive meals I've had in some time.  I chose the restaurant based on location (I'm staying at the Venetian) and, of course, the menu.  There were several items that looked delicious, and each of my choices was outstanding. \n\nTo start, the service was excellent. I had three servers, and my iced tea was always full. When I let the server know this was my first time visiting, he brought out a small plate with two bite-sized, yummy appetizers. I chose the prix fixe menu, starting with the beef carpaccio. The carpaccio with the crispy capers and garlic emulsion melted in my mouth.  \n\nFor the main course, I had the recommended Emeril's BBQ salmon.  I chose medium rare, and it was cooked to perfection.  The sauce was great, and I loved the onions on top.\n\nDesert was pecan pie with an incredible oatmeal shortbread crust.  I would probably order it without the whipped cream as it wasn't needed with the vanilla ice cream, but I wish I could have the pecan pie every day. Scrumptious! \n\nIt's not a cheap dinner, but the atmosphere, service and menu make it well worth it for a nice dinner out.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	dgpDEsOD7ji1t0LBVOC1Zg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
R5XfXA6zNkwHK5SnQrL-Zg	2	2014-03-09 00:00:00	My boyfriend and I dined at Delmonico's on a trip to Vegas  in July 2013 - for dinner on the 4th of July.  The restaurant we had originally planned to go to that night was completely booked, so based on the great Yelp rating we chose Delmonico's instead.  \n\nPrior to our trip, we were so excited to try this place out.  Our reservations were at 8pm and we showed up a few minutes early, expecting the place to be packed.  I should mention that the location is very odd and not easy to find.  However, once we found it we started wondering if we were  in the right place...  Both of us have dined in nice steakhouses many times and expected that familiar 5 star experience.  From the second we walked in the door it was clear that Delmonico's was not that kind of place.\n\nThe entrance was very dark - no one was at the hostess stand and the bar/lounge area was completely empty.  The restaurant looked closed.   Then, the hostess showed up with another employee - they finished their casual, not work related, conversation before greeting us.  They looked up our reservation and sat us right away so I was ready to let go of my first impression and enjoy a great meal.  Unfortunately, that was just the start.  \n\nThe hostess led us into a mostly empty room with very dim lighting.  We thought it was weird but went along with it.  As we sat down, we realized that the only other table in the room was a large party with serval children - who were playing games and watching movies on their iPads! We were shocked that this behavior was allowed in such a place.  We looked into the other dining room which was mostly full and seemed very lively, full of adults.  When our waiter came over we asked to move to that room (pointing out the distractions at the other table), which they accommodated.\n\nFinally in the environment we were hoping for, we felt relieved as our new waiter handed us a wine list.  The waiter brought the wine and as he poured the glasses, he spilled an entire glass in front of me, on the table.  Did he find us a new table? Did he bring a new (full) bottle of wine? No. Instead he picked the glass up and continued pouring and brought a white napkin to place in front of me to cover the wine stained/wet area.\n\nAt this point, we considered leaving but it was past 8:30 and we wanted to try the steak, so we stayed.  We ordered the table side Caesar salad and the chateaubriand to split.  The salad was the highlight of the meal - if you go here, make sure to order it.  The steak was ok, slightly undercooked and we have definitely had better.  After the meal, we decided to skip desert here and go upstairs to Otto instead.\n\nI did use the restroom during the meal.  This was another disappointment.  The restrooms are located down a long hallway, which was also where they stored the extra chairs (stacks of them).  You felt like you were in an area of the restaurant that shouldn't be customer facing - cluttered, scuffs all over the walls and baseboards. \n\nOverall, the experience at Delmonico's was anything but 5 star.  With so many wonderful restaurants in vegas at this price point, there is no reason to choose Delmonico's.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	MWxRm-RkYBymEi55IpBViQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
r6xCCB_IfGqwpc8psAVKjQ	5	2010-08-30 00:00:00	LOVE me some Delmonico! \nAs a big fan of Emeril Lagasse, I had to stop in to one of his restaurants in Vegas, and figured I would have to eat here for my birthday dinner. Definitely, definitely worth it.\nFirst off, if you're stopping in, I would recommend making reservations beforehand, as it can get quite busy, especially Friday and Saturday nights. Love the fact that it's in the Venetian, as that's usually my go to hotel in Vegas, and very easy to get to from the Casino floor.\nVery casual atmosphere, but very upscale service. Our server was fantastic, and we were well taken care of from the moment we stepped in. First class all the way.\nThe food was everything I was hoping for and more. Had calimari for an appetizer- delicious. The bread that came with the meals- delicious. Decided on the filet mignon for main course, with sides of creamed corn and cheese grits. Spectacular. The filet mignon was the best steak I've ever had, bar none. Cooked PERFECTLY, it just melted in my mouth, and you couple that with the creamed corn, which seriously could be the best vegetable I've ever eaten, and holy smokes, you've got yourself a classic meal. \nSince it was my birthday, I decided on the root beer float for desert. Awesome. It was a New Orleans root beer served with homemade vanilla ice cream, and it was awesome. Just awesome. Plus side- the servers hooked me up with a free chocolate cake type desert because it was my special day! I felt so loved!\nOverall, I LOVE Delmonico. The prices are a lot more than you'd pay for an outback or longhorn, but that should be a given. The service was spectacular, the atmosphere fantastic, and the food out of this world. If you're looking for a delicious steak dinner on the strip, it doesn't get any better than Emeril's Delmonico.

The food, service and prices were right on point!\n\n$55 for the bone-in rib eye is a steal.  It is huge and enough to feed two people.  Needless to say, my party of 4 ordered way too much food.  We had two bone-in rib eyes ($55 each, probably about 20 oz. each), the flounder ($40), BBQ salmon ($36), sauteed mushrooms, asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the mashed potatoes.  It had a pasty texture to it.  I prefer my mashed potatoes fluffy.  We topped off the night with a slice of the banana cream pie.  OMG -- I had it three years ago on another visit and hadn't stopped thinking about it.  I wish we hadn't ordered so many entrees so I could have had my own slice!\n\nWe asked for both steaks to be cooked medium.  It was a PERFECT medium!\n\nI seriously can't wait to go back to Vegas.  Emeril never disappoints so I find myself frequenting all of his establishments in the city. \n\nP.S.  The lobby area is nice.  Lots of seats and big screen TVs.  We topped off the night by watching the end of the USC-Nebraska Holiday Bowl game.  Go Trojans!  We won... barely.  Phew.	0	0	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	LcqNuhqaYt5ekKzaRirmIg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Boo!\n\nI ordered the rib eye steak and we all shared to creamed spinach, the smashed potatoes and the sauteed garlic mushrooms.  They were all really good.  The steak was cooked perfectly (medium rare for me). Very tender! I wasn't a fan of the creamed spinach there but the potatoes and the mushrooms were fantastic!\n\nWe skipped on the dessert but I did have a great red wine with my dinner.	3	2	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	OaQA6cyD7S-DdKqT7N14rw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Not quite as flashy as some of the other steak joints, but who cares when the food is great.  We had some apps to start: chips were awesome and the tartar was fantastic.  Moving on to the bone in Ribeye was a 10. It was cooked to perfection and the crust from the sear was just right.  A little bit of butter on top and wala perfection.  The wine list is pretty comprehensive as well.  Prices were surprisingly reasonable.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	bB05wxh1UEWjzNTr1Jgheg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

My gf and I both got what they are known for which is their bone in rib eye. Just a heads up though, only get this is you are starving because this piece of meat is HUGE! I swear it must've been a 12oz! I almost forgot to mention that we also had the lobster bisque and this was also delicious! Words cannot describe how good the food is here, even the service is awesome! If you are starving and craving for some really good food you HAVE to try this place! The only downfall is their chairs don't have wheels on them so you can't be rolled out!	4	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Mg69Pz-fzGd8RQEBiO9kHQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
raYQuS58GGITvLd4Tqm_Dw	1	2010-06-03 00:00:00	Our perfect ending to Memorial Day weekend in Vegas had to be at a great restaurant- I Yelped and found that Delmonico Steakhouse had great reviews-  There were 7 of us girls including me that decided to dine there. Our reservations were at 10pm Sunday night we got seated right away. \n\nI do feel bad for giving 1 start because the service was EXCELLENT. However the food was soo dissapointing. We ordered calamari to share- the marinara sauce that accompanied it tasted like Ragu from a jar. Like I said 7 girls with 1 order of calamari there was more then 80% left on the plate. We then got our salads which i have nothing to complain about then again it was just greens and dressing- I ordered the cowboy ribeye which they are known for and the most popular menu item. I ordered it Medium. We also ordered creamed corn, spinich, potatoes au gratin, and asparagus. \n\nCowboy Ribeye Steak- WORST STEAK EVER!!! it was over cooked too chewey and tasted old- I thought maybe it was just me but I had 3 of the girls taste and they thought the same- Really dissapointed :(\n\nCreamed Spinich- Undercooked \n\nPotatoes Au Gratin- Good but not the best I had ever had lacked flavor\n\nAsparagus- Cant go wrong with that\n\nBottle of Wine was excellent we had the Cuvee\n\nBottom line we were really dissapointed. I am not the type to complain so we did not let the staff know- You would think that they would notice we hardly ate anything but whatever. I know I wont be going there ever again or recommending it to anyone either. \n\nservice was good but what good is the service if the food sucked this bad :(	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	_Q8rrkDjLabvBCj5SLf88A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
rb5f1AsMHNU0fhg77COfTA	2	2017-06-10 00:00:00	It's a higher end steakhouse, so you should be dressed appropriately coming here.\n\nThe service was absolute professional perfection.\n\nThe sommelier was was not impressive in the least.\n\nThe food was good, but not even close to what I expect from the price range and names associated with this place. It certainly wasn't bad, but the steaks left a lot to be deserved in my humble opinion.\n\nNext time, I'll probably pass this one and try one of the MANY other restaurants in Vegas.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	fvh08J7OvKMGqhWFtgoWvg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
RBChssN2e2W83xoCxcAVgw	3	2013-03-20 00:00:00	I got a chance to enjoy Delmonico Steakhouse during LV Restaurant Week. We went there for lunch and I'll take some of the blame for the experience because I ordered a a burger instead of a specialty, but it could have been better. It would have been nice to have someone ask me how to prepare it to my liking. Other than that, the staff was great and I had my very first piece of pecan pie there. I may go back again, but I'd have to be convinced.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	aLud1U6pr_mbVaH6OnYUqQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

They have a way of making you feel special. We ordered the summer trio that came with three courses. My husband had the NY strip steak cooked to perfection and I had the halibut. Our neighboring table ordered the seafood tower, which looked fabulous. Next time, I'll have the seafood tower for $130! It will be worth the experience.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	qEX7E-f2AyVJ-cQDmYAiOg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

No need for nerves here.\n\nWe had an excellent wait staff take care of us. You are not there for the decor but for the food so don't judge this book by its cover.\n\nMy friends each ordered the filet and I the rib eye. We also ordered the lobster bisque, the creamed spinach (a must), broccoli and fingerling potatoes. Everything was divine. My friends both wanted to cry over how perfect their filets were. \n\nI have no idea what wine we had but all in all I could not have asked for a nicer meal. I recommend it for the experience of going as well as the wonderful food.\n\nAnother plus is people were dressed for a nice dinner and not in casual shorts and such. The mealk ran about $100.00 per person after everything.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Uu7jczGF9DOIF0Q1k0jfqw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
RCdloIkpmW8uj6LMos0_AQ	5	2010-02-26 00:00:00	I didn't come here for the steak...but the fish was just as good! Plus, this was one of the few restaurants that was still seating at like 10pm on a Monday night. \n\nA must try is the lobster potato gnocchi appetizer. It is heavenly! I want to order like 5 of these and make it into my entree! The gnocchi is prepared in my favorite way- toasted and a bit crispy on the outside. Yum! And of course, there was a hefty serving of lobster knuckle meat!\n\nFor my main dish, I had the sturgeon with crab lumps in a lemon butter sauce. Again, I was impressed! Lots of crab meat and everything was full of flavor. I also tried some of the bone-in ribeye, which was huuuuge. If you're super hungry, order a steak from here and you won't be disappointed. For dessert, I had the chocolate bread pudding, which was good...but a bit too rich and chocolate-y. I would've preferred a traditional bread pudding.\n\nI should take off one star for the strand of hair I found baked into my bread...but the rest of my meal made up for it, so it didn't bother me too much!	3	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	G40odYEY9J4iWOZvfRT_xA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
rCNM8RaAOdl1UsPDsyr6uA	4	2013-06-03 00:00:00	Given the high price point of the steakhouse, it would have taken a much better steak to justify a five-star rating. I had the bone-in ribeye, which was solid and my date had a petite filet, which was also solid -- but nothing fantastic. The salads were also fairly good, and the creamed corn was amazing. We were too stuffed for dessert, but all in all, a good meal.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	BYii9aApb__ZCOxSBOTlbg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
rCP-ch_235BvetH7-nUCjw	3	2012-07-03 00:00:00	A bit torn about this place...\n\nI heard through the grape vine that Delmonico Steakhouse was the best steakhouse in Las Vegas. Having heard that, I made reservations for Delmonico 2 whopping months prior to my boyfriend's birthday.\n\nThe evening finally arrived when we were going to dine at this fabulous establishment. Upon entering the host was a bit busy fiddling with something to greet me immediately. When he did, he told us to have a seat in the lounge and that our table would be ready shortly. After 2 minutes, our hostess showed us to our table and even laid the napkin in our laps. It didn't take long for us to order so I got the filet mignon and a side of potatoes gratin, while my boyfriend had the ribeye and the jumbo crab.\n\nInitially the filet mignon was quite delicious, very juicy and delicious. Getting near the end of my filet, however, it started getting dry, and I tasted the herbs and spices grinding against my tongue. The potatoes gratin were good but a little dry, I would have liked it to be a little more moist. I tried a piece of my boyfriend's ribeye and it was nice and tender, and the jumbo crab did not disappoint.\n\nOur server(s) were nice, however I felt a bit rushed during the meal. He did one hell of a job taking our pictures tho! Overall, Delmonico's would be a 3.5	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	KcEfVfc5nTPBDonYjJ3wOw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

rED1cJlaOouwEAag8tgGhQ	5	2012-02-16 00:00:00	For an upscale steakhouse its great, I've had Ruth's Chris, Morton's, etc and its hard to say which is best. The steak, Bone-in Ribeye, was beautifully cooked, seasoned well, and tasted magnificent. But that isn't why this spot is so memorable! The unique flavors of the rest of the meal is the reason why I would go back. For appetizer I had the BBQ shrimp which was deep, smoky, rich, had a little kick, and was out of this world, definitely something you finish and contemplate ordering another. Lobster bisque was phenomenal, nice big chunks of meat, smooth explosive flavor. The sides were on point too but nothing extraordinary. They also had this crisp local beer form Louisiana called Abita Amber which was awesome. Overall I left only complaining about how stuffed I was.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	m81WZOJbaUEnhwo3Nanoyg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I ordered the pork loin which came with two pieces of pork belly as well and it was cooked to perfection...very tender and moist.

rHOPSUxE8zGj6ibOd_Pdeg	1	2010-07-26 00:00:00	HORRIBLE.  absolutely horrible.  i've had dental surgeries that were more enjoyable than this evening and paying the bill was like paying taxes.\n\ni know a lot of yelpers have had good experiences and i apologize if i'm bringing those down.  but for us, we called months in advance to make reservations.  because of a show we were to attend we had to have dinner late that evening.  so in making the reservations we asked the person if that would be a problem.  we had no desire to be rushed through dinner and out of the restaurant, so we would have changed our plans if it would have been an issue.  she told us, "oh no problem, absolutely no problem.".  we even told her what our worries about a late reservation were and again she assured us, "no problem".  so when we got there we ordered salads and wine.  i noticed the waiter kept pushing us to order so i told him "we'd like to finish our salads before we order".  sure enough....."well our kitchen is going to close in 15-minutes so you have to place your order now".  what do you do?  i'd already ordered a $200.00 bottle of wine.  so we ordered our meal.\n\nalthough the steak was good the vegetables looked like they had sat on the stove most of the evening.  the potato was so cold it wouldn't even melt the butter they shoved in it.  i couldn't believe it.  i managed to get through most of the steak, giving up when all around me the wait staff started setting up tables for the next day.  you would think at a minimum they would have left the lights turned down low so we could have enjoyed our meal with some sense of ambience.  but i guess the wait staff wouldn't have been able to see the glasses they were polishing at every table around us.  literally every table around us.  of course the music was turned off once the lights came up so we got to listen to all their conversations for entertainment.\n\nour waiter was arrogant border-lining on rude.  this one is funny, get this....when i asked for a wine recommendation he actually looked at me and said, "how much would you like to spend.  $50.00?".  residing in hawaii we were in dress aloha wear but i assure you we didn't look like we were going to try to pay with food stamps.  when we were seated he was so kind and cordial to the table of young ladies next to us i was surpised at what we got out of him.  i guess i should have strapped on some boobs to increase our chances of decent respectable service.     \n\ni think the worse fallout from this experience for me is now i don't want to waste time or energy going to one of the major chef's restaurants.  i mean this was emeril's place for god sakes.  i'm originally from the south and understand southern hospitality, which i thought emeril attempts too express in everything he does.  i assure you it doesn't exist in this place.  this restaurant has literally turned me against "fine dining".  i should have went to the hard rock and saved $350.00.  \n\nanyone know where i can buy strap-on boobs?  i might want to try fine dining again sometime.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	S03eT9BMSO9MQ_DGn_7ryg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

His filet looked so dry and shriveled, I was surprised they served it. There was no "essence" only a lot of salt. He chocked it down because he didn't want to disappoint me. I had the chicken breast with fingerling potatoes and onion sauce. Someone must have shaked a cup of salt over everything. I couldn't tell what I was eating and after a few bites said  I wanted to save room for dessert.\nIn all fairness, the service was excellent and the decor classy and not over done. The only thing we enjoyed was the chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream.\nWe live here and have had some very good meals at a few restaurants on the Strip, but would NEVER go to another Emril restaurant.

Rkj1-DFdh_9mnSCnaRIYaw	5	2009-04-22 00:00:00	Delmonico's is easily a 5-star restaurant, but not because there is a famous name (Emeril Lagasse) associated with the restaurant -- but because the food is simply exceptional. This is fine dining without the pretentiousness of stuffy, overpriced, mini-portion restaurants. \n\nWe happened to be staying at the Venetian Hotel & Casino and made reservations to Delmonico's, which is on the premises. There was about a 1-minute wait and we were quickly whisked away to a candlelit table. The restaurant itself is very simple yet elegant; nothing over the top, flashy or obnoxious. The lighting is perfect; not too dark and the wait staff is extremely attentive and prompt.\n\nDelmonico's is known for their steak; the bone-in rib eye steak. This slab of meat is prime and comes with a nice price tag. If you're at Delmonico's -- ya might as well go for it, chump!\n\nFor starters, I had the Lobster Bisque Soup; thick, creamy and packed with flavor. I absolutely loved it! Best Lobster Bisque I have ever had. It came adorned with a polenta type cake in the middle. I am not sure if it was polenta or dried shrimp cake -  or even bread, but it didn't matter as it all happily made its way down my belly. \n\nWe also tried the crab meat cake; fresh chunks of crab atop a puff pastry and dressed with tomatoes, lima beans, asparagus and all sorts of good spring veggies. Amazing! \n\nI decided to try the Rack of Lamb with the Twice Baked Potatoes. Jeff went with the Rib Eye Steak and Baked Potato. The Lamb was head-spinning! Topped with a rich sauce and truffles! Perfectly cooked and moist and tender and gaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhh! I can't rave enough. The steak was just as good -- even the fatty pieces were delicious. \n\nThe food, the service, the atmosphere, the attention to detail, the $25 corking fee -- all was worth the price. Definitely a place to experience while out in SIN CITY!	7	6	7	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	pI44KNBxtO_BeYM8KVx9BQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

They definitely know how to cook their steak, a medium rare is true medium rare. For the sides we shared creamed spinach, shrimp, asparagus, and potatoes. \n\nSince Vegas gets busy, you definitely need reservations.

rNR8uTCAhvxQV-979B7G-w	2	2008-12-11 00:00:00	I'll start by saying that the ribeye steak I had at Delmonico's was the best that I've ever had, hands down. Even the sides that my fiance and I split: smashed potatos, and asparagus-- were top notch. It's too bad that such an awesome culinary experience had to be ruined by everything else.\n\nFirst off: the decor. VERY spare, with high ceilings. Kind of felt like I was eating in a fancied up gymnasium. The dining room was dark but the sparse spot lighting was harsh, taking away any sort of mellow ambiance they hoped to achieve.\n\nAbout 5 minutes after we were seated, a party of 7 very loud middle aged men came into the restaurant and sat at the table next to us. My fiance and I only ordered salad and dinner, and soda to drink since we don't pay for booze in Vegas. ;) This OTHER table was ordering bottles of wine and appetizers out the wazoo, and the waitstaff took the cue to ignore us and focus on the table that certainly ensured a bigger tip.\n\nThis was a HUGE turnoff. We are very lowkey customers by nature -- no substitutions, no special requests -- I waited tables during my college years so I know what it's like to be on the other side of things. But to sit there for 10 minutes with empty plates and glasses in front of us while 4 or so staffmembers fell over each other at the adjacent table uncorking bottles, getting out appetizers... it was unacceptable. It made us feel like intruders with our lowly $130 bill.\n\nPLUS, they charged us for soda refills? at $2.00 a pop. If I'm paying $50 for a steak, don't charge me for a stupid refill of Diet Coke.\n\nThe meal itself was awesome, but with so many other options in Vegas to choose from, we probably won't be going back. I was happier with the French Toast Slam I had at Denny's earlier in the day: No pretension, my waiter didn't suck, and I didn't get charged for a refill.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	1PaEnmMlndFCKAMfXknW7A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Expensive - of course.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AIPDUOD-Hx-J5DVrze43Cw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
RqMPApD6ileASFe8pJEdWg	5	2017-07-23 00:00:00	Bam!  Emeril has done it again with his delicious steakhouse, Delmonico, located on the casino floor in restaurant row at the Venetian in Las Vegas.  We celebrated my sister's birthmonth and she received a complimentary note and ice cream dessert.  We started the night with a buttered crostini with salami on top, compliments of the chef.  We ordered the grilled octopus and bbq shrimps as appetizers, both were very tasty and prepared our tastebuds for the scintilating steak.  For sides, we had the buttered asparagus, mushrooms with multiple types, and duckfat fingerling potatos.  I had a bone-in rib eye that was well done with herb butter adorning the top which slowly seeped through the tender cut and infused the meat juices to provide for an even more flavorful bite.  For dessert we had Emeril's banana cream pie and the caramel butter cake, both so decadent and sweet, what a way to end a meal:)  The servers were very attentive and efficient.  The restroom, though it was a long hallway away and only had 2 stalls, was clean and well kept.  The ambience was classy and loud in some areas due to the archways and cavernous ceilings reminiscent of a wine cellar.  The dinner was very satisfying and the whole experience was an example of Emeril's excellence.  Thank you Delmonico Steakhouse for becoming one of my favorite strips of steak on the Las Vegas Strip!	6	4	5	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Tu0xZqGMIbJ_RrV4S5P07w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
RQpwOsmDMGJLLtaQLB66gA	5	2007-08-03 00:00:00	Food: Definitely one of the best steakhouses I have ever been to....you're getting quality good meat and service here.  I tried the filet mignon which was delicious and tasty. I also tried a side of potatoes and string beans which was also great. Also the soup of the day: black bean and roasted pork was to die for!Tasted just like homemade chili!Also the trio of homemade ice cream was wonderful.\n\nService: Service here is outstanding. The waiters are very prompt and professional.\n\nLocation: Located in the Venetian\n\nAtmosphere: Loved it, very relaxing and intimate.\n\nPrice: Expensive, but not too bad considering the quality and quantity of food.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	fccMIyBd6ZhFUVAhvSqsrw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
RQvZLCH3SMRhV4GRRL8Yvg	5	2017-06-15 00:00:00	This was my best meal of the week during a week of great meals in Las Vegas.  Delmonico's is Emeril LaGasse's take on a modern American steakhouse.  For my money, Emeril nails it.  The service here was excellent.  The atmosphere was American classic.  The noise level was moderate.  We were able to have a very good conversation where the whole table of 6 was engaged the entire time.  The cocktail menu was imaginative and the Old Fashioned's tasted nearly as good as mine.  The wine list was interesting and navigated well by one of my work colleagues.  The popovers to start as the bread option was a nice touch.  Popovers were "a thing" in my youth, my Mom loved them, and for me it's always sweet to have them in a restaurant.  For my entree I had the filet mignon and it was perfect.  Others in our party had the bone in rib eye and the bone in sirloin ... all were happy.  We ordered 3/4 of the sides on the menu and all were well done.   We all ordered dessert and 1/2 the table went with the banana cream pie and the other 1/2 with key lime, both were good, but the key lime was the winner.  The net-net for this Yelper is that I would be happy to go back here anytime.  Delmonico rates 5 stars and two thumbs up.	3	2	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	581NruH_Ns8_FH7jr9wLiQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
rRJkogsrLBXCDg2Wh7TETg	5	2016-11-28 00:00:00	I have yet to have a bad meal here.  Have eaten here many times.  I usually make it a point to order their Rib-eye but on this particular visit, due to it being lunch hour, I ordered the Big Eye Tuna salad.  It was damn delish.  Afterwards I got my sweet tooth on with their sorbet mix (mango/strawberry/raspberry).  The only way to make the sorbet any better was if I was sitting in a comfy recliner with a warm blanky on me.\n\nBack to the Rib-eye.  I don't eat red meat often but this place rocks a mean steak.  I save my red meat Jonesing while in Vegas for eating here.  It's (Trump voice) YUGE!  If I manage to finish the steak, I'm hurting.  Meat sweats type hurting...  Best to share.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	bOOkl1hnLL5chpnZz0A89Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
RRUbeX2hjNmszwZRBe_AzA	4	2009-10-04 00:00:00	Service is to die for! Ambiance not so much. Floor molding and walls were dirty. Its filet mignon is very basic and if you expect flavor its not for you.

rT1Qwvx_-QWjjF44WT-wCw	5	2013-06-24 00:00:00	This was the second time Joe and I had diner at Delmonico's steakhouse located in the Palazzo hotel and it did not disappoint.  We were seated promptly when we arrived, the meal started with a mushroom and creme cheese pastry.  Even though I do not care for either ingredient I finished my whole thing!\n\nAll dishes were beautifully presented, perfectly seasoned and dressed,\nand absolutely delicious.  The service here was impeccable. We had multiple servers and they all worked as a team. We never had to ask for anything because they were always on top of it.  \n\nHere is an example of the service, Joe was debating between two dessert wines after deciding on one, and they also brought him a sample of the other option.\nBam! Great service, great food and great atmosphere!\n\nFor pictures visit my blog at http://staci.writesthisblog.com/index.php/vegas-trip-delmonico-s-steakhouse/	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	n99bWrY9Nnj2ydZTdqwWOg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
rU7a5-cqM6PsTSYqOGRbVw	4	2014-06-21 00:00:00	My friends hyped this place up so much this time in Vegas that I walked in with super high expectations, which unfortunately did not hold.\n\nWhile the service was great, so were the breads, their cocktails were nothing to write home about and their wine selection was rigid - I had the Hemingway drink and it was alright.\n\nThe food was good - I had the tuna which was really good on itself, but the sauce was terrible. The sides were not bad. Our server really hyped up the creamed corn, which came much later and I did not see what the big deal was about. It was again just ok.\n\nThe desserts were pretty good, our table enjoyed them. I ordered the bread pudding ala mode and having had the some spectacular bread puddings recently, I did not think this was anything amazing but still not bad.\n\nOne thing to mention though - because our server had forgotten our last side order, it was on the house. tells you alot about the quality of service at this place.\n\nI probably will try out other options on the strip before coming back here. Given that it's Vegas, there are some really good options. Unfortunately Delmonico wasn't a super memorable experience for me, but for a well-made dinner in a nice restaurant, this place is spot on.	2	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	FMkXaQ8W1eJlp6sBGYS6QQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I would skip this restaurant altogether.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	-9Wnr-QvOeDfuIRyaH6VRQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
rwfKOGeIjRJbyfx-WzwfLA	5	2015-03-28 00:00:00	Outside of the steak I ordered being slightly raw by the bone, which the manager notice and resolved. This place was perfection. I normally do not give any place 5 stars but after being here two nights in a row with constant experiences, I am confident in my review. \n\nOnly complaint. The ceiling in the main dining room has arched contours, which causes you to be able to hear clear as day the conversation of a table 20 feet away when sitting in the right position. Which apparently I was. I could even hear the sidebar whispers.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	9jKVGPGe46V6emkzP7LZwQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
rx2xAO__LAw_O5O07LnY9Q	3	2009-10-09 00:00:00	Emeril, I am dissapointed!\nI know you have many many restaurants to take care of, but it's your name that I trusted. I'd rather you not have 4 restaurants in Vegas but 1 really great restaurant.\n\nI picked to go to Delmonico for  my bday lunch since I had other plans for dinner, and the fact that I love a good steak.  We arrived around 11ish and the place was dead. The service was just not good, even on a quiet day like this?!\n\nWe got sitted. Waiter wasn't rude but wasn't friendly and seemed like he doesn't want to be there. He came when we were ready to order, soups and entrees and a side, then he turned to leave, but I reminded him that we haven't ordered our drinks.   The drinks are usually the first thing servers asked!!\n\nWe were left alone in an empty quiet room. We got our bread from a different guy, who was a little friendlier.  But it drove me nuts because everytime he would put a roll on our plates, it was upside down.  The little round fluffy bread was facing downwards twice! I know it's not a big deal, but for the price of dining here, I expect a little more attention to details from the servers. And the butter was still frozen.\n\nMy Lobster Bisque was pretty yummie. But my Filet Mignon was just average. I had to add more salt and pepper to it.  For half the price, I could get a better tasting Filet Mignon at home.\n\nMy bf on the other hand had the burger, it was gigantic and very tasty. I wished I had gotten the burger instead, and it was much cheaper too.\nIt wasn't the size of the meal that I was looking for, but a tasty meal with the service in par with the price we pay.\n\nSo in the end, my steak chowing experience at Emeril's famous steakhouse was dissapointing and tasted average. If only the service were superb, it would have changed the whole experience of dining here, but unfortunately the service wasn't there either.\n\nEven as we paid the check and was walking out, the lady at the front desk said thank you but was looking elsewhere, why bother?	4	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	o83QcIRyWBznec4Shzg04A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
rX6tv6gMmT5b_I92pSoARA	5	2017-06-17 00:00:00	Seriously good stuff!!\n\n3 of us dined here on a Thursday night. It didn't look crowded from the outside, but once we went back into the dining area, we were shocked by how huge it is and how crowded it was.  We had a lovely table and great service.  But more importantly, seriously stellar food.\n\nPer usual in my world, my group ordered a bunch of things to share.  (I don't know why everyone doesn't do this- it just makes dining so much more fun).  ORDER THE FILET MIGNON!!! The seasoning is insanely delicious- sort of a creole/Cajun/NOLA seasoning profile that danced in my mouth.  High quality, beautiful cut of steak, perfectly cooked with a unique flavor profile-- how can you go wrong??  Also, our awesome server sliced it for us to make it easy to share-- loved that!! \n\nThe salmon was also perfectly cooked and delicious.  The hash underneath was great too, and played well with the fish seasoning.  The mushrooms side is OUTSTANDING!  If you are a mushroom lover, these are some don't-miss shroomies.  We also got the buttered broccoli.  It is totally simple and tasted like what you'd have at home, but with such a heavy and strong flavored meal, this was some spot on, solid freshness, too.  No complaints from me!!\n\nI also would be remiss not to point out the flakey, fresh, OMG-good bread that they serve.  So light and airy, so so worth the calories.\n\nThis is definitely a restaurant I will return too- which is saying a lot in Vegas where the food is just too good!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	RBIpuTC-V2H3RGtgh6ALnQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
rXOCQg0SAnUYFzqOvwgQPQ	5	2009-07-16 00:00:00	Emeril knows his steaks!  I went here 2 nights in a row (1) business dinner with clients (2) took my bf out for his bday.  Both times were excellent, did not disappoint.  Well, the business dinner was actually better since I didn't have to pay!  When in Vegas, you must indulge, so why not here - the service is top notch, the food is to die for.  Wonderfully cooked steaks, the sides are awesome.  Dessert was also great. \n\nFunny story - there was a group of about 6 older gentlemen at the table next to us.  We had already paid (I paid) and were just about to leave and they asked me to take their photo.  They said they were on their yearly guys trip, and wanted a photo.  After I took their picture, one of the guys said I did a "good thing" back there when he saw me paying for us :)  He said I was "a good woman." \n\nOne gripe - for our business dinner, we had a party of about 16 and they sat us at 2 tables in the main dining area.  That kind of stunk because we wanted to sit all together so we could all chat, but we had to split up, it was a little uncomfortable.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Rf9LV9Ha8OYkRQCFYjxLNA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We then had the steak for 2- huge cut! They came with these puff pastry popovers that also had a great buttery spread on it, accompanied by the seared foie grad add-on. Heaven. \n\nGreat classic steakhouse.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	aN4BozWLJVvBEMS49GQWiw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
RzGWoJReZ9Y6maHDmPvIoA	4	2011-09-23 00:00:00	4.5 out of 5 Stars.  Being an Emeril Lagasse restaurant, you had to expect the best.  \n\nOne of my previous reviews of an expensive steakhouse stated that I could not imagine paying outrageous prices for a steak considering there are only so many ways that you can prepare it.  With that being said I still believe that is true, however I did not pay for my dinner this night since it was for Business :).  \n\nDelmonico's is located in The Venetian Resort and Casino right across from the Mirage.  I have always thought the Venetian was one of the more classy places to go in Vegas and Delmonico's was no different.  We called ahead to put our names in for an 8:00pm reso but we got there early at 7.  Some of us were dressed in shorts and flip flops, but since it was Vegas I think thats why we got away with it.  After checking in they said they could seat us early and to take a seat at the bar to relax.  After ordering a few drinks, we were seated promptly by a very friendly hostess.  (On a side note, they have an extensive Scotch list which includes some very rare 100 yr old Scotch's for $150-200 a pop).  We sat down towards the kitchen and was greeted by a stunning blonde waitress...I believe her name was Dale, but I could be mistaken.  \n\nWe took a look at the menu and this place is not cheap.  You are looking at around 50 bucks for a steak.  Most of us ordered the Ribeye which is my favorite cut of meat and you can either get it bone-in or not bone-in...22oz or 16oz respectively. We started off with BBQ shrimp which is what they are known for and Ahi Tuna and Salmon Tartare.  Both of these were fantastic.  Our steaks came out quickly and they were cooked perfectly.  The sides here are a la carte and each could easily feed at least 4 people.  We got the garlic mashed potatoes and it too was quite delicious.\n\nAll in all this place was amazing....They have a team of people, 3 to a table, to make sure your water is always filled, bread is on your plate, and that you have everything you would need.  \n\nI was mesmerized by our waitress and was inspired to tell her that she was stunningly beautiful.  She was an excellent waitress too haha.  \n\nIf you are looking for a good restaurant in Vegas I would definitely give this one a try.  Be prepared to spend some money, but it was well worth it.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ftc_8owTar2a9BVrX0EKig	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
rZR4ohRh6QcClOwpEgwtFg	5	2010-06-11 00:00:00	My boyfriend and I decided to eat one expensive meal in Vegas and chose Delmonico Steakhouse based on the Yelp reviews.  Yelpers know what they are talking about...the food was amazing!!!\n\nWe made reservations using OpenTable and when we arrived, they seated us towards the back of the restaurant and had already removed the extra 2 chairs at our table.  I was impressed!!  Most of the time, even if you make reservations, the restaurant still has to move the chairs and get the table ready.  Not Delmonico!  They were ready for us.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of white wine (even though I was having steak).  I don't remember what wine we had but it was good, even though it was a cheaper bottle.\n\nFor dinner, we started with the Caesar salad that they make tableside.  I'm not much of a Caesar salad fan but the boyfriend loves it.  The Caesar salad from Delmonico was amazing!  It tasted so fresh and crisp and the 'homemade' dressing was so good!\n\nFor entrees, the boyfriend ordered the pork chops and I ordered the filet mignon medallions.  We also shared a side of asparagus.  All of our food was excellent!  \n\nJust as an FYI, the pork chops were served with a side of mashed sweet potatoes (which I love!) but that wasn't mentioned on the menu.  The boyfriend kindly gave me the sweet potatoes in exchange for 1/2 of one of my filet medallions.\n\nSpeaking of the medallions, one of the top 5 steaks of my life!  I grew up in Oklahoma on a ranch where we had our own personal meat locker...so for me to say that Delmonico's filet medallions are one of the best I've ever tasted, that's definitely saying something!\n\nUnfortunately, we were too full for dessert but thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Delmonico.\n\nJust as a side note, the rolls before dinner are real dinner rolls with yeast!  I hate restaurants that serve dry, crusty rolls.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	9e6OFd4vjuUX4R87PjaGUg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
S2awovXHGWAxeAcwdJQs6A	5	2013-06-11 00:00:00	Went here for lunch while in Las vegas on June 4, 2013.  Fabulous service, definitely a first class place.  My girlfriend and I started with the caesar salad which was just wonderful, great flavor and presentation.  We then both went with the steak sandwich with truffle oil fries.  The steak sandwich though not huge was extremely delicious and I mean EXTREMELY delicious.  Everything that went into it was perfect, the spinach, the mushrooms, the grilled chibata, the horseradish mayo, and the wonderful juicy perfectly cooked steak.  It is a bit pricey at $18, but definitely worth the price in my opinion.  The fries weren't anything special and were a bit over cooked.  The setting was nice, but the restaurant was empty and all the guests dining were confined to the front dining room.  Overall great meal, and I will be a repeat customer when back in town.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Surt9-WWtiauEVS6g8_cuQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
s31EJGwccCMGeXjHEVZSng	3	2011-05-19 00:00:00	Great ambiance. Great Service. things we ordered 3.5\n\n-Emeril's New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp: This was not good. I would have rather had just shrimp and salt.\n-Ahi Tuna & Salmon Tartare: This was average. It was tasty, I enjoyed it but nothing stood out from it. \n-Truffle and Parmesan Potato Chips: Guys at our table couldn't get enough of it. It was really good. The truffle oil was amazing!\n-Caesar Salad Prepared Tableside for Two: This was okay. It was kinda cool they made it for you on the side fresh. Small portion for the cost.\n\n-Bone-in Ribeye: This was very juicy, had tons of flavor. There were some spots where it was very chewy but still very good.  The portion size was very big. Some of the guys could not finish it.\n-New Orleans Creamed Spinach- I didnt like it at first but I acquired the taste and thought it was tasty by the last bite I had.\n-Creamed Corn Gratinée - VERY GOOD. first item to go at our table\nSautéed Garlic Wild Mushrooms- great mushrooms, hard to mess it up. but a good compliment to the steak\n\n-Pecan Pie - First off I like pecna\n-Emeril's Banana Cream Pie - This was good one of the better banana cream pie I had, but the pecan pie was just too good that this just tasted alright.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	_hkkTz2WRZhNUur2nDTroA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
S43qIUQyDeYZ8ofWZfakuA	4	2008-05-12 00:00:00	TIP ON ORDERING STEAK:\nIf you want a bigger cut of meat, get it rare to medium-rare.  \nOtherwise, if you order your meat medium-well, you get a smaller cut in order for it to cook well in the middle\n\nI couldn't decide on a steak that night, and I wanted a little variety.  So I ordered a combination of 2 appetizers and a soup.\n\nSoup: Lobster bisque was awesome mainly because they weren't stingy with the lobster meat.  Often when you order a seafood soup (e.g. clam chowder) they dump a lot of potatoes or other filling in there.  Not the case with this bisque.  A must for any bisque or lobster connoisseur.\n\nAppetizer 1: Butternut squash ravioli w/duck was very tasty, and again, not stingy with the duck, which kind of looked like pulled pork but with duck meat.\n\nAppetizer 2: Crawfish meat w/Crystal pepper sauce over linguine could have been a small meal in itself.  And just the right amount of that Crystal Hot Sauce to give it a solid Southern kick.  This was probably my favorite.\n\nI did have a taste of the various meats too including the T-bone and filet mignon, both of which I recommend.  You don't get anything with it, so unless you just want meat, you'll probably need to order a side dish or two.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	VzVsgEkIrvsMcrO6xbS5Zg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I ordered it medium rare and found it to be on the dry side. It was also not that hot, same goes for my baked potato. My main entree could have been  served hotter, but I guess since we were in a large group, our food just ended up that way. \n\nI really liked the spinach & frisée salad, tuna & salmon tartare, and the creme brûlée was very good. The raspberry sorbet was bland and didn't taste that flavorful.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	W-sq3lr18TNcfAwKjzU5Jw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

S7AZEIANtFh4hI3c1eS0Rg	5	2015-11-15 00:00:00	Wow! New favorite spot in Vegas. The Bone-in Ribeye is a lot of steak for the money, we'll marbled, and cooked to a perfect "rare-medium-rare." It was so damn good, but I had to cut and give away slivers around the table. I could've easily split that plate with a salad and the fried oyster app (which was eerily reminiscent of Commanders Palace in N.O.)\n\nI had a bite of the salmon with that sweet chili BBQ sauce which was buttery soft and very tasty. It was a nice contrast to the Fred Flintstone size steak. I also tried some of the grilled cheese dipped into the Tomato Bisque. Whoa, what a rush of flavors. The cream spinach was really good. More texture from the spinach than usual with the perfect balance of cream. Asparagus had just the right texture too. How will I eat dessert?\n\nBanana Cream Pie, that's how. IT'S DIVINE! You must try it. Polly and Marie be damned. This tall towering pie can be shared 3 or 4 ways, but you must go vertical. Cut a slab, drag it through the caramel sauce, slather it with cream, and throw it on your plate. Don't leave here without a cross-section of all its layered goodness. Look how happy my friend Lauren P. from San Diego was when it came.\n\nComing back fo sho. Emeril, you kick ass. BAM!	3	1	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	va0qGk12X4Wy3qF9JtVcTg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
saLQQOFvjYXCCC4siEnYqw	5	2012-01-17 00:00:00	HOLY hell. This place was yummy\n\nAwesome thing, no split plate charges. My gfs and I were not yearning to eat a 22 oz steak, so it was nice to be able to split the entrees. We ordered the bone-in rib eye. YOU MUST ORDER that, especially if you're a steak eater. Medium rare, and that's how steak should always be. We also tried the Grilled Filet Mignon Medallions, which we overdone, Medium Rare my a$$, it was more like medium well-well done. but it did have a good taste. I don't believe in returning food.\n\nThe creamed corn was the shiznit. It was soooooo good. And the asparagus was good too, tender and perfectly buttered. \n\nOf course I can't skip dessert, had the creme brulee, which as ok. A bit too much sugar on top, but overall not bad. We had a bday and was given banana sorbet - gross. :P But the brioche bread pudding w/ bourbon and ice cream. was to die for. SOOOOO delish. :D\n\nI will return for the truffle potato chips. :D and rib eye!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	SLHeaGvcew77mpermtd3Ag	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The bread they serve here is the most atrocious bread ever. It is similar to a croissant shaped like a muffin. It looks like it would be delicious, but it is so greasy and is worse than day old croissants from your cheap grocery store. The only saving grace of this night was the ribeye steak,  which was really fantastic, as was the sea bass. The special prime bone in was pretty terrible - we asked for medium and got well done. Don't even get me started on the salad with the greasiest non-olive oil dressing... yuck! They were also kind of confused when I asked for vinegar to eat the salad..	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	3ySZDkok1bH7uP-r3by2Ww	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
seeQ3tXlK6TGm1qMzAaD9Q	5	2012-04-11 00:00:00	Emeril's Delmonico Steakhouse is located in the Venetian hotel, slightly across from the Blue Man Group Theatre. To be honest, I even liked Chef Emeril much. Never cared about his shows or his cooking. Guess he made me a believer after this one night dining at Delmonico. We made reservations through Open Table for a party of 12 on a Saturday night. We wanted 6:30pm but were only given the options of 5pm or 9pm (FYI, reservations were made about two weeks in advance). We weren't about to pig out then hit the night life scene all bloated and passing gas so we settled for 5pm which worked out anyways. Gave us plenty of time to digest and chill. \n\nWe checked in with the three pretty hostesses and were offered to have a seat in their lounge area until our table was ready. Barely five minutes passed and our maître d' came out to fetch us. Unfortunately, he wasn't as easy on the eyes as the hostess. However, he took care of us the entire night. I apologize for not remembering his name because he's worth mentioning and deserve recognition: Caucasian, arrogant looking but very proper and attentive, and had a dark humor side to him. \n\nThe establishment is quite simple but still very classy. It's dimly lit for you romantic types; unfortunately this was a bromance between 12 obnoxious dudes. The dining rooms and distance between tables were spacious enough so you're able to have some sort of privacy. You can tell that they didn't try to over do the interior design of the place. It's an elegant and clean look.\n\nWe all decided to bypass appetizers and drinks and just went straight for the entrees and side dishes. We figured we'll be pounding enough booze later on the night. After recently having some awesome buffalo in Wyoming, I decided to order the Three Peppercorn Crusted American Buffalo Rib-eye with Caramelized Cipollini Onions and Brandy Peppercorn reduction ($50). For those of you who are already raising an eyebrow, this chunk of meat was by far gamey. It well cooked, very tender, and seemed to have less fat that then regular bone in rib eye. Personally, medium rare is the way to go. I sampled the bone in rib eye from my friend's plate and I have to say that the buffalo is the unanimous winner. A few of the other guys who are traditional beef carnivores decided to try the buffalo also agreed that the buffalo was well worth the try. Not to dock the rib eye because that was still very legit.\n\nFor sides, we ordered two of the following to share: Sautéed Garlic Wild Mushrooms ($11), New Orleans Creamed Spinach ($9), and the Creamed Corn Gratinee ($11). It was the perfect amount of sides for the entire table, not over killing it yet a decent amount for each person. All sides were very delish and complimented our meals perfectly.\n\nEverything could not have gone smoother. The 12 of us had a nice corner to ourselves. Service was top notch. Occasionally, they brought out 4-5 servers at once to present all the entrees to us all at the same time. Our drinks never ran dry and we were always checked up on every so often. The chef even sent out a sampling which was ground duck rice ball in a sweet and sour sauce. That could've easily been an appetizer order all together and we would've happily ordered it. Even the pricing was quite affordable considering the caliber of the steak house Delmonico is. I am quite impressed with what Chef Emeril has done with this restaurant. Big Props to him and the entire staff for an outstanding meal. I do look forward to future visits.	4	3	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	tXqVduTJHLbrrwVEO8JX6w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

sg4rGSKpS2KG4_XwW1Vrzg	3	2007-02-07 00:00:00	I will admit as I write this review that I am not the target clientele for Delmonico's. I don't eat red meat and Delmonico's is a steakhouse. I went with a group for a friend's birthday, but wasn't concerned about finding food because I've never been to a steakhouse that doesn't have at least one fantastic chicken or fish option. Umm...I found that place. The only non-red meat option on the menu was a bacon-wrapped halibut and I don't eat pork either (I know, I'm annoying). I asked if I could have the halibut without bacon and they told me they would have to unwrap it, but sure. Which meant my ridiculously expensive dinner consisted of a dry rock which might have once been halibut that tasted strongly of bacon. Now, I know it was a steakhouse and I shouldn't hold it against them that they aren't prepared to deal with a semi-vegetarian, but they should at least be prepared to make halibut that doesn't have the consistency of a rock. And I also wasn't impressed with the service. They got down the whole 8 waiters at a time delivering everybody's food thing, but our waiter wasn't particularly knowledgeable about the wine or the menu, except to push "Emeril's specialties." And seeing as how Emeril isn't actually back there, I don't really care what are his specialities. The decor does make the most of an underground space, but the lack of windows made me genuinely claustrophobic by the end of the night. Overall, I was really dissapointed. I'd give it one star, but I don't think that's fair because, again, I'm not their target audience. But that doesn't mean I'm not paying as much as everybody else!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	_OdkmjDV-L4w9Z89tmW-EQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
sGRVybkrx9rCR-aGKnoeqg	4	2009-02-11 00:00:00	This was a dinner for work.. not sure if I'd pay for it on my own dime, but it was excellent! Service was excellent. The sommelier even happily took back a $120 bottle of wine (guess that's cheap by Vegas standards!) when the 2nd bottle smelled corked. \n\nAppetizers:\n*butternut squash ravioli - recommended if you love duck! Covered in duck confit.. yummy!\n*BBQ shrimp - sauce was rich, heavy and delish. It was almost a combination of a gumbo base and bbq sauce\n*foie gras with berry tart (on the daily specials menu) - wow! if you follow my reviews, you know I'm a foie gras lover, but this one was really excellent. The crossed grill marks on it were beautiful\n\nMain course:\n*Bone in ribeye - 18 oz of buttery tasty goodness. Well seasoned. Not best steak I've had in my life material, but quite good.\n*Ahi tuna - huge portion! Cooked to perfection, but the enormous slabs were kind of off putting. I guess when you're paying $42 for freaking tuna you should get something substantial. Plus it makes you feel more like your steak eating companions to have this retarded big portion on your plate.\n\nSides:\n*just get the truffle chips.. you will thank me later!\n*grits covered in bacon couldn't get more fatty :) No complaints here\n\nDessert:\n*chocolate bread pudding - very chocolatey!\n*butterscotch pudding - good but honestly the freebie portion at Bradley Ogden is yummier!!	4	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
SHu0YvqhizULZlhDcpj-Wg	3	2009-08-24 00:00:00	is it okay not to rave about this place? apologies to emeril. i think you're cool. really, i do.\n\nvisited the land of sin about a month ago and went to dinner at Delmonico. i was impressed with the steak, but extremely underwhelmed with the appetizers and sides.\n\nshared a new york strip steak, cooked medium rare, with a friend. de-f'ing-licious. i didn't really like or crave steak until a recent trip to puerto rico (a food story for another time) but now i think i've learned to appreciate the awesomeness of a giant hunk of meat. the waiter was nice enough to split the steak onto two places, and it was sooooo good.\n\nhowever.\nthe appetizers and sides were another story.\n\n- truffle parmesan potato chips - supposedly a specialty, but i found these too oily (yea yea, i know. truffle oil.) and too rich.\n- bbq shrimp w/ rosemary biscuit - came with 4 (i think) sizable shrimp, but i found it too salty, and really nothing special.\n- creamed spinach - very ehhhh. i've had better.\n- sauteed garlic mushrooms - okay, so you can't go wrong with garlic & mushrooms. these were a bit oily too, but pretty good none-the-less.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	V_597tLGoIPHsb43gLAVwg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
sIp8RVnrgAonQj2mEhitVg	2	2012-06-24 00:00:00	My wife wanted to take me to a special place for my 50th birthday, and she chose Delmonico.  Overall, it was a bit of a disappointment.\n\nThe food:\nWe started off with the shrimp, which was wonderful, and the bread was warm and soft.  It was a bit salty for my taste, but that's just me.  We then had the spinach salad, which was wonderful!  For entrees, I had the crab stuffed lobster and the wife had the filet.  The lobster was great; the filet was nothing special.  For dessert, we had a sorbet and the cheesecake; both were quite good.\n\nThe waiters/staff:\nIf I had to use one word, it would be disinterested. The waiter was good, but the other (why were there two?) just seemed to be reading a script and literally had to read his notes on the available dessert flavors.  The wife had informed them it was my 50th birthday, but when the dessert came out it said "Happy Anniversary".  We jokingly noted the error and the waiter said we didn't appear to be old enough to be married for 50 years, but he went with what he was told.  We didn't blame him at all and left a generous tip. This error underscore their lack of attention and appearance of just going through the motions.\n\nSo, overall, it was OK, but not great.  We've had better steaks, and FAR better service (Ferraro's Italian Restaurant waiter was the BEST) for much less cost.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	nyFNziIAAUfgZB400_4-ZQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

sLCPgbt4p_q36ieNjcd4CQ	2	2013-02-07 00:00:00	I was part of a group of six people having a business dinner and was really looking forward eating at this establishment. The service was very good and noise level was acceptable wherein it was easy to carry on a conversation.  I had the BBQ shrimp as my appetizer which was very good.  But as to the main entree, I was very disappointed in the quality of the NY strip.  This piece of meat was described as prime but in reality I thought it was more of a select grade ... I have had choice from the grocery store that was more tender.  Initially, I thought maybe my steak was an anomaly and did not want to complain since were invited out to dinner. However, then  another person in our party also stated his steak was very tough and was only able to eat about a quarter of his steak ... Gave up and moved on to eat only the side dishes, which were very good I may say.\n\nWe all shared the desserts ... I really enjoyed the Banana Cream pie.\n\nEven though there were some good things about this restaurant still rated it lower based on the poor quality of prime steak I had relative to the cost of the steak ... In essence it still was not worth the dining experience even though I was not the one paying.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	azowXR1ykw0IIvd9xk2Guw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
sMCtsFyCj0a3dfFA1GPcsg	4	2012-05-21 00:00:00	As you walk in, there's an impressive wine cellar that you can see inside of since there's a glass wall.  It made me wish I was into wine.  I ordered the signature rib-eye with a side of wild mushrooms.  The wife ordered the braised beef ribs.\n\nAtmosphere: The wait-staff was nice and the person takimg our order didn't seem to mind that I asked if they had beer (they do) as opposed to ordering a glass of wine.  Lights weren't bright, a bit dim for my liking, but the area was very spacious.\n\nFood:  The steak was cooked perfectly medium-rare, not under, not over, just right.  Nothing fancy for the seasoning, just good old salt and pepper.  A nice seared crust on the outside, nice and tender on the inside.  However, I wouldn't call it the best steak I've ever had, but it was very good.  The wild mushrooms were excellent, I would order those again for sure.  The braised beef ribs were okay, not great.  A bit too salty, but I guess that's why it was on the Specials menu.\n\nPrice:  Well, it's Vegas and it's a nicer restaurant, be prepared to pay.  Frankly, I've paid more for steak, and this wasn't he most expensive steakhouse I've been to.  However, when my wife and I saw the bill, we both said "oh, that's not that bad."\n\nOverall it was a good experience eating there.  If you enjoy steak, you will like this steakhouse.  I'm sure those that enjoy wine with their meals would enjoy this place a bit more than I did though.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	EbVChH6fRbaXfU7TL7JXWg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

This trip was for my boyfriend's birthday, so I wanted something Italian and steak as he requested. This was by far one of the best dinners we have ever had. The food was amazing from salads to lobster bisque to a book of a wine list to the Chateaubriand Carved Tableside for Two, which was basically a filet for two cut into strips at our table. It was superb! It has been 3 months and we're still talking about it! My only issue was that the green salad was too salty. Besides that, the steak and sides were seasoned to perfection. The atmosphere was quiet and as if in a well furnished dry wine cellar; very romantic.\n\nAll in all, it was VERY expensive but worth every penny. I recommend this to anyone looking for a high end romantic steak dinner in Vegas.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4rRh5IRdukRvaCHs1Br6mg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

It came out juicy and perfectly cooked. My complaint would be it lacked seasoning, I had to add salt and pepper, without it, it tasted like it was lacking a little in flavor. I had a glass of wine, and tried a couple of their signature cocktails, a mint juliep drink and a lychee flavored one, both were very good. \n\nOverall a decent meal but did feel a little out of place as we were leaving because me and my friend were both dressed super casual, shorts and a tee, while the rest of the people that had started to show up while we were eating were much more formal.	4	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	vSBfyd4ghB0dEC69rwbc0g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We were pushing the service a little so we could get to Rock of Ages in time so we couldn't enjoy the ambiance as much as we liked.  This is one of the top 3 steakhouses in Las Vegas in my book.

soO-Wo27njLoJdY_Duuy_Q	5	2011-10-03 00:00:00	I decided to take my wife to Las Vegas for our first anniversary.  She'd never been to Las Vegas, but had always wanted to go.  She asked me if we could get dressed up and go somewhere nice one of the nights we were there.  So after doing a little bit of research I stumbled upon Delmonico.  With a name like Emeril Lagasse associated with the place it had to be good right? I went to the website and looked over their menu.  The prices can be very intimidating to someone not used to a fine dining experience.  I really appreciated that the prices were on the menu on the website, because I would not have planned ahead otherwise, and might have choked when I saw them.  However, we only have one first anniversary so I decided we should go for it.  \n\nI called and made a reservation about 5 days in advance, the person on the phone was extremely courteous and helpful.  She asked me if we were celebrating a special occasion.  After I explained it was our first anniversary, she said that she would note it on the reservation.  \n\nWe arrived at Delmonico at about 7:55pm, we had reservations for 8pm.  We were greeted at the front desk by a young woman.  She immediately said "Happy Anniversary" and asked us to have a seat in the lounge.  At about 8:05pm our name was called and we were led back to our table.  A table for four quickly became a table for two.  All the extra silverware, plates, and glasses were whisked away.  The serving staff was beyond courteous, even offering us black napkins due to our clothes being black.  \n\nDrink orders were taken and suddenly a plate was placed in front of us. "Courtesy of the chef, for your anniversary." said the server.  It was a crostini, with slightly cooked piece of beef, some blue cheese dressing, and chives topped with olive oil.  I hate blue cheese but I ate it anyway, and it was quite good.  \n\nThe server asked my wife about wine, and my wife said she liked it but was not very familiar with the types of wine.  The server asked my wife a few questions and came back with a glass of wine my wife loved, and a sample of another kind of wine she might like to have in the future, my wife loved the sample as well.  \n\nWhen it came time to order, my wife order the heirloom tomato appetizer that they have.  It basically sliced heirloom tomatoes with cheese and red onions, drizzled with oil and balsamic.  She loved it.  She also got the Filet Mignon, and buttered asparagus.  Her steak was amazing, I tried a bite of it.  It was cooked perfectly.  It had a little spice to it from the seasoning, all around it was the best Filet Mignon I've ever experienced.  The asparagus was cooked perfectly.  \n\nI ordered the Delmonico signature cut, a bone in Ribeye.  Ribeye is my favorite cut of steak by far.  I've been eating primarily Ribeye for so long it's hard to believe that I was ever happy with other cuts.  I also ordered their take on creamed corn.  The Ribeye was worth the whole trip, it was the by far the best Ribeye I have ever encountered and probably ever will.  It was cooked perfectly.  It had the proper amount of fat that should be expected with a Ribeye.  It was amazing.  The corn was really good also.\n\nOur server then brought us another complimentary dish from the kitchen, cherry sorbet.  Written in chocolate around the outside of the bowl was "Happy Anniversary".  It was pretty good, I'm not a big sorbet person, however please remember, it was free.  \n\nEven with the complimentary dessert my wife and I couldn't pass up a chance to try one of the menu dessert items.  We chose butterscotch Creme Brulee.  It came with 3 butterscotch/chocolate chip cookies on the side.  It was amazing, and probably our new standard for Creme Brulee.\n\nAll in all our experience was awesome.  The food was outstanding and the service was great.  My glass never got empty.  Every time I finished a dinner roll another roll was promptly placed on the plate in it's place.  After the 2nd or 3rd roll, I looked over towards my wife, grinning.  The server saw this and quietly said with a smile on her face, "You know that is going to keep happening." I told my wife that when I was over the rolls, I probably needed to leave a bite on the plate to avoid a new roll. It was funny.  \n\nI would recommend Delmonico to anyone who is in Vegas and looking for a great place to go.  I would encourage anyone who does go to go with the expectation or a fantastic meal.  I think if you go in with the idea of being critical, you will probably find something to complain about, as the couple at the next table did.  They had multiple issues, and sent a few things back to the kitchen.  Remember that food preparation is an art not a science, and enjoy.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	5cvMWjZn98DbaS2XrOnrTw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
sqkqbPfnQL67LsOUtPqizQ	2	2017-01-31 00:00:00	We started with some lobster bisque that was very good.  The rolls were just OK.  My bone in ribeye was very disappointing.  The outside was heavily charred.  The cut itself had much thicker sections of fat than any ribeye I have ever ordered.  After removing most of the carbonized surface, I finally was able to try the meat below.  It tasted like a regular steak.  Not prime, and it lacked the tang of an aged steak.  They told me it was wet aged 3 weeks and dry aged 4 weeks.  I find this hard to believe.  The service was quite excellent and the only reason they are getting 2 stars.  That's twice now I've felt cheated dining at prime steakhouses on the strip.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Wu-B5xzz_kFlm4FXM29QVw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Ssjd9FyPOAZq76OpnKBBlg	3	2016-07-31 00:00:00	Really wish I could give this a higher review but with all the competitive steakhouses in Vegas, steakhouses need to be TOP notch.\n\nOur server was pretty inattentive. Took about 10-15 minutes to receive a wine/cocktail menu. Server was friendly though. Popup bread (complimentary) was delicious! We ordered off of the prix fix menu. Make sure you ask the server for this menu because it's only listed on a sign outside but not found anywhere on the menu. I had the tomato soup with ricotta grilled cheese. By far, best tomato soup I have ever had. My boyfriend and I also ordered different types of steaks. We ordered them to be cooked medium rare. His came out perfect- pink all the way through, juicy tender. However, mine was VERY rare- like almost a shade of blue. For a steakhouse, this is VERY disappointing. The other issue with this is after we received our food no one checked in and it took a while for me to flag down one of our servers (we had three servers/workers for our table). So my boyfriend was almost done with his steak before we were even checked on and received a new one. Manager did come over and apologize for but a steakhouse in Vegas, I feel the temperature of a steak has to be on point. \n\nFor desserts, we ordered the pecan pie. I don't even like pecan pie and it was DELICIOUS. I was pretty disappointment with my caramel butter cake. Cake was very dry but the sauce on the bottom was EXCELLENT. \n\nOverall, okay place to have dinner. But due to the inattentive service and not consistent steak temperatures, I would consider another steak house that is more consistent.	0	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	THTLJpritqKSYL0axeij5A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
SsNhCAhpKjIQYPCbdTFgpA	5	2008-07-10 00:00:00	Incredible service! Made a reservation even though it was after 4th of July weekend. I was glad we had one, it was still packed on a monday night! There were eight of us, my friend's daughter brought her new Build A Bear puppy, and the server brought a setting and high chair for the puppy! How cute is that?? we ordered a bunch of appetizers, the fried calamari was light and crisp, bbq shrimp's sauce was thick and sweet but yet savory, shrimp cocktail should be named prawn cocktail, and the squash ravioli - again, it's the sauce that did it, yum. Every time I see lobster bisque, I order it for the kids, they LOVE it - creamy, velvety with chunks of lobsters. Hubby had the ribeye steak, I had the filet mignon, took a bite of my friends' beef medallion and colorado rack of lamb. I think the ribeye steak and lamb came out the winner. Very juicy and tender, with a little bit burnt on the fat, perfection! We shared the banana cream pie, banana pudding, creme brulee for desserts. The pudding was no doubt the winner, the others are good, but if you can only order one, have the pudding. Again, expensive, but money well spent. Will come back again for sure!	2	0	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	txm5xr3_m-ohMye9YR7iRQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
sSWgjrwJs53AhATuMcn9FQ	5	2011-04-08 00:00:00	Favorite steakhouse in Las Vegas. Conveniently located in The Venetian and servers are very attentive. Classy, noise level wasn't too high, they even help the ladies with their chair when they sit. Big list of wine choices and they have huge cuts of rib-eye. Full bar you can order drinks from when you first enter the restaurant.\n\nMy first time I came with 2 other friends, I believe I ordered the bone-in Ribeye, which is unbelievably HUGE. It was literally bigger than my face. I got my ribeye in medium rare, and came out to be just right. Lots of butter, and we also ordered a couple sides. Picked out a bottle of wine which was the perfect topping to our fatty peices of steak.\n\nThey also serve dinner rolls! Warm and soft, and lots of butter =]\n\nI came back in recent March and ordered a smaller cut, also in medium rare but it wasn't as good as my first time here. Ate here with one other person, he ordered filet mignon which was very tender. We each ordered a glass of wine, although I'd rather choose a bottle instead next time as there are more choices of wine. Also had the lobster bisque, which I absolutely LOVE, so creamy but it was a little thin. Not too many pieces of lobster meat either. Ordered one side, a baked potato which was a little on the dry side.\n\nThere was a small fly that kept flying around us during dinner... It ended up in my water...\n\nHad creme brulee for dessert, they also serve homemade madeleine cookies with the creme brulee, both were very good.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A8OXd6dznFXC3QgB3L6FYA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
sTHM4r9njebk0JFyE04ymQ	2	2016-06-12 00:00:00	My companion thought his rib-eye was very good, but nothing to differentiate it from other quality steakhouses. I had the salmon dish that the waiter said was a signature dish on most of Emeri's restaurant menus. My salmon was topped with bbq sauce and had a sausage hash - the salmon was prepared well, but I didn't care for the taste of the dish. Instead of bread, they came by at the beginning of the meal with two oily popovers per person.  The room is unattractive.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	eDk38AVNzCvOxhwQEfrZ9Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
sU6fBJq3Km9QyrJ7AUtAZw	4	2009-07-07 00:00:00	I've been here for a total of 3 times.. I think.. This was my FIRST ever formal ass restaurant.. \n\nMy family and I got the special treatment, the taste test.. It was a 6 course meal and it was just too good. First they came out with the chips, something good to pick at until more food came out.. Soup, a refreshing trio platter that consist of fruit, crab meat, and a small salad. Then a piece of salmon topped with a thinly, crunchy slice of potato on top w/ veggies and a to die for sauce.. Then lamb with risotto. The risotto wasn't cooked to my liking but I was super full to even finish this..\n\nI was finally excited for the dessert platter. It was a FULL plate of all the desserts they offered.. Pecan pie, bread pudding, a chocolate cake, cheesecake, and banana cake. My personal fave was their bread pudding and pecan pie.. Mmmmm\n\nIf my brother wasn't one of the chefs here we wouldve paid ridiculous amounts of money.. I havent been here in a hot sec and I really want to go back..\n\nVery trendy and chic restaurant in the lovely Venetian hotel.. Service is  EXCEPTIONAL. If you have the money - its a MUST try and judge for yourself..	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	unubeQuu5QEBj6wLmUg9aw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
suEs9dhesiQEPbvx3_RB8Q	1	2012-09-17 00:00:00	WORST STEAKHOUSE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. \n\nSo I just stopped by to have lunch by myself. I read the reviews and cannot wait to have a perfectly cooked Filet Mignon. I got the BBQ shrimp and the Filet Mignon ordered specifically MEDIUM RARE. The BBQ shrimps are four tiny shrimps that are by no means jumbo shrimps but suspiciously resembled frozen out of a bag. \n\nAnd then is the Filet Mignon. They overcooked it so much that when I taste it, I almost wanted to cry. It can hardly pass for well done. I was so hungry and I waited 35 minutes for it. But I had to wash it down my throat with water. If this is MEDIUM RARE, then I will be ordering a live cow next time. The manager Michael did come by, confirmed that the steak is overcooked and asked if they can take it back. (I cannot wait for another 30 minutes for a new one. Doesn't a customer's time mean anything to you?) This is nice. But when the chef finished cooking my steak, how can he decide this is OK to serve? He must have cared so little about how his customer would think to decide to serve me this. LET ME TELL YOU. IT IS NO DIFFERENT THAN SPITTING IN MY FACE.\n\nPaid 95 dollars for the bill. I am feeling like a complete loser right now. Good thing is at least I came alone. If I have brought my GF, she would think I want a break up. And Michael, next time this happens, just take 20 dollars off the bill. You guys can never be a top notch restaurant.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4L8hP2C31jR940496ws6WA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
svbEFajZRbdMyKXWHDk8Bg	5	2014-03-30 00:00:00	Our last night in Vegas & my daughter & I went to Delmonico for dinner.  The service was tops, our waiter Frank was the best!  We had the barbecue shrimp appetizer-excellent!  So tasty and the sauce--so good!  My daughter ordered the NY sirloin and I ordered the lobster bisque.  The steak was superb; like cutting butter and seasoned perfectly.  Unfortunately, I became suddenly ill totally unrelated to the food and had to leave for a bit.  When I returned Frank, our waiter seemed quite concerned and brought me a club soda.  Sadly I wasn't able to eat my meal or have the banana cream pie I had dreamed about sharing with my daughter.  I was not charged for my bisque or the club soda; which I really expected to pay for.  The care and courtesy extended to me was so appreciated!

sxBoNAxyjriKCOauc7Rf4g	5	2016-01-12 00:00:00	Excellent experience overall and best steakhouse in Vegas. I'd say it is the best restaurant I've ever been to and we have been to many fine dining restaurants. This was the second time we've dined here and both times rate the highest score I can give. Our server, Frank, and his crew were fantastic! The apps were great, bbq shrimp and bone in bacon. Salads were just alright but main courses and dessert was great. Filet and bone in ribeye were what most of our 7 top ordered, all cooked and Creole seasoned to perfection. Sides are shareable and the cream corn was the best. If you get dessert, you must go with the banana cream pie! We'll definitely be attending again.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Z_T4HH4LZEQZjMwP1ak_eg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

My wife's filet was tasty and what one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. Unfortunately, my ribeye was tough and full of fat. I would say about half of it was edible. With al of the choices to enjoy a quality steak in Vegas, ignore the hype and go somewhere else.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	0YddhXMfi_IG4wKl1daa_g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Two servers wait on you and actually share the foodie secrets you want to know.  Allergic to seafood and think steak is a food group for a husband or a meat lover, no problem, let the chefs here make you a special dish or sauce not on the menu that you will never forget.  The sturgeon was a designer version of catfish, and was very impressive.  By end of the 4th course, with a bonus freebie in the middle compliments of the chef, you have the Olympic urge to go for dessert.  Go for the gold.  Not to sweet, not too rich, just amazing - like everything in New Orleans, just like Emeril.   Chocolate treats here won't disappoint.  By 8pm, the place is packed, and the magic is nearly gone, so come early, esp. with a date, you won't be disappointed.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	OUwhOAYj-nKxwvNQX22skA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

SZWITs-n85j5D3p7J8zugw	5	2015-11-26 00:00:00	Finally, after many visits to Las Vegas, I made it to Delmonico Steakhouse at the Venetian, and I loved my dinner! Ordered both the foie gras and the truffle Parmesan potato chips to start. They were both brought to the table at the same time so I knew I would need to eat the foie gras first which was quite good. The potato chips were great, and since I had ordered the wagyu ribeye for $90, I didn't want to fill up on the chips, I asked if they could box up the chips to take back to my room.  No problem, and they were delicious the next day! The wagyu ribeye is the best beef I've ever had! Perfect med-rare with great flavor and the most tender beef ever! I've had wagyu at other steakhouses in LV, but this blew away the competition!  The size was perfect for me: 6 or 8 ounces (I forgot which). Since this is white truffle season, I chose the white truffle ice cream that is vanilla ice cream stuffed with lots of small pieces of truffle. It is served as 3 balls which I figured I'd eat one or two, but it was so addictive that I ate the whole thing! Service was very friendly and attentive. Delmonico Steakhouse is now my favorite steakhouse!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	y6UplUH72gl3eBtG6ACa1w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I could have used more lentils but heh it's cool. \n-Bone in ribeye was, as everyone else says, amazing.  \n-Pineapple mojitos, really refreshing but also very strong.  \n\nSadly, no room for dessert.

T2fPYht6Se-TChBhPDVoTQ	1	2013-03-21 00:00:00	We have previously eaten here each time we're in Vegas because the food is excellent.  We've eaten here our last three anniversaries - this year was our 25th.  We were seated and the evening began well enough; however, there was a large group of men at a table several feet away becoming louder and louder as the evening wore on. As other couples in the room finished no one was reseated in our area (the stone walled room with the wine 'wall').  As the group became louder their language also worsened to the point of being profane and the mention of male body parts. My wife and I were appalled as well as shocked that the staff  which recognized the situation did NOTHING but apologize to us. There was no request that the group exercise some decorum or that we be moved.  \n\nOne of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas failed to deliver on a very special occasion.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Dp5OlBr36QA-0e8ZNtczpw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Service was exceptional but food was so disappointing.\nI LOVED Emeril's restaurant in New Orleans (NOLA) and I was sooo excited but this was a let down.  \nI had the ceasar and it was fine but nothing compared to the one at NOLA (which was the best one of my life).  The ricotta grilled cheese was bland (but good in that comfort food kind of way).  The tomato soup it came with was good--nothing special.\nThe dessert (apple fritters) were amazing--mini-apple crispy pies with good ice cream.  I would go back for only that.  Otherwise, nothing special and a personal let down.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	mSmR8zS7lmUy6gtEAXMKiQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

t5k7b3uoNR7csY509C3qYA	3	2010-03-31 00:00:00	Five star food. The service? Not so much. \n\nWhile in Vegas, my boyfriend and I decided it was time to splurge a bit and eat some tasty, tasty cow. We were seeing Blue Man Group that night, and this place was located right next to the theatre. And it's an Emeril restaurant. Awesome, right?\n\nWe were seated promptly for our 830 reservation. I sat down and the guy put my napkin on my lap and stepped on my foot in the process. No big deal; I'm a klutz too. Shortly thereafter, a waiter appeared, informed us that we'd have three servers that night. He then asked us if we'd like bottled or tap water, and then asked if we wanted a wine list. We answered and he went off to take care of it. Not 30 seconds later someone else (one of our other servers, I assume) showed up and gave us the exact same spiel. We answered the same way. \n\nSoon after, the first guy appeared with the wine list, which was literally 25 pages long. Ok, I both love me some wine and understand that this is a nice place, but a wine list that long is overwhelming. Yes, they had a page with Kevin's (the sommelier, I assume) picks, but still. \n\n20 minutes after we received the wine list, our server finally showed up to take our wine and food orders. We decided to split a ribeye and some potato gratin. I also got the gumbo, which was served promptly along with our wine. \n\nAs I said before, everything was delicious. The wine was great, the gumbo was extremely flavorful, the ribeye was tender and wonderful, and I also loved the potato gratin. However, when we got our food, I asked the server if he could give us the check a little early so we wouldn't have to rush to make our show (we were cutting it close, especially with the time it took for the server to come take our order). He insisted we'd have plenty of time and refused to give us the check. This is because he wanted to offer us dessert after our meal. Fine. Whatever. Still annoying. \n\nI'm hoping that this was just an off night, because it seems that most of the reviews here are very complimentary of the service. I'd be willing to give this place another shot, because the food was really that good (and actually kind of reasonably priced for what you get if you split a steak like we did). \n\nSo, we'll see...	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Wo_ASbM3pzJ4r1Qf6CcNOA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

t9DX4GwoLjRPQlTjXJ1ziA	4	2014-09-22 00:00:00	We have been twice now, and really enjoy Delmonico. It's the little things in service - for example, my friend was wearing a black skirt, and they took away her napkin. She was confused and asked for a napkin and they said oh, we're grabbing you a black one. Just so that she didn't get white threads on her skirt... \n\nThe lobster bisque is AMAZING - best I've had, anywhere EVER. The bread is also crazy delicious! It's these weird puffy rolls that are so flaky and good. \n\nI had filet which is normally excellent. I did have one time where for some reason mine was medium and my friend's was medium rare, though we had ordered opposite. We didn't care much though and just switched our steaks :-)  I think they confused the orders in the kitchen. \n\nThe service is great - we had Michael Jackson (for real, that was his name) last night and he was super helpful and friendly. \n\nOh yeah and the bread pudding. OMG... \n\nFor the lobster bisque, the bread and bread pudding (plus service) I would give it five starts. The four is because though the steaks are good, I have admittedly had many that are much better. I would still absolutely go back (and really enjoy it) I just can't say it's a "to die for" steak.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	v2HxTx0A8MkJ1oM1yJ4www	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We were underdressed/too casual (shorts/tank tops) to sit in the formal dining area so we just shared a steak at the bar. We started off with drinks which were good and strong. I ordered the Lychee martini which was really good, and I couldnt even taste all the alcohol I watched him pour into. We shared a bone in ribeye, medium rare plus. The steak was really juicy and cooked perfectly, but it lacked flavor... We had to ask for salt and pepper. :(  I don't know if I'd go out of my way to come back...

It's amazing.  \n\nThe boyfriend and I were in Vegas for our anniversary and he made reservations at Delmonico.  I was excited :) \n\nWhen we were being lead to our seats, we oohed and awwed about how beautiful the restaurant was.  The ceilings and structure reminded us of the Conciergerie in France.  Very pretty.  \n\nAnyway, we were seated and given a very extensive wine list--some wines upward of $3000.  We opted for a glass of wine.  We opened the menu and no more than 5 minutes later, we knew exactly what we were going to order--scallops and gnocchi in basil butter sauce, lobster bisque, and two bone in ny strips cooked medium rare.  No sides--we wanted the beef.  \n\nAbout 10 minutes after we ordered, the waiter brought out a complimentary amuse-bouche.  Two puff pastries with bleu cheese mousse and walnuts.  They wanted to wish us a happy anniversary! How wonderful is that?  My bf was very surprised--when he had booked the reservation they asked him if it was for a special occassion.  He was very surprised they did something about it.  Well, it was delicious.  Now we were even more enthusiastic about the food.\n\nThe lobster bisque came next, and it was fantastic.  Creamy and perfectly seasoned.  The scallops (2 huge scallops to be exact) came next and were wonderful.  Perfectly seared on the outside and tender on the inside.  \n\nAnd the steak...oh boy.  It's huge!  It came out seared on the outside with a dollop of herbed butter.  I couldn't wait to get at it. It was perfectly red on the inside.  This was hands down the best steak I've ever had in my life.  It was seared so perfectly, that the fat around the edges of the steak were crispy (yes, I actually a good helping of the fat. It's better than butter!)  The food was amazing and we ate as much as we could--leaving behind almost nothing at all.  \n\nStill, we wanted dessert.  Pecan pie a la mode with caramel sauce. Fanfreakingtastic!!!  Delicious! The waiter told us it was the best pecan pie he had had in his life, and I concur.  Yummy! \n\nI only have high praises for this place.  Aside from the food, the staff was attentive and gracious.  We can't wait to go back--even if the $200 bill hurt a bit.	2	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	lLi9S_R99sfrLNy2H7idBg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

If you love a good steak (I've heard the other food is very good too) then this is THE place in Vegas. The atmosphere is classy but relaxed. You can feel comfortable in jeans. It's pricey - it's Vegas. The service is very good to excellent. I wouldn't recommend this place for small children. And who cares about parking?

tDiyguXbU0z4sDDyTGXiJg	5	2016-05-25 00:00:00	I'm almost always skeptical of anything with a celebrity chef's name because they're almost always underwhelming. Those types of establishments require that celebrity chef to attach their name to drive new customers. In this business (which I'm far from expert, but know what I like), it's word of mouth that should ultimately drive good cuisine.\n\nMy father told me to come here while I was in town and I'm so glad that I did. Vegas is full of traps and this one was not a trap at all, and if it was a trap I wandered in willingly.\n\nThe "Book of Whisky" is MASSIVE. Largest whisky/single malt/irish/worldwide whiskey list I've ever seen. I partook in a nice Yamazaki 12 (world renowned shit) and felt adventurous and tried an Amrut from India which was delectable and spicy as well. \n\nThe STEAK. I put it up there with Toro Toro as #1/#2 of all time. Flavorful, crunchy char, a nice butter sauce that only Emeril himself can probably cook up, and the service to match.\n\nI sat at the bar and my server was knowledgeable, attentive, and would come around the bar to take care of me which was unnecessary, but appreciated. Great ambience as well, very low key for Vegas, and elegant.\n\nMy new MUST DINE spot in Vegas. Will be back forever.	3	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	qY7MNRS_TPbZrDbDnWN_tg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The steaks are better here than anywhere on my home state Oklahoma and that's saying a lot. \n\nYou can walk in wearing jeans or a suit and the waitstaff and manager will always treat you the same. I know because I have literally dressed high and low for this restaurant. \n\nThe bartender is fast and knowledgable as are the servers. \n\nIn the 6 years I have dined here I have never had a bad meal or a bad experience.\n\nThanks for everything Delmonico. 6 stars.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	egtD3QDv__ldvbYgZf-kMg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

This ranks as the 3rd best Rib Eye flavor wise I've had behind Fleming's and Joe's Stone Crab IMO.  I had the mushrooms for sides which were good but not fantastic!  The Banana Cream Pie was exceptional.  Very thick and rich!  When you visit, dress like a High Roller!  =)	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	VmF-fUv-f7qZsGGUt4J4gA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

When my bf and I were first seated, we were asked if we were celebrating anything. We told them our anniversary and was served a complimentary amuse-bouche and sorbet dessert at the end.\n\nYay:\n-Truffle Parmesan potato chips: freshly made and amazing in flavor. You can taste all the elements of this working well together. I thought the truffle oil was going to overwhelm the dish but it was nicely perfumed throughout and complimented the freshly grated Parmesan. The chips were thin, crispy and airy. I almost ate the whole thing before my meal but had to stop myself. \n\nOther:\n-Ribeye steak special: the special of the day was a petite rib eye with foie gras. The steak otherwise would have been bland had it not been for the foie gras. It was perfectly cooked to my medium rare preference. \n-Ribeye: my bf got the regular ribeye without the special and it come out to be almost the same size as my petite filet. It was slightly seasoned more than mine. However when we reheated the leftover steaks, mine held up better and the foie gras melted into the meat flavoring it better than this one. \n-Mashed potatoes: just regular, nothing fancy.	2	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	BNIaIprs77ORSW7sy5cLDQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

THfIEOuRA4c0FHADLa3_ZA	5	2016-01-05 00:00:00	What an amazing place to eat. I had the New York strip with rosemary & garlic cloves. Medium rare was cooked to perfection as well. Absolutely delicious. I had two dirty martinis, which were mixed to perfection. Also they included 3 olives (odd numbers only acceptable in mixed drinks) without me having to ask for an odd number. I don't get picky when bar tenders don't know this about mixed drinks, but I sure do appreciate it when bar tenders do! \nTheir bread is light and lovely as well, which should be noted because you won't get full when treating yourself to some pre-entree goodness. \nI ordered their twice baked potato which was creamy and delicious beyond belief. I also tried their creamy spinach which was a lovely touch to my meal. \nFor dessert, I asked the server to suggest a dessert liquor and she brought me Licor 43. Highly recommend this booze too, but I appreciate the server knowing what to suggest. I also ordered their coconut ice cream for dessert, which was obviously as delicious as the rest of my meal. The best part is, the ice cream wasn't sugary. It just tasted like the flavor I ordered, without it feeling like there was sugar paste residue after eating it. An amazing place, with amazing servers and better food. Cheers!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	H-SmtwnrJTRek_DyfM0ZSA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

It was so good we ordered a second plate eventhough I had a side of foie gras with my filet mignon coming. I ordered my filet mignon medium rare and asked that it not be too salty...but it still came salty :( I only ate about half of it. But the simple seared foie gras was delicious.

It looked more medium and before he said anything, our waiter came by and noticed. Then he asked to take it back for a new one. The new ribeye came out in less than 2mins. Salads are excellent as well as the cocktails. Second time I've I've eaten there.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	BceIIAGwn5Obr9ZTY8OaLw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
TlFX4xEFhf6P4nBcEJcHkw	4	2017-02-01 00:00:00	What took me so long to dine at this place! \n\nDelmonico definitely is my one of my fav steakhouse in Vegas.  Original plan was going to Harvest in Bellagio however there was an incident on the strip, so here we were, detoured to Caesar Palace.  We were seated quickly on a Friday late night, woohoo, it's gonna be a good night.\n\nI like their menu, it was short and sweet only 2 pages, took us only 2 mins to pick our food.\n\nWe had applewood bacon, barbecue shrimp, lobster bisque, gumbo, bone in filet which was the house special of the day and also rack of lambs with chimichurri sauce.  \n\nThe applewood bacon was indeed a thick cut of pork belly, which was quick greasy, the flavor is good but it was so oily I couldn't have more than one bite, I didn't care much about it.  \n\nThe star of the night was the barbecue shrimp, highly recommend by the waiter, glad we took his advice, it was so delish! It was not the usual bbq sauce that u had before, this New Orleans style bbq sauce had a little tarted, smoky, spice, touch of sweet. Oh man... I literally licked the plate! Oops ... Not very lady like! \n\nLobster bisque was another surprise, it was rich and velvety with punch of flavors, came with chunks of lobster meats... It was perfect.\n\nComparing to the lobster bisque, gumbo was just ok, I was a little disappointed Coz gumbo was such a authentic plate represent Cajun creole cuisine. Besides the saltiness, there's not much flavor on the plate.\n\nOh yes...	6	3	5	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	bVTu2_lx2j8G8SJZDMDO8g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We had the table side Caesar Salad which was delicious of course and I had the filet mignon and boyfriend had a big bone in rib eye. We had scalloped potatoes as our side and everything was truly amazing. Our server said Jay-Z and Beyonce were there about one month prior which made us feel like our choice of eating here was a good one. We went to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and I let them know that when I made reservations. They did a great job of making sure everyone that encountered our table knew that which was nice- made us feel really valued. A really beautiful steak dinner and they did an excellent job of making our special occasion extra special. SO GOOD!!! Steak was cooked to perfection and the cajun rub that they put on it was really a nice touch. Can't hate anything with a large pat of butter on top either- of course it was everything I had hoped this filet would be and more. The crispy outside of the cajun spices was really a nice addition of course an emril style thing you'd hope for. YUM!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	6wMrH46ZTu_YLWJHrUDLsQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The side dishes are in very large portions.  I love the mushroom with my steak.  What makes Delmonico great isn't just the food.  The service is second to none.  We really do appreciate the great service at Delmonico.  We also appreciate the fact that every entree is delivered at the same time to every person.  We usually have 2 waiters and 2 bus boys serving us.  We go to Vegas sometimes just to go to Delmonico.  We typically pay about $160 for 2 people including tip.

And I think the price is very reasonable. \n\nIf I have to complain about anything is that I didn't like the Caesar salad cuz it was drenched in dressing. But everything else was super yummy. \n\nHere is what we ordered:\nTuna and salmon tartar: omg so good. Combined with the crispy chips, I could order two of it for an entry next time. \n\nFresh oysters: tasted very fresh\n\nBBQ Shrimp: got it despite yelp reviews say not to. Thought it was pretty good. Nice bbq sauce. \n\nLobster bisque: good but too salty. Tasted better with bread. There were big chunks of lobsters though. \n\nCaesar salad: it was made table side. Nothing spectacular, and way too much dressing. \n\nBone in rib eye: Amazing\n\nNew York Strip: pretty good but wasn't as good as the rib eye. \n\nSalmon: forgot the exact name but it was very good. It had like gumbo style things on the bottom which made it interesting. \n\nGarlic mushroom side: good \n\nGarlic mash potatoes: just goes so well with the rib eye.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	eql0l0b5VKBHVZzJJFwNcQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I love going to steak houses at lunch - - you usually get a great meal at a reasonable price.\n\nI had the deconstructed steak salad -- delicious.  Medium rare with blue cheese.  Yum.  Hub's had the Lobster Sliders -- divine. We each had a glass of wine, so it was an $80 lunch, with tip.\n\nService was spotty.  The assistant waiter was great, but our lead waiter was very distracted and barely attended the table.  When asked about simple wine questions (what blend was the Emeril Red), had to defer to the FoH manager.\n\nWill go back -- love Delmonico's here & in NOLA.

TRSsv7cJocDdxigzzD-1dg	5	2008-05-28 00:00:00	I seem to have really good luck with Emeril's restaurants. After my recent visit to Delmonico's, I'm beginning to think he can't go wrong. From the moment we walked in the door, it was just instantly different from all the other restaurants we visited. We were greeted warmly, seated immediately even though we were early, and had friendly, attentive service the entire time. \n\nThe atmosphere inside Delmonico's is not at all what I would have expected, but it is simple and lovely. The colors are warm, the lighting is excellent (especially at a steakhouse, I need to be able to see my food!), and the decor is plain and easy on the eyes (not a lot of decoration at all).\n\nWe started with some truffle potato chips and a tomato salad to share while we were getting settled. Vince curled up with the wine list with a big, giant grin on his face. Ah, so many choices to go with steak, but we can't really go wrong with Chambolle Musigny, so there you go, and we threw in a bottle of Sancerre to start. \n\nI ended up getting Emeril's famous bone-in ribeye, Vince got the filet, and Phil and Alexandra got BBQ shrimp and mushroom medallions. We also got an assortment of sides, including spinach, asparagus, mushrooms, and garlic smashed potatoes. For someone who likes pure, unadulterated meat, my ribeye was about as perfect as you can get. Cooked to my desired rare plus bloodiness, with a simple crust of Emeril's Essence, a beautiful quality cut without any tendons or gristle, just beautiful meatiness. Vince's filet was similarly perfect, nice and thick and bloody, with a delicious cajun rub that enhanced the meat without overpowering it. I was impressed with Alexandra's medallions - they were pretty large for medallions; they looked like big 4 oz filets in their own right. I'd had the shrimp before at Emeril's seafood restaurant so that was nothing new but those were also good. The spinach actually tasted like spinach (rather than cream), and the asparagus was nice and al dente. \n\nI finished up with some pecan pie, a generous Jamaica Blue Mountain espresso (I was impressed that the coffee list provided a wide variety of espressos from which to choose), and a cognac. Too bad it was only lunch! This meal was certainly the highlight of our trip (In addition to being the best, it was also the least expensive). Afterwards our server took us on a tour of the restaurant. Next time we are definitely going to try to reserve the chef's table. I already can't wait!	10	4	11	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Dd-TkEszFMkSF-vRih51fQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The sauteed mushrooms were good, but I've had better.\n\nAmbiance and service were good, I must say.  The waiters were attentive and came by when needed.

Given we had a lot of extra food, it was still a good dinner...  He loved the sides we had, and his cut of meat was perfect, as was mine as well...  Wish we could afford coming here ALL THE TIME, but I guess we'll have to see where our jobs will lead us...  Otherwise we may actually have to PAY to come to Vegas...

tUMhtFFSZyOazeC5Mwro5g	4	2014-10-26 00:00:00	After a quick drink at Public House, I was feeling pretty good, and hungry, and a little buzzed. Here's how my conversation with our waiter began:\n\nMe: "What kind of bread is this?"\nWaiter: "They're popovers sir."\nMe: "Has anyone ever commented that they're shaped like dicks?" \nWaiter: "Haha, no sir, very good observation sir." \n\nYup, their popovers were pretty much shaped like dicks. They were a bit cold, oily, and combined with the refrigerated butter (one of my pet peeves at restaurants), a big disappointment. Despite the phallic start to dinner, the rest of the meal and service was excellent. \n\nThe recommended lobster bisque was a great way to cleanse my palate of that bread. There were big chunks of lobster meat and the bisque was well-seasoned without going overboard with the salt. Delmonico is known for their bone-in ribeye so I ordered that medium-rare. The steak was more on the medium side, but no complaints here as it was just as juicy and tender. No steak is complete without a side of creamed spinach, which was done well. All sides are portioned to be shared. Despite a misstep with my friend's order (bone-in NY strip instead of boneless), service was spot on.	4	13	5	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Well, neither the meal not the service were particularly great.\n\nFirst, even though we had a reservation, they had us wait for 20 min in the lounge. Fine, we had some drinks. My cosmopolitan was not impressive at all: I had two sips and didn't finish the rest. \n\nThen the food itself. Good news is, everything came very fast. Bad news is, it tasted OK but not great: steak was either too chewy or had too much spice (and we had the famed bone-in ribeye and a chateaubriand (spelling?)), truffled chips were fried very brown.\n\nTableware was uninspired, especially the tea cups got to me: I think I've seen better ones at a Motel 6 for breakfast.\n\nLast, the service. Overall it was OK, but then, when I was in the middle of a story, the waiter comes to ask how we are doing and goes on for 10 minutes about this and that and how the convention is different this year, etc. Really? By the time he is done, nobody remembers what we were talking about, and I am MAD.\n\nFind a better place to spend your money.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	TZiE5oDHGbXrMrvPBaidPA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

On some nights I've received some of the finest steak I've ever had with some decent service to go along with it. Often times, I feel like I deal with waitresses / hostesses who seem to act as if their menu is one of the greatest things about Vegas, which they are sadly mistaken. I've noticed their wine list is impeccable and their decor is really what makes this place scream "fine dining." But sadly because of subpar service and outrageous prices ($51 for filet mignon, 8 oz), its simply fine dining that isn't so fine.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ysCBsXWPB-LAiewVS3jZfQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Although Las Vegas traffic sucked and it took 40 min to get there from Cosmopolitan. \n\nWe had the best crew serving us tonight, be sure to ask for Braden, Selina, and JoJo. Amazing folks and with a great sense of humor and honest recommendations. \n\nGET the chateaubriand and if you like spices, add the au poivre. Worth every penny and then some. Skip an appetizer unless you have multiple people in your party, the steak will fill you up and then some! We didn't have room for dessert but was treated to an ice cream waffle cone with a delicious flavor to celebrate the man's birthday. \n\nOh yeah, don't be shocked by the 100 page wine list or the bottles ranging up to $37,000. You can find some reasonably priced options! We will be back!	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	PiWlV_UC_-SXqyxQM9fAtw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The food was exceptional we had the following items: BBQ Shrimp appetizer, Caesar Salad - prepared at your table, Seared Tenderloin & Sea Scallops with Bacon Potato, Toasted Walnuts and Blue Cheese and aged Beef Tenderloin. I like the ambiance of the place, classy but not stuffy.	5	0	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	njgBnm5Czhsgj9xOi-C0Sg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Food was really good, not too heavy but definitely filling. The pot roast fell apart without needing a knife. The Banana Cream Pie was delightfully in the place between rich and too rich. Definitely freshly made.\n\nI would most definitely like to come again at dinnertime.	1	1	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	WcUgAsVEW-6Rlkikm-xIKA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Servers here make you feel like they genuinely care about if you're enjoying your meal. \n\nAmbiance is very classy and  slightly dim which is perfect.  Dress to impress!\n\nAppetizer \nBBQ Shrimp - these were super tasty with Cajun spices and the shrimp sit it a nice broth. Shrimps were cooked perfectly.\n\nMeals:\nFilet Mignon-cooked and seasoned perfectly juicy and full of flavor.  Good crust on the outside. \n\nRack of Lamb- very disappointing,  I've ordered lamb at other top restaurants with no problems but this one has way too much fat the first 3 pieces I cut were 85% fat.  I was a little bummed and I hardly ever mention dissatisfaction or send a plate back but my gf urged me since we are paying top $$ for our meals.  \nWithout hesitation after mentioning how the lamb was not up to par the manager. immediately came out inspected the lamb and agreed it was more fatty then usual and allowed me to swap out my lamb with a bone in NY Strip. \nThe strip was cooked beautifully! Good crust on the outside and perfect medium rare on inside not to mention flavor was om point.\n\nSides: (here's where I knock down a star)\nCreamed spinach- was good but not great it lacked a little bit of flavor and a bit bland. \n\nAu Gratin- see above with creamed spinach.  It lacked that wow factor and was a little runny. \n\nDespite the sub par sides the filet and NY strip were both excellent and the impeccable service makes me give 4 stars. \n\nCheers \n\nPS cocktails were good a little on the strong side which I like but not too strong to make you cringe,  good flavor.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	gcz5baFhV096VSrB9EESXw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
u1KSGl3CR-y_NpCrp4jQFg	5	2015-09-11 00:00:00	One of the best steaks of my life! We were there May of 2014. We had to modify our reservation as we were running late and they were able to accommodate us around 830pm. They served this little puff bread with butter and it literally melted in my mouth. I have been dreaming of those since then! I chose the ribeye and my boyfriend chose the new york steak. Both steaks were seared to perfection! I chose mashed potatoes which was delicious but my boyfriend got the fingerling potatoes which were to DIE FOR. the herbs it simmered in was mouth watering! We were even impressed when they delivered a complimentary melon sorbet with happy anniversary written in chocolate. It was a delicious delight and we cant wait to go back again!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	qWIw1rgVd06B1OOw_MQ7xA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
u3p4bjkX9TUor40OWjQafQ	2	2012-06-05 00:00:00	My brother in law's birthday required steak...so naturally Delmonico Steakhouse sounded like a great option. \n\nHere's the thing, I love steak, but i'm trying to cut back on being a crazed carnivore. I ordered the half roasted duck (yeah i know it's still meat but it's not red meat...get off my back) and my wife had the halibut. What kind of morons go to a well reviewed steakhouse and don't order steak? Well it's nice to meet you.\n\nMy duck was ehh... her fish was ehhh\n\nHad a taste of the ribeye (seriously, shut up...How could I realistically NOT try it?) and wow...REALLY good.\n\nBut my rating is only 2 stars you say? Yeah, well my experience was kinda lame...the attentive staff was fine, the prices were completely outrageous even for the strip, and our food was just kinda boring. I didn't think much of it to be honest.\n\nYou may be saying... "Well moron, you ordered duck and fish at a steakhouse, what did you expect?" I would then reply "Hey, if it's on the menu, it should be held to the same standards as anything else!". So There! :P\n\nIf I do want to pay too much for a really good steak, I know where to go...but y'know, I'm a local and that is rare. (get the pun...nudge nudge...get it?)\n\nWhat I will say is that it's a classy establishment and they appear to cook a fine slab-o-meat. But i'd steer (I keep doing it!) clear of any non-cow based items. Sorry for the puns!\n\nI'm not really sorry.	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	7rngkJ2lES5OthbMb4qe1Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
u5lfFUY4FEHpmzc8K2CWjw	4	2009-11-03 00:00:00	We went here while in town for the Halloween weekend. Never even heard of the place, but figured why not give it a shot.\n\nThe decor is upscale, but pretty boring actually. No flare at all to it. \n\nHere is what i either ordered or tried:\n\nLobster bisque - Very good. Creamy and rich, yet the lobster came through right away.\n\nSteak Tartare - Good.Had a bit too much mustard sauce for me, as that was about all i could taste. But the meat had alot of flavor.\n\nLamb chops - Very well done. The lamb was cooked well(medium rare) and was nice and juicy. \n\nI ordered the ribeye(rare). I thought it was on the verge of medium rare, but totally acceptable. Nice flavor, and good portion. Not the best steak i have had, especially since the waiter said it was both wet and dry aged. \n\nSauteed spinach - Very good, but i would have preferred a bit more creaminess to it. Although i am not sure if it was supposed to be cream spinach or not, it seems almost like it was halfway between steamed and creamed. either way it was a very good side dish.\n\nFilet - Very well cooked and tender. I found the truffle crust lacking in flavor though, as i could not really taste it at all.\n\nAnd i want to say halibut, but i could be off. Either way, the special fish entree was probably the best of the night. Cooked just right, and the sauce was excellent.\n\nOverall i liked the dinner alot. For the price though it was nothing all that special.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	N-7QEPbwFLnh0vOnJlwIyQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
U7U8VTShZ4pdPbdtjuhVcg	3	2014-12-02 00:00:00	I want to give this place 2 stars, but because of the excellent service I'll bump it up to 3. The best thing about this place was the impeccable service received.  I dined here with my husband on a late Friday night.  The food here was just "OK". My breakdown of each dish is this:\n\nThe Popovers: meh..they were ok. I think they were over cooked which made them a bit too dry and with a slightly burnt butter taste. I like Tyler Florence does a better version at Wayfare Tavern (SF).\n\nAppetizer special - Pappardelle w/ Crimini Mushrooms in a white wine sauce finished with parmigiana: Good stuff. Very light and tasty pasta, too many mushrooms for my liking, I would've preferred more pasta. Very small tasting plate so don't expect to get more than 3 or 4 bites.\n\nCreamed spinach: Another meh dish. I wanted more flavor here. Maybe a finish with butter would've helped. Some seasoning or something. Literally all I could taste was watery spinach.\n\nTwice Baled loaded Potatoes: YESSSSSS PLEASE! Now this was a great dish. Flavor in every bite. Perfect partner for my steak.\n\nRibeye Steak (w/o bone) OSCAR STYLE w/ Jumbo Lump Crab Meat, Grilled Asparagus and Béarnaise.- I SOOOOOO wanted to love this steak. I really did. Order a my steak cooked medium and unfortunately it came out damn near rare. Like literally just short of bleeding. There was hardly any flavor.  The best part was the burnt edges as they actually added some flavor. I'd give my steak a 2/5, however, the Jumbo Lump crab and Béarnaise WAS THE BOMB!\n\nSmoked Pork chop: my husband truly enjoyed his pork chop. Tender with a smokey flavor all the way thru. The pork chop was huge! I'm not a big pork chop eater, but it was tasty. \n\nPecan pie: Now this was worth the price of admission. A tasty warm & nutty pie with cold delicious ice cream. Mmmmm mmmmm good. I'd come here again just to eat this. A MUST have if you're ordering desserts.\n\nAs previously mentioned in other reviews, the wine here is definitely over priced. I understand the mark ups restaurants need to make, but I think Delmonico's takes the "upcharge" to an entirely new level. We ordered a bottle of Kim Crawford's Sauvignon Blanc, which retails for about $18-20, we were charged $45 for the bottle!!! Talk about a rip off! Outside of opening the bottle and pouring the wine, what constitutes a $25 mark up?\n\nNeedless to say I most likely won't return here. I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think it was worth the price tag. I'd prefer to go back to Mario Batali's B&B, which is located directly across the walk way from Delmonico's.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	FQTfUYsCnBryER6L8NFyYA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Michael took care of us and was fabulous throughout the evening. We brought our own bottle of Grgich and happily paid the $35 corking fee - bargain. Had tuna tartar, BBQ shrimp, bone in ribeye, lamb chops, creamed corn, truffled chips & bread pudding - all amazing. No complaints whatsoever....deliriously happy. Total bill $235 not including tip - reasonable for locale & quality. Definitely would recommend.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	1Q3UtWrnRxriO0PbgUbqNw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
U8I_yBhRUQ3u02lMVPAKpA	5	2009-01-18 00:00:00	The original New Orleans Delmonicos gave me some of earliest foodie education.  WAY back before it was bought by Emeril, it was a Garden District favorite.  Many of the old, wealthy families of New Orleans dined there.  It was not on the tourist trail.\n\nI was distraught when Emeril bought Delmonicos.  I thought he was cheesy and obnoxious, and I just knew he was going to ruin this Southern matriarch.  I could not bring myself to go there and view the damage.\n\nThen I found out a Delmonicos had opened in Vegas.  Who cared if it is cheesy I thought...we're in Vegas, home of cheesiness!  So, Sugar Bear and I checked it out in 2001.  \n\nWe were delighted to see that there was a strict dress code.  Our meal was splendifferous.  The presentation--stunning.  The restaurant--breathtaking.  I could not believe it!  Delmonicos had not been ruined by Emeril after all.  He had taken my favorite old school restaurant from New Orleans and made her into a youthful Southern Belle again.  We were dazzled.\n\nWe returned to Delmonicos a year later to celebrate our wedding.  Perfect.\n\nWe've been several times since, and have always loved our meals.  It has been disappointing that the dress code has become lax.  Last time we were there, we saw jeans and shorts.  Downgrade for a place that previously required a coat.  I guess dress codes don't really fly with the younger crowd, and this Southern lady has had to ride with the times.  \n\nIf you are in Vegas, or New Orleans, this is not a place to miss!	2	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	xF3Wzkv1icIzZu4IiYCwMg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

ubX6iG-vBMyYxexr4ZrE3g	3	2011-07-06 00:00:00	Almost done catching up with my reviews. Here is my last one for tonight. After going to Carnevino the night before, Delmonicos kind of took the back seat for me. However, we were with a big group and everyone else loved the food. Bone in rib eye, tenderloin medalions, sirloin, to lamb we had everything on the table. Absolutely no complaints about the food. \n\nHowever, we were seated kind of in the corner round table which was fine but some of us were facing a glass enclosed small room that had stacks of chairs. What is that room? Was it seriously storage space we were starring at? I didn't expect to see a stack of black chairs in a glass case room throughout my whole dinner from a high end restaurant. \n\nComing from a delicous dessert finish with Afrogato the night before, I asked the waitress if it could be made. She said sure it could. I was very excited only to realize when the bill came that she charged $8 for a shot of Espresso and $10 for scoop of ice cream.

We chose this place because they were one of the few restaurants that had their regular menu on NYE. The atmosphere is very classy and romantic with fairly dim lights. The service was good. Our waiter did his job quite well. \n\nThe food was very good. We got their Bone In Ribeye which was massive. Very juicy and tender and perfectly seasoned. My bf loved it. I got their BBQ Salmon and it was so good! I recommend this dish! Esp since its a dish you can't get anywhere else but here! Definitely get it if you like salmon! For sides we got their creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes. Both were good! I loved the garlic that accompanied the potatoes. Nom Nom. We ended the night with Banana Cream Pie which was so good!

UFBG39zEiwJqmos2p7f55Q	5	2014-01-06 00:00:00	Recently had lunch here with my small work crew (3 of us) to celebrate the Holidays. The restaurant was completely dead mid-week so at first I thought maybe we'd made a terrible mistake. My fears were quickly assuaged as our food started arriving. We ordered the lobster sliders as an appetizer to share between two of us, and our other colleague had the lobster bisque. The lobster sliders? Well they are the things dreams are made of, I'm still salivating over them weeks later. Lobster bisque was also apparently outstanding. Fries with old bay, perfectly cooked and tasty. For our entrees, two of us each had the grilled skirt steak sandwich and the other had the steak salad. The steak sandwich and truffle fries were absolutely delicious and I hear the salad was really fantastic. Service was impeccable and obviously we had the restaurant to ourselves, so our every need was catered to perfectly. I definitely will be back.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	H0tfWQsGjEBuhXD4WUtpHw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

One of my favorite restaurants overall.\n\nService is great.\n\nFood is amazing. Trumpets sounded when I took my first bite into the "Bone-In Ribeye." \n\nI would highly recommend that you discuss with your server the definition of medium rare and medium. I know one time a friend said it was undercooked for medium rare, but honestly it was fine. He had a different definition for medium rare based on past experiences with "other steakhouses" (but I am not sure I would refer to them as real steakhouses).	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	QdP5em3KEBlTzoytRYQVlA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I've been to a lot of high end steakhouses and this is one of the few places that really stood out and make me want to return.\n\nSecond visit:  Second time was a disappointment.  Steak was too buttery and oily.  Was not as memorable as the first time to make me want to come back again with so many other options in Vegas.  The ambiance is nice.

It just wasn't amazing.  I could have made everything we ordered at home.  It just wasn't special. \nThe service was really awkward.  We were seated at a table by the area they prep the plates before bringing them to the table. That was annoying.  Even more obnoxious was how the servers would lean against the wall 2 feet from our table and stare.\nLastly our desert menu was plopped down on the table and then the server walked away.  \nWomp Womp!!!!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4DrtQoV20cbDOlnOk_rxHw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I've been to his restaurants in Miami and New Orleans, and those were both 5-star experiences; however, the food at Delmonico was not as good as my previous experiences.  It was good, just not 5-star good.  I had the rib-eye, which was perfectly cooked.  But the grits left A LOT to be desired, which was disappointing considering that grits is a staple of southern cooking.  The service was good, although the main server seemed a bit distracted at times.  At that price point, my experience is that servers are almost falling all over you.  With all of the wonderful choices of restaurants in Vegas, I think I'll try somewhere different next time.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	an-ijVpGQxgiOBX9qTBOyQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

For our table side Caesar salad meant for two guests, they stretched it for the three of us. The times between our bbq shrimp appetizer, plump and flavorful, the salad, and our meats were appropriate. My rack of lamb (med-rare) was cooked to perfection, juicy and tasty. My parents' filet mignon (med) were just as tasty with a generous serving of butter on top. The dessert of carrot cake did not disappoint. The huge cake (definitely recommend sharing) was delicious.

We booked it and headed down from the room to get some steaks...\n\nHostess A+ sat us down and gave us menu and said server would be with us in a second:\n\nServer asked what drinks and then informed us that we needed to make a make a decision quickly as the kitchen was closing... Sooooo y have a 2pm option of ur kitchen is going to close 5 minutes into getting seated? Not a good way to start off the meal...\n\nNow onto food\n\nOrdered BBQ shrimp app.... Great option very good sauce and very unique maybe it had a lil but if Emerills BAM....\n\nGumbo bowl also amazing sauce was best gumbo so far ever\n\n\nCesar salad was ehh.... Wouldn't get it again\n\nI had bone in NY strip medium rare... Cooked and season to perfection and that dollop of sauce on top tasty\n\nTable had 2 Bone in rib eyes also very good and one had steak salad which is prob one of the better steak salads  to date\n\n\nMushrooms side dish best one of all steakhouses ever visited and I've been to a lot!\n\nOohhhh and those popovers for the table abloom very good especially with the BBQ sauce from the shrimp\n\n\nDesert was chocolate cake with pistachio ice cream very very good\n\nAlso the other desert was the butter cake which was also very good\n\n\nBest part of the meal was he Sommelier he was very interesting to talk to and very good service and wine recommendation.... If you go ask him for his advice def won't let you down...\n\n\nTill next time Vegas ohhhh and change this lame kitchen closes soon thing ...because I may have wanted a 2nd steak	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ipZQKv2MQVjl1z4gpUhyZA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
uNlcz_isVI0hRwPvWoUR9w	3	2008-03-25 00:00:00	My group and I were congregating outside in the bar area prior to our reservation and I was called by name to be seated which was very nice.  The dining room is actually more like one large hall way with two adjoining rooms.  You get about 2-3 waiters per table and they offer very good and attentive service overall.  So anyways on to the food review.  I ended up ordering the tuna/salmon tartare appetizer and the bone-in rib steak medium rare.  The Tuna and salmon both were very tasty but the portion was rather small.  For $18, I would expect a little bit more.  Now on to the reason why we dined here....my steak came out and it looked giant.  The overall taste of the meat was only decent at best.  I was really expecting a more flavorful piece of meat.  Maybe they forgot to season it or just didn't put enough of emeril's spice?  I could tell though the meat quality was very, very good.  They advertise wet-age steaks, but I much prefer dry-aged steaks.  Too bad my steak was only just okay and for $52 I didn't feel ripped off but more disappointed.  I thought about ordering the bone-in NY strip and regret it now.  I'd sacrifice little fat and marbling for some more flavor. The side dishes that our group shared were also just okay, nothing spectacular but not bad either.	4	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	MuhUC0v3qBBTj6D2DO0H_w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
UNVbhL2aCfoyOPttKlF2ng	4	2012-11-03 00:00:00	Solid.  Still serving up all the flavor, fat, and syrupy opulence one expects from the Emeril Lagasse empire.  Oh, it happens to serve some great steaks.\n\nLunch is straight forward.  Salads, gumbo, and an INCREDIBLE STEAK SANDWICH.  A juicy skirt steak is topped with loads of roasted mushrooms, onions, wilted spinach and a pungent horseradish mayo on a warm ciabatta roll with a side of crispy truffle fries.  A great deal for under $20.\n\nDinner brings out the best.  For starters its hard to pass on the truffle parm potato chips (you weren't expecting that huh).  Crispy, earthy, just good eats and so perfect with any cocktail or wine.  The roasted heirloom tomato soup with  grilled ricotta cheese sandwich, creamy and acidic, comforting goodness.\n\nThe steaks are all great quality USDA prime.  Well trimmed and dry aged on site.  Unfortunately, the selection of cuts is limited.   The bone in strip, dense beefy goodness and stands up well to the Creole seasoning (used on all their steaks).  Dry aged steak purist will balk at its use as it destroys the umame goodness.  The bone in rib is more tender and makes the perfect base for "Oscar" style prep (topped with a generous heaping of jumbo lump crab meat, asparagus, and a very rich and tangy béarnaise that blends perfectly with the creole seasoning). Win!\n\nIt's not all about the steaks.  The apple smoked kurobuta ham chop with grits and cider reduction is outstanding.  Pure simplicity.  Natural, tender ham packing  deep "hammy" flavor whose richness and saltiness is balanced perfectly by the acidity and sweetness of hard cider reduction.  Holiday ham on steroids!\n\nFriendly and efficient service.\n\nVery good wine list.  Vegas resort prices.\n\nBAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! (Four stars; yeah I couldn't resist).	19	13	18	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
uO1aD0auW148cXb_Ii9rHg	5	2011-06-02 00:00:00	Excellent, excellent service. That is the one thing I remember about this restaurant. Everyone who served my party of 4 was so professional from start to finish. The head waiter gave us great recommendations on what steak to select, and which wine would go well with it. I was amazed at all of the little details including refolding my table cloth while I was away at the restroom.\n\nThe food was 5/5 - all of us ordered a medium-rare bone-in ribeye. It was the biggest and juiciest steak I've ever had. Quite unfortunate that I was not able to finish the last third, the serving was that large. Yes, the check for 4 people ended up being several hundred dollars but it was worth every single cent for the dining experience.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	lRbCfDSmDXFlOTZbLch8ow	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
UOo6ZANWjr_yhZcT5NZMaA	3	2016-10-31 00:00:00	First let me say that this has been my favorite Las Vegas restaurant for several years.  That is what makes this review so difficult for me to write.  My last two trips to Delmonico's have left me looking for a new favorite.  We were there Friday night for our anniversary.  We were seated at a table that was next table a food staging area.  We had servers all around our table all night  prepping food for other diners.  It was very irritating.  The food was ok but not great.  The service was terrible.  We asked for horseradish sauce when our steaks arrived and actually got it when we were just about to finish our meals.  We actually had to look for someone to refill our drinks on several occasions.  I love this place but I will not be back.  Our bill was over $400 for 4 people and I am ok with that but we got $75 Longhorn's type service and I cannot live with that.  Sorry Delmonico's.  I am out.  Need a new favorite Vegas restaurant.  Suggestions?	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	n9CdUzrBMZb-u6m1TruFSA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
UqaB6Q6kwb01Q8Lr2RI5vw	5	2012-01-16 00:00:00	Wow!!!! Delmonico is absolutely my favorite restaurant, period. I've been visiting them since 2002 and try and get there whenever I'm in Vegas.\n\nThe service is second to none. I don't know what the wait staff to guest ratio is, but it has to be 2-1. I also absolutely LOVE how they put every person's plate down at the exact same time, period. You're a party of ten? Then ten of Delmonico's finest serve you all at once. And man do they now their business. I've never had a recommendation be anything but excellent!\n\nThe food.... Did I say wow???? My personal favorite is the bone-in rib eye, but all of the meat is fantastic. I order mine rare, so it is easy to get a tough steak, but not here!!! It is just lie butter.... Yum.... The BBQ shrimp are amazing, and homemade truffle potato chips??? Wow.... I could go on and on.... Creme Brule is amazing, as is the bread pudding.\n\nI simply can't say enough about Delmonico's. It is simply worth every penny!!!!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	-3fMaL_ck0wzEsTZyz-mqA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
UqI4YpmKIoAzU9TFUYBk3g	5	2013-09-22 00:00:00	The Ben:  This is my steakhouse when I'm in Las Vegas. Why?  Well, I usually stay in the Palazzo, but they have some pretty amazing steaks.  They start you off with these fresh out of the oven dinner rolls that you can never get enough of, but watch out that you don't fill up on it.  The steaks are worth skipping some bread for.  I always go with the aged prime ribeye on the bone.   It never disappoints and this time since there is a ban of foie gras in Cali I opted to try it for the first time as a topper.  Please don't mock me for never trying the foie, well I can you can, but as a Yelper/foodie I had to try it for my street cred.  I thought it was okay, I just I'm not as much as a foodie as everybody else.  It was just some extra fat for my steak.  I would recommend the banana cream pie for dessert, it was amazing!  Bravo!\n\nThe Bad:  Only thing I would say it that you will be having a slow dinner.  I think we were there for a few hours.\n\nThe Ben:  Get the ribeye, pie and prepare for they long night of eating.	11	7	8	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	C-4a9xguoYZsmxXipo4p1Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
uqnH2CFtgdHzebTm0vugJw	5	2014-01-20 00:00:00	Such a wonderful place! Came here with a large party (11) and we had excellent service and food. I had the butternut squash ravioli appetizer as my entrée. It was absolutely delicious! Together with my salad it was the perfect amount of food.\n\nThe servers were extremely nice and accommodating for our large party. They served all the plates at once --  11 servers were gathered to set all of our plates down together. It was pretty cool! They also went out of their way to make sure one guest's meal was prepared gluten-free. \n\nThey were more than willing to do separate checks, for which we were extremely grateful.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	fL640F9UUOIFM6uTcJaT_w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
UraIsWitrhrD8--DwLzI7Q	5	2014-04-14 00:00:00	We had lunch at Delmonico Steakhouse in the Venetian on Saturday. When we arrived around 1:15 PM there were only two other tables occupied by diners, so we got plenty of attention from Adriana, who was very professional and helped to create a wonderful lunch experience for us.\n\nAs starters we ordered the Buttered Fresh Asparagus and Sauteed Wild Garlic Mushrooms The asparagus was delicious and the mushrooms were simply incredible. If you are a garlic lover you must try these mushrooms; we are and we believe we would make a return trip to the Delmonico just to order these again.\n\nWe then split a Grilled Skirt Steak Sandwich which featured wonderfully marinated, expertly cooked steak with a horseradish mayo that perfectly complemented the meat. The sandwich was outstanding, and there was no extra charge for splitting it and serving us each half on own own plate. \n\nWe then decided to go for it and split a piece of Emeril's famous Banana Cream Pie. This turned out to be not your ordinary banana cream pie in that there seemed to be no cream filling with the bananas. It looked like a vast number of differently shaped banana slices had been stacked on the crust in a kind of patchwork design, and yet they had done something to these bananas to make them deliciously sweet. There was a substantial amount of whipped cream on top of the slice which had been dusted with chocolate and drizzled with caramel. This pie was definitely a winner, and we regretted that we had no more room to sample some of their other desserts. \n\nWe are already planning a return visit to Delmonico Steakhouse next time we are in Vegas to further explore their menu and other items. Based on our lunch experience there we know we will be in for some fabulous flavors.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	j_TSUybr0hoAu7r_wyehEg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
utE2kG_sHpFYkolN_EOzJg	5	2011-04-26 00:00:00	I just arrived into Las Vegas tonight for a business trip and I headed straight to Delmonico's.  I have been wanting to try an Emeril Lagasse restaurant and in particular Delmonico's.\n\nI walked in and got seated quickly......it was 5pm and there were only a coulple tables that were taken.\n\nAfter looking over the menu, I ordered the lobster bisque, creamed corn and a bone in rib eye steak.  After ordering, I was given warm rolls which I quickly ate three of them.....they were fluffy, and super tasty with butter.\n\nThe lobster bisque was outstanding.....very creamy and full of lobster flavor.   I thought Craftsteak, Capital Grille and the Palm had the best lobster bisque....Delmonico's is right up there with being one of the best.\n\n\nThe steak came out perfect........juicy, tender and just the right amount of marbling.  The creamed corn was equally as good as the steak and bisque.  It was sweet....not too creamy.....super yummy.\n\nFor desert, I had the banana cream pie......a super, super pie filled with banana cream, whipped cream and tons of bananas.\n\nOverall, one of my best steak meals...ever!\n\nThe service was excellent and the ambiance/decor was very, very romantic.  A great place for a Valentines or Anniversary dinner!\n\nI will be back.....one of the best on the Strip!	7	2	4	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	SIpBqzGhRM7T5cDFiuIryg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
UTTDA3FVTs037eyiqX3xRw	3	2012-01-23 00:00:00	Love their cream corn & BBQ shrimp! Service was top-notch, friendly and attentive. You can split the bone-in rib eye if you plan on ordering appetizers, sides & dessert, plenty of food for two!

We enjoyed a seafood tower to start (fantastic) and for the main courses a few shared the Chateaubriand ("it was unbelievable!") and others had the Ahi Tuna ("excellent!").  \n\nIn short - it was an excellent meal!

They operate on a team-style of service, though our main server, I believe his name was Mike was fantastic. Started a little slow, but we went above and beyond my expectations! Started with a bottle of champagne and then a bottle of red with dinner. They keep the bottles for you off the table, so you never pour on your own and your drink is never empty. Though we may have over-ordered the table-side Caesar and table-side chateaubriand were phenomenal. Perfectly prepared and delicious. I could not have enjoyed myself more!

UyvH-_prOg7Fdrps6Uhjiw	5	2015-03-17 00:00:00	We love this place.  We dined here on March 5, 2015.  It holds a special place in our hearts.  We started with the caesar salad for two which was prepared table side, so fresh and good.  The steaks are always better than we remember.  We had the bone in ribeyes medium rare and they melted in our mouths.  The desserts are always fantastic too.  We went here on our yearly Vegas trip which we do for our half anniversary every year.  Can not say enough about this restaurant!  Love love.  There was one not so great side dish and it seemed like it was only ours....the potato au gratin was burnt and dry, not a good combo and we should have sent it back.  Everyone else's that went by our table looked fantastic.  Our bad, we should have sent it back....but o well...just don't order that dish.  We had a great evening and the service was excellent as always.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	7RzTqNLBK-Wv60XuUmN2og	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I had the Bone-in Ribeye and it was by far the best steak I've ever head, juicy and tender, and everything you want in a steak.  I ordered some sides but wasn't even necessary, I couldn't even finish the steak!  Service was great.  A little on the pricey side but worth spending the money at least once.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	qRUSzHSMW-mNI4cAvCsRpQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
UzY8An_QcWx5UzHqgzfq7Q	5	2013-12-03 00:00:00	This is the 3rd time we've been to Delmonico & honestly, it keeps getting better! The service is top notch.  Our servers were on top of everything but not intrusive & the manager, Rene, was friendly  & knowledgeable about all aspects of the restaurant.  For our appetizers, we had oysters on the 1/2 shell, wilted spinach salad & heirloom tomato soup.  All were yummy.  We've come to realize that splitting a steak between 3 people is the way to go.  In the past, half our steak would go to waste as these steaks are huge!  We split a bone in ribeye and there was still a couple of pieces left over. The reason you get so full is because the sides at Delmonico are out of this world! This time around we had the potatoes au gratin, creamed spinach & creamed corn.  I could make a meal on Delmonico side dishes alone - they're that good!  While they've served up delicious desserts in the past (what? No more bread pudding?), we just didn't have room for dessert this time.  I can't wait until we are back in Vegas again & have the time to stop by this gem of a restaurant.  It's true culinary bliss!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	h8vvO7v710hiGkA05u8N0A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
V0VgYMja12M5Ezf615JchQ	2	2013-06-18 00:00:00	I did an all Venetian restaurant tour on my most recent Vegas trip.  I had dinner here the second night of my stay.\n\nWe ordered the gnocchi w/ black truffles to start ($25).  For my entree I had a bone-in ribeye w/ foie gras ($72 - $52 for the steak & $20 for the foie gras), my friend had the regular ribeye ($48), and on the side we had haricot vert almondine ($11) & fingerling potatoes ($12).  \n\nThe gnocchi was very good.  It had a nice crisp and the truffles accented the taste of the potatoes in the gnocchi very well:  4 Stars.  Unfortunately, the steak was not very good.  It was fatty, chewy in some spots and not that flavorful.  The waiter stated that Delmonico's has the best steaks in town.  Sorry, but I have had better steaks at STK and T-Bonz in Summerlin:  2 Stars.  The foie gras was OK.  It was nice to see it on the menu because you can't find it in CA.  However, I was expecting more crisp:  3 Stars.  The haricot vert was just OK too.  The beans were crispy and there were plenty of almonds, but other than that they were nothing to remember:  3 Stars.  Lastly, the fingerling potatoes were too salty, and I am one who generally doesn't notice when dishes are too salty.  The waiter Ken did offer to make a new batch, but the food took a long time to come out and we declined:  2 Stars.\n\nTo accompany the meal we had a bottle of COS Pithos Rosso 2008 from Sicily ($85). The winery describes the wine as superbly elegant, subtly meaty w/ a cherry fruit nose.  The palate is profound:  Elegant, pure and mineral with lovely spice and earth notes.  Some complexity, and a bit of tannic structure.  OK, perhaps too much self-promotion, but Delmonico has an extensive wine list at many price points.  The wine was excellent and went very well w/ all the dishes:  5 Stars.\n\nThe ambiance was sterile, but there was a good amount of space between the tables.  Unfortunately, the restrooms were lame.  It was quite a walk, there was no valet and only one stall and one urinal.  I had to wait and after I finished, the line was two deep:  2 Stars.  In addition, the service was not very good.  The entrees came at least 35 min after the first course.  Ken, our waiter never stopped by to check on us and let us know it would take a while.  He did redeem himself by agreeing to take the potatoes off the check.  However, he offered us a complimentary dessert and we chose expressos and my friend asked for sambuca also.  We were charged for the sambuca : XXX. If he didn't take the potatoes off the check, I would have given him 1 Star:  2 Stars.\n\nI will not return to Delmonico's the next time I am in Vegas, even though I can walk here from the Venetian where I always stay.  The steak was lousy, the bathroom is lame and the service sucked for an establishment of this caliber.  Word to Emeril:  You need to work on this restaurant - BAM!!!	17	15	14	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	o1_sfJ71nrq5QrF00v3Icw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
v2tT2cV2LmfetekxplWSNw	3	2014-06-02 00:00:00	We went to Delmonico's in the Palazzo/Venetian for a pre-theater dinner.  While nothing was bad, it wasn't a four or five star experience, either.  The service was competent, and the restaurant decor is definitely upscale.  \n\nThis is an Emeril restaurant, so they have some cajun/creole items on the menu along with steak and seafood.  I started with the Ahi and Salmon Tartare.  A nice starter served with a small cucumber salad, but nothing extraordinary.  The lobster bisque arrived after sitting on the pass for awhile, it seemed, as there was already a skin atop the soup.  It was a nice bisque, about what you'd expect at a steakhouse.  The petite iceberg wedge salad was, again, pretty standard with bacon and blue cheese.  I finished with the Halibut served over what they call vegetable risotto.  It was good; maybe a bit overcooked, but I enjoyed it.  \n\nThe rest of the table ordered appetizers and steaks, and while they said the steaks were good...no fireworks to speak of.  I did try a bit of my GF's ribeye, and was actually a bit surprised that it was lacking flavor in my opinion.  The ribeye is usually very flavorful, but this almost tasted like a filet; tender, but without any real steak pop and just a hint of gaminess.  \n\nOverall, especially for the price, I thought the food would have been a bit more inspired, but as it ended up it was just OK.  Not a place I'd steer anyone away from, since the menu is diverse and the wine list very respectable, but if you're looking for something really special, I don't think this really hits the mark.  There are certainly better steak and seafood restaurants in Vegas that are less, at, or a bit more than this price point that would be much better.  \n\nInterestingly enough, despite the restaurant's name...they had no Delmonico steak on the menu.  I thought that was a bit odd, as well.  :)	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	WIdUAxJqXKp2imC_BfcxMg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
V2xfDR3y47hRpGZLTr5Bjg	4	2013-05-28 00:00:00	I was a bit skeptical as usual to try a tv chef place, such as Emeril. But i wasn't disappointed after all. We started the evening with a pre drink at the bar which is a small but nice and up scale place. Then we both ordered starter and main course. I had the oyster platter and my friend and the shrimp bbq. The oyster were great, especially because it is the small size ones, more flavorful to me. I think the big hit was the shrimp which takes about 12 hours to make that special bbq sauce. Then we were recommended to try to the bone in ribeye as far as steak. We were going there for steaks to start with but this was definitely a hit. Steak was perfectly cooked, dry aged (8 weeks i think) and we had a lovely potato gratin to complement that. I wasn't a big fan of the corn side dish we ordered though. The waiter also suggested a nice red wine to complement that. Service was top notch with 3-4 servers always around you which is very appreciable. If you are in a mood for steak, i think this is one of the best option in Vegas for sure.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	VEp_VFuXdwv3zWJw1RLacw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
v87UTFds94GzrnJFLaPVZg	4	2012-06-23 00:00:00	Almost perfect except when they screwed up my steak order and made it well instead of medium. Staff was very understanding and quickly replaced my steak with the correct order (seriously, my table mates maybe got another one or two bites in before I had a new plate...so quick!) otherwise everything went well. At the end of the meal, my cousin asked for a tour of the kitchen (she's a CIA grad) and they let her check it out.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	5z587IBRnjCbo51IaHNPzQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
v8QPs6AaixrqXvC5rHqUrQ	4	2008-11-11 00:00:00	So when you go to a restaurant like this please expect a bit of a drawn out dinner, I think it was two and a half hours for our large party. Many said it was the best food they had in their life, and it was really wonderful. I will say that the appetizers had far more imagination than the main course which was a bit deflating. \n\nWe went after a long day at a convection and most of us were tired and slightly delirious so the service being a tad slow made the dinner feel very much like The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover. They do the thing where they set all the plates at once and the glasses never went empty and the wine list is to die for, they had a 15000 dessert wine that dated before the Titanic. \n\nOne star is really for the main course not living up the expectations set previously.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	---1lKK3aKOuomHnwAkAow	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
VazgeXVEcRImzFXUPWMBJA	4	2009-11-05 00:00:00	Really good steakhouse! We went there for our friend's birthday. The environment is nice but maybe a tiny bit noisier as I expected. My boyfriend and I ordered a Lobster Bisque to share, which was good but not especially exciting. He ordered a Filet Mignon, I believe, and was fantastic! It literally melted in my mouth and we were able to cut it with a butter knife.. so tender! I ordered a season entree - Grilled halibut on a bed of lumbcrab meat w/ some kind of aioli. It was alright... the crab was tasty but the fish was a bit dry... \n\nOur friend ordered the Tournedos au Poivre and his girlfriend ordered the Ribeye. The Ribeye was huge for the price! We also ordered a couple of sides to share - New Orleans Creamed Spinach, Sauteed Garlic Mushrooms and Truffle Parmesan Potato Chips. I have to say the mushrooms was really good! Didn't really care for the creamed spinach because it was too heavy for me. The chips was good, too, but I wanted to compare it to Alexander's Truffle oil fries... That's one of my future plans =P\n\nOverall, I think the steaks are worth the price. Other stuff are good but not extremely exciting.... I guess you should always go for the steaks at a steakhouse!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	2ky397e3Ym5q8tY4P2gAgA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

vC7zszPwO5wFZSMIE8LtEA	3	2011-07-04 00:00:00	Hmm, I thought this place was A-OK. I was surprise to learn its Emeril's restaurant. I mean, I have to say I have tasted better steaks. I got the rib-eye not knowing that it was huge and was really surprise when I saw it. I should have shared and thought the portion was great for 50 bucks. I ordered medium well, but it was redder than normal. I thought it was over seasoned. The potatoes were really good though. The service was okay--we had a big party and they accommodated us, but I felt that since we were a younger crowd than normal, they didn't give the best service they could. The server didn't really smile and forgot one of our checks and so we had to wait for a while to get it backs. \nThe people in my party that didn't get steak enjoyed their dishes. If I go next time, I wouldn't order steak but yet this is a steakhouse..	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	EIRBAYXCV3647N3ejEwkIA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
VC9G1487LgCSTlQoC2DDGg	5	2017-03-17 00:00:00	Had a great time here.  The private room in the back overlooking the kitchen was a great touch. The service was amazing. The bone in ribeye was fantastic. Cooked perfectly and was tender and flavorful. A scoop of melting butter sat on top of the ribeye. Everything was great. I loved the twice baked potato. It was tremendous. The portion was huge and had an amazing taste. Highly recommend it. Great wine list. Great variety. The lower priced wines were good and the more expensive wines were vast and impressive. The sommelier was so helpful and knowledgeable. We had a great discussion and were able to identify the best wine for me, for this meal.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	j-vKwHxd5b_GXeMDbwukFw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
VcJ7QDmIh026uREBDrIp_A	5	2017-03-11 00:00:00	Perfect service every time! Everything is good and some things great! We were a party of 3 and two ordered ribeyes and I ordered bone in filet. We all ordered the spinach salad. All items are Ordered alacarte but all of the side items are plenty to split 2/3 ways easily. This time we got the corn it is creamy with a tiny kick of chili peppers and a crunch on top of Panko crumbs. The corn is absolutely delicious! The asparagus is just plain steamed asparagus but it is good too. I have had the spinach, the potatoes, the mushrooms, and the grits in the past, all great but this corn was soooo very good. The popovers are served just after drink orders but they are not replenished or served in a basket. Your back up server will just make one round so they are served fresh and warm. If you want more you will have to ask. \nThis time we were not served a complimentary mini appetizer as we had always been served in the past years. We did see other tables served this though. Perhaps because we delayed our ordering due to waiting on drinks and our conversation time. \nDessert was the pecan pie. This pecan pie is not the icky sweet oozy gooey pie that I am used to. This one is more tart like, not so sweet or gooey st all. The crust is more cookie like. It was good but I would probably not get this again.  We will stick to the delicious duck egg brûlée or the banana cream pie next time.	2	0	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	A4MFPn61BQzB0dHyXcPDeQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

vd7bfgXvrdi8wUsQYcWwkw	2	2010-05-03 00:00:00	Service was pretty good, food was pretty mediocre.  For the price, they get 2/5 stars.  I've had much better food before at this price point, and I've had much better steaks for much less (like the porterhouse at the Applebee's in Rutland, VT, for example).\n\nThe main dings are from:\n1.  The steak was overcooked.  No better way to ruin a steak than to overcook it.  I ordered my steak medium-rare and it came out medium-well.  Maybe I shouldn't have assumed that a pricey steak house would always err on the side of raw, because they did the opposite.  To me, a steak that is cooked all the way through but still pink (as opposed to deep uncooked red) and having the same dry texture as well done is a medium-well, not a medium-rare.\n2.  The sides weren't done well.  The asparagus that we ordered was overcooked (soft and limp to the point that it was hard to pick a piece up with the fork).  The potatoes seemed overdone (the cheese was dried out instead of cheesy).  I do better asparagus at home and you can find better potatoes almost anywhere.  The cream corn w/ cheese was good, but nowhere near as good as the divey korean chicken place back home.\n\nThey do have a large vine list.  They had a lot of European wines, although I'm not very familiar with them.  I was looking for South American wines.  I was a bit surprised that they had Malbec from Chile, but no Carmenere.  \n\nThe main upsides are service and atmosphere.  The staff is very precise and they pay attention to little details like putting your napkin back in place when you get up and making sure all the plates arrive at the table simultaneously (although this trick would work better if I didn't see them swarming by the trays next to our table for two minutes trying to orchestrate the exercise for our table of 11).\n\nOverall, if you're looking more for the atmosphere and experience and care less about the food, check it out.  If you really want a great steak, you may be disappointed.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	hO_bX_k5t8pZhZTzVsLopw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

VFc8U3iv22msl-Aeef0P8A	5	2017-05-08 00:00:00	Not really sure why I waited so long to write my review, however here it is.  In one word.  Fabulous.  It has always been a dream of mine to come here.  So, my fiance booked us a trip and made it happy (love him).  We arrived and was seated right away.  We had our first experience of a  two person wait staff attending to us.  The meal was superb.  I had salmon and sides and my fiance had the rib eye and sides.  The meal was flawless.  We had good conversation with the wait staff to the point where when we discussed how we were from MD, he introduced us to another staff member (who wanted to meet us because she was from our area too).  We had great conversation.  I usually don't get dessert when I'm out because I'm usually too stuffed to do so, but the wait staff insisted and comped it because it was my birthday.  Just to mention, we had to change our initial reservation time and I was worried thinking we wouldn't be accommodated but we did so with no issues.  This restaurant is located in the Venetian Hotel and depending on where you come in at, may take a little while to get to.  The other part of the place that was hard to navigate to was the restrooms, it was to the right of the seating area down the hall and if I remember correctly, you pass by/can see inside of the kitchen on the way.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	rguvZPbj10fGIa7bk3ASZQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I was very surprised that they even carried this at such a "high end" restaurant.\n\nThe only saving grace was their truffle and parmesan potato chips.  Although it looked like dish from the local sports bar, it tasted great.\n\nI had the greatest time having dinner here, but I'd have to say it was about the company and not the food.  Totally not worth the money.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	IKBsjc39iy6VklmJ0lC6PA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Gotta get the rib eye here! Bone in or bone out... doesn't matter. Both really good. All the sides were also fantastic. If I had to pick one the mushrooms would probably be my favorite. The creamed corn was also really really good. Mashed potatoes good but not your socks off like the other things.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	v7gsMsxQrQlQ4-JCefu4gg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
VGqJMCXEHs3C2Jp7x9ISeQ	4	2010-10-19 00:00:00	I've watched Emeril on the FoodNetwork Channel for years.. I even used to tape his shows through my VCR (yes VHS tapes). I have heard of this place through a friend that told me that everytime his brother goes to Vegas he eats here. So, when I found out that it was Emeril's Restaurant, I was even more eager to try this place! Well, I finally had the chance to experience this restaurant, whose owner is one of the most enthusiastic and giddy chef's around! \n\nI had made reservations a couple hours prior and when we got there we were seated within seconds. Place was pretty occupied with plenty of men dressed in suits, a few couples and  loud crowds that had their drunken voices echoing throughout the restaurant. All the staff members were well postured with every movement from pouring drinks to picking up finished plates off the table. The place is contemporary, a minimalist dream with large and very comfortable dining chairs.\n\nThe order:\n\nVine-Ripened Tomato Salad: Tomatoes were juicy, plump and tasted so fresh. The tomatoes combined with the red onion, fresh mozzarella, extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar = 4.5/5 stars\n\nLobster Bisque: Wow! I've had this dish a couple other times at other fancy restaurants and this one just blew those away! The flavor of the soup was smooth and had just the right amount of lobster flavor, not rich at all. Came with a few pieces of lobster.. what a tease! \n\nPotato Gratin: came in a mini pan with the whole top completely lightly crusted brown. I grabbed my fork, broke into the soft crust and scooped up bite with a little bit of everything on it (crust,  potato and cheese). One of the better potato side dishes I've ever had!\n\nCreamed Corn Gratinee: also came in a mini pan with a crumble/breaded top layer. The breading went well with the corn but overall it was just good.\n\nBone In Rib Steak: Server asked me if I wanted Emeril's Essence and slice of butter placed on my steak. I told him that I wanted it the way it should be served.. Shortly, the steak was finally served with a thin slice of butter with the evident Emeril Magic Dust "BAM!" sprinkled over  the meat. It was a healthy portion and did look Fantasteak! Not the softest steaks I've had but had a Nice Chew, not the juiciest but was far from dry, overall had a very well rounded quality to it. No Complaints! \n\nEmeril's Banana Cream Pie: Came Tall with layers whip cream, generous amount of banana slices, banana cream and thin crust. There was also chocolate sprinkled/shavings  on top and caramel spread on the bottom. A great way to finish a fine dinner! \n\n*Also had a glass of some French Honey Wine to compliment the pie, it was on the sweeter side but worth trying.\n\nBeing A FAN of Emeril For Years, Had High Expectations.. The Place Delivered but Not with Flying Colors..	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

vKHyTEAP28xGDCfSTaE_ug	5	2011-10-27 00:00:00	I always make time to treat myself to a dinner at Delmonico's when I visit Las Vegas.  It has the best filet I have ever tasted; flavorful and tender. They are well known for their rib-eye, and although I have never eaten it, my husband loves it.  They are also known their New Orleans BBQ Shrimp appetizer and it is delicious (I try to make it at home.)  There are tasty desert selections and wine ranging from $30 to $50,000.  \n\nThe front room tends to be noisy since everyone has to pass through it at some point.  Request a table by the kitchen or along the right side of the room.  And if you are a very special person, you can reserve the chefs table in the kitchen.  Either way, make reservations!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	qI2I6gNtkIrLijgsJ-YX6Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Vl3vhgR12Q1A2s-HnAU9XQ	3	2016-10-17 00:00:00	We're locals so our restaurants standards are pretty high. The restaurant was pleasant but nothing exciting in the decor department. Service was good, the menu pedestrian, seafood and steak. The lobster bisque was average, I've had better, but the wilted spinach salad was exceptional. My Chilean sea bass was okay, but again, not fabulous. My husband's rib eye was below average at best, I've cooked better at home. The twice baked potato was ok, but the shell was dry and hard. The dessert special was cheesecake, which was fine, but the banana cream pie was again, nothing to brag about. At this price point, too many other fine choices to bother with this place again.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	bgPPK4HoRils7gACkHmh-Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The gumbo 100% authentic.  Her crab stuffed lobster tail was heavenly.  My bone-in ribeye was simply perfect..

For all that time I've been telling her about Emeril's bananna cream pie, while I made it for her from one of his cookbooks.\n\nBut now she's had the real thing and agrees it really is the best she's ever tasted. Her comment to our kids said it all: "at least Dad tried."\n\nWith a very special wine, $800 for two.  We will return.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	KdRUbbdZ4GxjV4h2BeZH9w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I was full after the first piece, but I had to finish it because it was perfectly cooked. I also ordered a side of steamed asparagus and it was cooked with the right amount of salt and butter. I couldn't ask for anything else better prepared.\n\nGreat steaks and seafood.

That means a lot because I never thought anything could outdo my taste buds over Hugo's Cellar (which I still love very much). The service was excellent. We had reservations and were seated promptly.\nI enjoyed the Asparagus with Prosciutto wrapped around it they brought to the table. We must have had 3 different people checking on us. As I stated I had the Filet and Garlic Smashed Potatoes. The Filet melted in my mouth it was just so darn tender and flavorful.\n\nIt was almost $55 for my portion and well worth it.

VS0-T5DKS6Vfkzt79eieTA	2	2015-10-06 00:00:00	Delmonico is located within the Venetian on the casino floor. \n\nThe ambiance is elegant and classy. This restaurant is great for a beautiful and romantic dinner. There may be a wait if you have not made reservations so make sure to call ahead and reserve a corner table (for people watching of course). - Not for the food.\n\nThe service was great! If my review were only for the service this would be an easy 5 star rating. There are two main servers, plus water, and wine servers as well. I always love this added touch because it makes for better service. \n\nNow to the real rating. The FOOD (insert dramatic music in background).\n \nLet's just say the bill came out to roughly $300 and we were not the least bit impressed. \nThe only notable item was the wine which was delicious, very smooth, a quaint merlot to go well with our steaks.. \nThat was about it though.\n\nThe mashed potatoes were too globby,  the mushrooms were simply made in a butter sauce that tasted, well, tasted buttery. \nThere was no essence action and considering this steakhouse is a reflection of Emeril- I'm not impressed. Where's the flavor Emeri?!? \nMy steak was ordered medium - my steak came out well done and tough. There were no add ons to compliment the steak, perhaps a dry rub, a sauce maybe? I asked for lemon to zest my steak, considering I still had every intention of eating it  (Yes, hunger is real when you're in Vegas on the weekend).. but what disappointed me the most were the cocktail lemon wedges which I received from our server.. \nIt was more of an, "Are you kidding me? Delmonico cannot afford to add simple cheesecloth, or a gauze socks around half lemons and here I am cashing out 300 bucks!?"\n\nI try my best to give each business the best reflection possible, but in all fairness Delmonico greatly lagged. I have definitely had better steak, better sides, and most definitely better dessert elsewhere- most of all a steak that is served with proper sides of lemon!\n\nAlso, incase you do end up here please also skip the chocolate cake. The pistachio ice cream does not compliment this desert one bit. I'm still in awe of the ratings others have given this restaurant. The food is off, and in all fairness at the end of the day I cannot EAT the service. I prefer actual tangible, consumable, well dressed and cooked morsels of, yep you got it, FOOD. \n\nSorry Yelpers- but this restaurant is not worth a return. 2 Stars.	8	6	4	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	nlmUnHiLOKfH_7puy_Hm2A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

After losing an undisclosed amount of money, I wasn't really in the mood to eat yet another expensive meal; however...\n\nI was prepared for high prices and adequate food but my oh my was I in for a pleasant surprise... at least on 50% of the expectations.  Food Fabulous and Prices were indeed expensive but I have to say worth the full experience.\n\nMy husband shared the Chateaubriand Carved Tableside for Two, Asparagus and Garlic Smashed Potatoes for  $110 - Same as the Filet however, it comes with sides and costs less.  It was prepared PERFECTLY and was delicious from the first bite to the last bite.  \n\nOther sides folks had and loved were: New Orleans Creamed Spinach;  Twice Baked Potato with Bacon and Vermont Cheddar\nThe wine we chose (we asked for a med-full bodied red with a smooth finish and complex aromas that didn't cost more than $100 or $1000 (see photo of wine prices)  He actually suggested something for around $60 or so and it was exquisite!  \nChappellet Mountain Cuvee 2009.\n\nAdd this to your to do list in Vegas and go hungry!!

vsJKWSOb_O0_3TV6clgV4w	5	2015-06-25 00:00:00	This place is by far the best restaurant for impeccable service and incredible food. From start to finish, EVERYTHING was spot on. Nobody is perfect, but this place... this place is the definition of Perfection. From the smiling hostesses to the personable server, Frank, that not only was warm and welcoming, but even wholeheartedly supported their participation for Restaurant Week. Even explained what Three Square was all about and let us know that the portion of each meal is donated to help the hunger. He genuinely wanted us to participate and even had the RW menu to show us when we sat down. Not like some other steakhouse server *coughcough (Smith&W) that hid this menu unless you mention it and when you do, they treat you cold as winter. Not at this place, you feel like family or a special guest at someone's house. And this is just lunch for crying out loud. Service felt like you're the most important person in the world. Amazing.\n\nFrank was delightful to have as our server. He was informative, attentive, enthusiastic, and just had this kind, easy going presence about him. Getting to know my Father and I throughout our dining experience. It was so nice to have a server that actually wanted to know more about their guests. He was thrilled that we came for Restaurant Week and when I started ordering, he would say.. that's my favorite too love the burrata cheese or after I ordered the Prime hamburgers.. he would say.. that burger is so juicy and delicious, you'll love it. It felt so good that the server is all for it. Even his assistant said thank you each time she took a dish or utensils away. So sweet and kind!\n\nThe goods... Everything. There wasn't a single thing that was mediocre. Complimentary bread was like a light croissant mixed with herbs. The appetizers.. My Father had the Heirloom Tomato Soup With Grilled Ricotta Cheese Sandwich, which was so good.. I didn't even get a chance to taste not even one bite of it. He was enjoying it so much that I didn't have the heart to interrupt his food romance. Sh*t. I just wanted one bite!!! *sigh OH well.. I ended up enjoying the Vine-Ripened Heirloom Tomato Salad with my favorite Burrata Cheese, Red onion, Balsamic Vinegar, and Torn Local Basil. It was oh so freshly made. That burrata cheese just makes my day. Loved every single bite of it.\n\nIf you come here for RW... a must try.. DELMONICO'S PRIME HAMBURGER. On Toasted Brioche Roll With Fries, Cheddar Cheese, and Bacon. I never in my life had a hamburger like this one. It was first class, first rate, love at first bite. Outstanding flavors. Even the sesame seed bun tasted buttery and oh so soft. So good, so good, unbelievably Deeeeelicious. The size of this burger was enormous. My Father had to cut it up like a steak to eat it. Me, on the other hand ate it like a champ. I was full from eating only half of it, so was my Father. The presentation itself was like art. Even cutting it in half was beautiful. I'll be daydreaming about this burger probably for the rest of my life. My Father kept on laughing, either from the sight of happiness of seeing this magnificent burger or he can't get over how huge this is. Either way, he was enjoying himself and that makes me extremely happy to see. We, both had a splendid time here. \n\nBoth desserts were wonderful.  The Banana Cream Pie Parfait with Caramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings, Whipped Cream, and Graham Crumbs had this cooling effect. It's a great sweet summer treat. Thick cream. The Traditional Bread Pudding With Warm Caramel Pecan Sauce was soothing. Generous amount of pecans. It was a seal deal to a great meal.\n\nAfter the whole dining experience, this restaurant now tops as one of my favorite places in Vegas. I never had a burger impress me until today. Superb!!! Fantastic service, food, and ambiance. Lovelovelove this place :)	8	4	6	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	HVJgTH5qu0goywOHNpOjPA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
vtAdHK-joe4RpuVElOnqlA	5	2009-05-26 00:00:00	Being that I am in real estate, I can't tell you how excited I was to be treated to a chi-chi expensive dinner that probably ended up costing the equivalent to what I budget for two weeks of groceries...per person, mind you!\n\nI was in town for a work conference and one of our clients was gracious enough to invite all of his brokers to dinner. \n\nI'm not much of a carnivore but..when in Rome! It would be plain dumb of me to choose fish in a place known for their steak. That would be like ordering a hamburger at a Chinese restaurant.\n\nHere's the nitty gritty:\n\nStarter: \nCaesar Salad (made table side for 2): Shared w/ my co-worker. Best damn caesar salad I've ever had! They even mix the dressing fresh.\n\nMain Entree:\nFilet Mignon - medium rare: I think I died and went to beef heaven. So tender. So perfectly seasoned. So perfectly cooked! I'd be tempted to convert to carnivor-ism if I could eat like this more often.\n\nSides (a la carte):\nWe ordered a bunch for the table to share family style\nCreamed spinach - yum-o in my tum-o\nSauteed garlic mushrooms - shroomerific\nTruffle Parmesan potato chips - the classiest chips on the block & a hit at the table. We fought over the chip with the most truffles.\n\nDessert (again, shared family style):\nButterscotch pudding - not to sweet - just right but a taste was enough for me.\nChocolate Brioche Bread Pudding - I liked all the layers and it wasn't overly rich \n\nThe service was absolutely impeccable. Water glasses were never allowed to go half empty - they were promptly refilled by super observant waiters with bottled water in hand. Whenever someone left their chair to use the restroom, they came back to their napkin, neatly refolded and they'll pull your chair out for you to sit.\n\nI've never seen a more professional or attentive group - and that in itself justifies their high prices.\n\nCome here and dine like royalty!	2	2	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	CjvFxl6_7AK3lw5O49MN8g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
VtbKUCPk57gI7XQ5EhpMCQ	4	2009-10-07 00:00:00	We went for lunch.  And we were super early, the first ones there.  So maybe that contributed to the lack of enthusiasm that we started out with.  Our waiter was very nice but he didn't quite seem all there at first.  He asked me if I wanted a side of potatoes after I order a burger that comes with fries.  He walked away before we could order drinks and we had to call him back.\n\nBut after the initial turbulence, everyone settled in and we had a good meal.  I started with the gumbo which was perfectly fine, but it lacked a little soul for me.  For my entree I ordered the burger, as mentioned.  I just wasn't in the mood for steak for lunch or any of the other entrees for that matter.  \n\nThe burger was freakin' awesome.  It didn't have any weird toppings, just the standard lettuce, tomato, mayo maybe, whatever.  But this thing was a MONSTER.  That burger must have been about 3/4 of a pound.  It stood about 8 inches high and was delivered with a steak knife plunged into it to keep it all put together.  There was no way I was eating this thing with my hands.  This was a knife-and-forker all the way.  It was so much fun digging into that sexy hot beefy mama.  The fries were awesome too.  It's not often that I find a burger that I fall in love with but this is one that I will cherish forever.  5 star burger all the way.  Who needs a steak when you've got one of these babies.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	KVlLvyS2WNRgE1nochgMVg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
vvHi9OhJ0OHK_8EnIxwKYw	5	2010-08-06 00:00:00	Must say it was a very tasty steak. I had the bone-in ribeye steak medium rare with a side of asparagus and potatoes with a group of my friends. I would have to say the steak is definitely very juicy and rich with flavors. It was dry at all and surprisingly the flavors were consistent through every bite. I'll definitely go back for seconds if I'm ever in Vegas. Lets just say I will because the Palazzo is an awesome hotel to stay at.\n\nThe waiter was very helpful and on the ball.  I had the best meal why? because my entire trip was free. Thank you Vegas and Thank you Palazzo.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	aSbPx1DDyJ29FNaMMTn2Xg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
VVOS3QxZOxDG3qfxX1e8_Q	5	2009-01-08 00:00:00	Last time I was in Vegas I dined here for a birthday occasion.  I made the reservations in advance and when I arrived the Host gave me the option of waiting for the rest of our party or being seated right away.  Right from the start they were very accommodating and the service was excellent from seating to enjoying our dessert. \n\nI ordered the Chateaubriand and at first glance was not as impressed as my friend ordered the bone in rib steak which looked amazing. But after the first bite I was sold, the chateaubriand was extremely tender and had tremendous flavor.  I also sampled a piece of my friend's steak but actually preferred my chateaubriand. \n\nThe staff also made our experience memorable as the chef prepared complimentary appetizers for everyone and single dessert w/candle for the birthday celebrant.	3	1	4	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	qHe62_xv6DyripSqnCtHqw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
vWCLjnpa2dN0cDxhH5UZVw	4	2009-08-17 00:00:00	I am pretty critical when it comes to steak.  After sinking my teeth into my first pricey steak years ago.. I instantly understood why people pay top dollar for delicious cow.\n\nGreat option if you are in the Venetian/Palazzo.  See, I didn't plan on leaving the hotel after I arrived.\n\nHad a special that night.. ribeye with chanterelle mushrooms and foie gras.  I don't even like aged steak.. but it was amazing!\n\nAnd the best part was... all 10 of our steaks arrived at the same time.. 10 waiters to take 10  of them out.  If that's not awesome.. I don't know what is.\n\nThey also bring out ice cream for special bday boys and girls.  Delish!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	z_9oeZ5aN8g8AzPNENht8w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
vXzcnQIjeCjZCNjmZXsuhg	5	2012-04-29 00:00:00	I've never had a meal experience like what I had at Delmonico's. Me and a buddy were in Vegas for the first time and decided we wanted to go out for a good steak dinner. I asked for recommendations from people and settled on Delmonico's. I made reservations the Monday before the Thursday we went to dinner. I checked out the menu ahead of time and was not surprised to see the pretty high prices., I was confident though that we were gonna get what we paid for. \nWe arrived about 45 minutes before the reservation time and had a couple beers in the lounge. $6 for a Bud Light was pretty reasonable for this atmosphere. We were seated promptly at 7 and that's where things got impressive. The dining area is secluded, you have no idea you are in a casino, which is great. We were greeted by one of our 3 waiters and offered the wine menu. Neither of us drink wine, but I could tell the selection was awesome. \nWe ordered the truffle and Parmesan potato chips and bowls of the gumbo. Both were excellent, Emeril knows gumbo. I ordered the bone-in ribeye and my buddy got the filet. We also got the potato gratin and a twice baked potato. The sides are ala carte and family style. They were some of the best potatoes we had ever had. As for the steaks, they were both the greatest steaks we had ever had! No sauce is necessary for these babies. After dinner I had the banana cream pie, which was exceptional. My buddy had the cheesecake and said it was awesome. \nOverall I can not speak highly enough of the dining experie nce at Delmonico's. The professional staff, excellent atmosphere, and amazing food make Delmonico's a place I will go to again.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	XBDdatICQD6IL9jfvuWBPw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
vyaZbtXU6GxrCV96CLAEDw	4	2016-01-06 00:00:00	All the years we've been staying at the Palazzo, and we finally make it to Delmonico! Sort of. For our personal experience, maybe 3.5 stars, but I'd go back, as I think some things were specific to our visit and I think the restaurant can do better. \n\nJim G. and I stopped in at the bar for a spot of lunch. The bartender was often friendly, but sometimes seemed a bit confused or overwhelmed.  Turned out, he was new. Some of that is forgivable, but it wasn't busy at the bar, so some of it suggests that he's maybe not the best bartender in general.  Perhaps he was having an off day.  \n\nThe cocktails were interesting and well-crafted but, in some cases (like the Bronte Sisters), the focus seemed so much on presentation that the actual drink part of the drink was missing. The full copper mug of crushed ice left me with a tiny, tiny drink for $16. The wine list is incredibly extensive and led me to a surprising error.  The way it's printed, it sometimes leads the eye to the wrong price, as the name of the wine and the price don't visually seem to be on the same line.  The wine we ordered was great, as I knew it would be, but it was not at the great price I thought it was. Nice surprise for us on the bill when it was 2.5x more! Technically, not their fault, but it feels like it wasn't an accident on their part. It was lunch; not like I already had been drinking!\n\nOnion soup was awesome! Get some, for real! Very dark roux, super flavorful cheese. We shared a steak which was not quite the size our bartender told us it would be (ounces aren't on the menu) but was prepared nicely. The steaks (all except Wagyu) are prepared cajun style, so expect a different flavor profile than your traditional steak. \n\nGood food, but the bar needs more energy (maybe a bit of music?) and a bit of tweaking with the bartender. Maybe an evening trip will do the place more justice.	2	2	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	-lh59ko3dxChBSZ9U7LfUw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
VyehUmce7FrrBV1V-_a6ag	3	2016-12-05 00:00:00	3.5 stars - above average steakhouse, amazing service, loud. Food highlights: free popovers, lobster bisque. \n\n* Popovers - 5 stars: The BEST, small, light, airy, chewy, you could almost stuff the entire thing in your mouth. I've had good popovers at NM, but like the texture and size of these more. AND they give you a huge plate of softened salted butter - WINNER.\n* Lobster Bisque - 4.5 stars: One of the better lobster bisque's I've had! Great overall flavor, rich and decadent.\n* Side of mushrooms, creamed corn, fingerling potatoes - 3.5 stars: All of these were good. 3 kinds of mushrooms cooked generously in butter, my favorite. Followed by the creamed corn, very different with a strong jalapeno flavor. Fingerling potatoes standard.\n* Banana Cream Pie - 3.5 stars: Emerill's famous banana cream pie is huge - stacked high with chunks of fresh banana. The cream needed more banana flavor, seemed overwhipped, and the crust could've been more buttery. Was still good though.\n* Key Lime Pie - 3.5 stars: Really good key lime pie on an excellent crust, a little too sweet for me though.\n* German chocolate cake - 2 stars: Cake tasted airy, reminded me of box cake. Prefer Duncan Hines (sorry!).\n* Chateaubriand - 2.5 stars: Had an incredibly tender well-seasoned Tomahawk at Beauty and Essex, and in close second was Carnevino's. The Chateaubriand is a hunk of meat for two, sliced and cooked tableside. The meat was tender, but the texture kind of reminded me of a pot roast (not a fan), and it had a bit of a weird, gamey flavor....Recommend sticking with the ribeye.	4	1	5	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	5gbkhlWANGVzQYi_0m3vOQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
VyFafjFXHW6M0oWDcHbc1g	4	2009-05-24 00:00:00	Our experience at Delmonico's was good but just a tad bit disappointing so I can't give them 5 stars.    It's not that service was bad, in fact, it was better than most other restaurants but it was not up to the standards that I've come to expect from Emeril's server teams.\n\nThe food was wonderful, as always, and we'll definitely be back for another visit.     The banana cream pie alone is worth a visit - it's ruined us for eating it anywhere else, ever!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	uQEqsxqT3U6Ll1dsnqst-w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
VYOTJ1nM5h1_aQ4nSp_S8A	4	2015-06-22 00:00:00	A high end steakhouse is about the entire experience not just the quality of the steak. The bone in ribeye was a 5 star steak, really really tasty. Wife had the pork chop and it was out of this world. Service was also good and the place was affordable as far as Vegas steakhouses go. However, the overall experience was 3 star. The place had no energy on a Friday night. Light crowd, we were put in a dark corner right next to a bunch of other people when the restaurant was half empty. Ceaser salad for 2 was $34, it was good but portion size was small. Baked potato was dry. Again, steak was incredible, rest of the experience was 3 stars. I prefer Stack steakhouse across the street at Mirage.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	L7d8PGGm6fzXMkxncE8Big	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The peppercorns added nothing, and I kept waiting for more flavor with every bite.\n\nThere was a group of 12 of us split into 2 6-top tables. Even though we ordered first, they got their meals before us.\n\nThe sides were nothing interesting. This is just another expensive Vegas restaurant where you pay for pretentiousness.	3	2	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ZABoX8_9iMuLa3OAl2Pt8Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

W4btyJj9eNPShIlqm_0etw	5	2014-04-06 00:00:00	Unbelievable. Delmonico's was an unforgettable experience from start to finish.  We went there with a group of six to celebrate a 30th birthday. We called two days in advance to make a reservation (you can do it on their website too).  \n\nWe arrived and were seated immediately and it was then that I realized that it would be a dining experience. We had 4-5 servers around out table at any given time. We were immediately served water, delicious little bread knots, and out drink orders were taken. I thought it was interesting that they did not give a drink menu, rather the server recited all drinks in the given category to each person (wines: red or white, beers: IPA or Stout etc). Then they reviewed the menu with us and took our orders. There were many specials available, and they brought us a sample of a cheese tomato pesto flat bread, on the house. \n\nThe meal took a good 20 minutes, but it was worth every second (and dollar!). I had a filet, which was prepared to perfection. Sides are a la carte, and family style. The green beans, potatos au gratin, and country smashed potatoes were to die for. Very very delicious.\n\nThis is hard to imagine, but the servers were almost too hovering. They filled your water after one or two sips. They definitely took care of us to any need. The prices are high, but worth it. Delmonico's is something I will always remember about Vegas.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	J11bdsitVHB2qr9OqmH26g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The food was swerved elegantly . We had the wilted spinach salad and the baby green salad. Both were wonderful and bursting with flavor. Then came the rib eye steaks! They were to die for. They were huge and very tender. The flavor was outstanding and they were both cooked to perfection. We were too full for desert but had to try the banana cream pie . Whatever you do don't miss it! One piece was plenty for two people to share. The best dining experience ever! Made out trip to Vegas extra special!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	W0t-FaeqaqUTgF-0MKM1Qg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
W5XaPL9jg3ILQwFkRcR89w	5	2014-09-28 00:00:00	This is solely for the Chef's Table experience.\n\nThe bar area, dining room, and professional wait service is on par with spendy steakhouses. The vibe is casual, yet classy and not stuffy or pretentious, but imma talk more about this other thing going on near the kitchen. \n\nIf you want to catch a glimpse of the restaurant's inner sanctum, with a backstage-VIP-behind-the-scene view of organized chaos that is a proper kitchen service (and willing to pay for the private room setting), then prepare for a premium dinner. Anyone with an unbent iPhone 6+ can snap selfies and food pics these days, but you need just a little more than reservations for this opportunity. \n\nOur group was ushered through the dining room and towards the kitchen door, then guided into a side room that was separated from the dining room area. Glass panels allowed us to see the various kitchen workstations. In this fishbowl room, it was cramped quarters, like dudes crammed into a submarine mess hall, but you kinda just get used to it and settle in for the experience. Battle stations!\n\nThe food (photos uploaded) was brought in by a team of waiters and chefs and placed in front of us in unison at every course. Each tasting was beautifully plated and delicious. Course after course was brought in, and they even paused mid-service to allow diners to return from their nicotine break before bringing in the next round of plates.\n\nAfter all these dinner courses, there isn't much room left in the tummy for dessert. I was expecting maybe something light and sweet to cleanse the palate. Suddenly, these giant platters of everything from the dessert menu appeared! It wasn't just one or two items. So much decadence and it was a surprisingly wonderful grand finale to a spectacular meal.\n\nFor the amount $$$$pent, we could've went for bottle service, made it rain, or get swindled at a rub-n-tug joint, but we indulged on a magical evening of delightful food pr0n. Would go again if I hit a Vegas jackpot.	7	4	4	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	gzE5dfmxNYj5y0fIJBVblQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Prices were a little higher then I think they should have been, but suitable given the restaurant and area.  Maybe Houston's just a better value for food, I don't know.  Doesn't matter anyway..\n\nWe started with an heirloom tomato salad which was quite good.  Truffle and parm chips were delicious as well and certainly something I've looked to duplicate at home.  Buffalo ribeye was a good change of pace as well from the typical Texas steak house offerings.  Really enjoyed the wine reduction with that.  Also sampled the filet which was pretty standard, well done however.\n\nWine selection was also fairly reasonable with options for everyone.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	VNTul0lABObAjZY1I34uHQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Servers were waiting around to cater to your needs, but not in that anxiety-inducing I'm watching over you way.\n\nThis was our vday pick and frankly i was glad they didn't have a fixed menu. Being at a steakhouse i felt obligated to get the steak! I was also very appreciative of the fact that I didn't have to eat mine drenched in butter. My ribeye had a very nice crust of charred creole seasoning, with a lovely red center. Those smashed potatoes could not have been any creamier! I love when they serve the potatoes in that little pot. Honey got the lamb and it was deliciously tender, it practically melted in my mouth. \n\nNothing out of the ordinary or spectacular, but a solid choice for date nite or a nice dinner out.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	LRQTlvVNh1u-vVEg_2-Nag	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

But we had a great experience.  The service was attentive but not intrusive.  Everything we ordered was delicious!  I started with the mixed greens salad and my husband got the shrimp cocktail appetizer.  I got the filet mignon and my husband got the bone in rib eye.  Both were cooked perfectly and very good, but not the best steaks we ever had.  We also got the sauteed mushrooms and country smashed potatoes for sides.  We couldn't fit in dessert.  The wine list, or book I should say, was the largest we've seen.  Definitely worth the trip and I would recommend it.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	uS85JCv-2CjIE3da3NVGwA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
WdYZMA0dkrsm-KKX_CxexQ	4	2015-02-03 00:00:00	First off, to make the most of your experience, you should know what to expect from Delmonico service by doing your Yelp homework. This place doesn't get a full 5 stars because of the service. \n\nIt's been a while since I've felt so insulted by a server. I don't even know his name since he didn't introduce himself, so I know him as the big guy with a beard. He was unfriendly and wrote us off immediately when the table next to us wanted to share half of their seafood tower with us (it's massive and delicious by the way... thank you amazing strangers from New Mexico!).\n\nWe were celebrating an anniversary and greeted warmly by the host stand, but while other Yelpers say that their servers brought them a scoop of sorbet to celebrate, we got nothing. So hold your server accountable to giving you the experience you deserve for the price tag you pay. He would have gotten 30% if he wasn't such a douche.\n\nONTO THE FOOD!\n- Bone-in ribeye: Duh, do as all 1100 Yelp reviews say and get this! Fantastic marbling with an amazing crust. And yes... share a steak and order some other stuff! \n\n- Fingerling potatoes- a light hint of rosemary and more potatoes than a patch on a farm. Really tasty and beautiful. Sides all seem easily shareable for four people.\n\n- Creamed spinach- Not too heavy on seasoning, but perfectly delicious and enjoyable. Perfect with the ribeye.\n\n- Lobster bisque- if you get this, I would highly recommend sharing. It's too rich and heavy to eat a whole bowl.\n\n- Penis-shaped pop-overs (as another Yelp reviewer notes)- Try a bite, but save room for appetizers!\n\nAt the end of the day, I would certainly come back for the food.

WiAlaaCExUlC7DKgZJjY2g	4	2010-08-29 00:00:00	We started off getting drinks at the bar as we waited for the rest of party to arrive.  Let me get this out, I love Spago and go there every time to meet my fav. chef, Eric Klein, and I was NOT impressed when the bartender starting dissing all the Wolfgang Puck restos.  I mean, I didn't like CUTthat much, but that's a diff review. So we kinda started off on the wrong foot. Nonetheless, the drinks were good. My boyfriend's mojito had a real sugar cane in it so I can't complain about that at all.\n\nI shared the 2 person fancy-shmancy made tableside Caesars salad and can only say that it tastes exactly like a caesar salad that would've been made in the kitchen.  I ordered the filet. Ate 1/2, passed it my boyfriend so he can finish it.  The wine selection was impressive. The bottle picked out was phenomenal and paired really well my entree.  I would recommend the sauteed mushrooms because everyone ordered a different side dish yet everyone ate my mushrooms so that should tell you something....	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	5-gXtqDOkj1ZBLIeV6OciQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

WLG9JSYS3WyaYFDG_JXzJQ	5	2011-09-14 00:00:00	My visit to Delmonico Steakhouse was in August for our annual Wedding Anniversary trip.  A few days ago, we received a postcard from Delmonico Steakhouse - from our waiter Michael Jackson :o)\nWhat a nice surprise!!  It was just a short note to say thank you for visiting their establishment and hope to see us soon.  \n\nA little late - But here's my review....\n\nLet me start off by saying.. I wasn't too sure about visiting Delmonico Steakhouse since there are sooooo many restaurants that I want to try every time I go to Vegas.  I think we've been to almost ALL the Steak houses in Vegas.  CUT and CRAFT.. some of our favorites.\n\nUpon arrival.. we were seated within 3 minutes - which is a GREAT start.  People that know me are well aware that I do not like waiting.  \nWe were directed to a nice booth area and my husband and I were able to sit by each other to "people watch". \n\nImmediately we were welcomed by our waiter, Michael Jackson.  We started off with 2 glasses of Chardonnay - Light and smooth. \nSince I wanted to try so many of the sides and apps.. I decided that I'd just share the steak with my husband..  \n\nSooo Here's what we got:\n1. Spinach Frisee Salad with Poached Egg and Candied Bacon\nReview:  I was pleasantly surprised that the poached egg was encased in Panko crust and DEEP FRIED.  The candied Bacon.. Amazeballs\n\n2. Baked Oysters\nReview:  6 lovely oysters Baked with Garlic/parsley/Parmeson  - What's not to love!!\n\n3. Fried Potato Chips with Truffle oil and Garlic\nReview: AMAZEBALLS!!! NOM NOM NOM  Need I say more\n\n4. Creamed Corn\nReview:  Creamy, Sweet but great texture\n\n5. Grilled Asparagus\nReview:  Grilled and seasoned to perfection\n\n6. Bone in Rib-Eye\nReview:  Seared perfectly.  Light Shade of pink - Just how we like it.\n\n7. Pecan Tart\nReview:  Amazing\n\nWe will definitely frequent Delmonico Steakhouse.  The Service, The Quality, The Experience.. \n\nAsk for Michael Jackson!!	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	v_1mWpAi20k425m_EvPzVg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

WMyXdSapU6qxkmpspDPb1A	2	2016-06-17 00:00:00	My husband and I were excited to go check out one of Emeril's restaurants but we were very disappointed with the experience!  The ambience is a little sterile and it seems like they forgot to put the art up on the walls.  I ordered the French Onion Soup expecting the brothy soup I've always know, but it was so thick it was almost inedible.  For my entree, I decided to try the Piedmontese Petit Filet Mignon because of the rave reviews.  When I finally took a bite, it tasted like a steak I could have gotten at Black Angus not one that I just paid $50 for.  It was a pretty thin cut of meat and was a little mealy.  My husband ordered the regular Filet Mignon, which was terribly over seasoned.  Our service was nothing special, but we weren't even told about some of the specials that we saw as we were walking out the door.  All in all, there are so many other wonderful places to eat in Las Vegas, I would have loved to spend the $200 I spent on this meal elsewhere!  Definitely a forgettable and regretful experience.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	H-cz4Iub9uEsaMwVzaG6oA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

wNzPIi8xGGOo58IliBTmtw	4	2016-07-31 00:00:00	TL;DR: Decent steakhouse that matches its price tag; what you might expect in 5 star Vegas hotels. Not a bad option if you have $60 to drop on steak. \n\nWhile this steakhouse might not be anything noteworthy apart from the celebrity status of its owner, Emeril Lagasse, it serves solid food for an albeit expensive price. To be fair, though, we need to recognize that it is located in a 5-star hotel on the Las Vegas strip, one of the most tourist-saturated areas on Earth, where you can expect to be overcharged for everything. That being said, this steakhouse does what every steakhouse should to a fair standard.\n\nThe service here is as good as you would expect at a fancy steakhouse. The free bread here is unusual, though; it seems to be a hollow roll formed by a shell of Pillsbury croissant dough, which isn't bad, but isn't especially good either. USDA Prime steaks go for around $50-$60, and are enough to feed 2 people, or one really hungry person. I ordered the steaks medium-rare, and they were cooked to order, maybe a hair closer to a medium. The steaks had a good charred crust, a mark of a good steak and something difficult to achieve at home. They offer two complimentary steak sauces, both of which pair well with the steak. I'm personally a fan of ribeye steaks and recommend that cut above anything else at a steakhouse like this one. Sides are typical, and the asparagus was nothing special but good as it was. \n\nWhile Emeril may never have set foot in this steakhouse, it certainly does not disappoint. While it may not be as great as some of the most famous steakhouse in NYC, Delmonico does a good job at serving beef in the middle of a touristy destination. While it probably isn't worth more than the effort of a short walk to get to, if you're staying at the Palazzo or Venetian and are looking for a fancy steak dinner, this restaurant is a solid option.	0	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Oqoc9euG-25PXo5-vlgs-w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

WRBnPHiE8RjN8xhxzY1Jyw	4	2014-10-22 00:00:00	Bone-in ribeye was the bomb.\n\nThey cook the steaks as precise as you could get for medium and medium rare lovers out there.  No need to temperature down when being asked in anticipation of the kitchen cooking the crap out of your steak, what you ask for is what you get.\n\nI was here was some buddies for a random Vegas trip and we decided to do it big at Delmonico.  The experience was great.  The ambiance is a little bit more on the "date night" side of the spectrum, but the service is awesome and the steaks and sides are delicious.  \n\nMake reservations and don't stress about the price, it's a special occasion.  Even if it's not a special occasion, it will be when you steak comes at exactly the right temperature.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	0P7ZcvobivIqLiZeYcnHaQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
wrW2h80aJ5dkvL7iD8QdDQ	5	2012-04-04 00:00:00	Another one of Emeril's top notch restaurants, this one being a steak connoisseur's paradise.  We booked the night before and got in before the traditional 7-7:30 dinner rush.  Service- top notch.  Mind you, everything is a la carte.I cant help but feel underdressed even though we were dressed well for the venue.  They have an insane wine list that goes on and on.  I had the bone-in ribeye which was done to perfection - medium rare.  We also had the creamed spinach and wild mushrooms.  So good we finished everything leaving little to no room for dessert.  Definitely should try the dessert since they all looked exceptional, especially Emeril's claim to fame Banana Cream Pie!	1	2	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ShSe4B4BaLr-jBbxHc76Xw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Wt2fX8WuJT-QxLpgyfGg2A	2	2015-10-15 00:00:00	Disappointing, expensive evening\n\nWe had the bone-in ribeye, creamed spinach, and grits.\n\nThe steak would have been fabulous without their special Cajun seasonings. As a Cajun born south of I-10, skip the special seasonings they take away from a great piece of meat.\n\nThe spinach was flavorless and formerly frozen. The cream sauce had too much flour. For the price, the spinach should have been fresh and the cream sauce needs improvement. \n\nThe grits were flavorless and crunchy. Unacceptable. Skip this side dish. Nothing else needs be said.\n\nSave your money and go some place else. I had high hopes and they were dashed.\n\nEmeril, you need to either take your name off of this restaurant or pay more attention to it! I expected better; you let me down.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	SQWpl-4txlb-gERqA43VwA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Popping my truffle oil cherry....Yum\nOk I've never had fancy schmancy gumbo. But here it was very pleasant and chic. I mean come on - GUMBO - I WANT PIECES OF MEAT AND SEAFOOD AND OKRA.....\nBone in RIB EYE - no more done than medium rare. Doesn't need any extra spices or sauces give me my meat plain. If I wanted it coated with jism. Well I can do it myself :)\nSteamed or grilled asparagus with hollandaise...Mmmmm\nI ate a lot...So I didn't have dessert like everyone else did. If I could I would have sucked on the bones. But that would have been a culinary faux paus. Bad Myke No sucking.....So How do they make the thick steak so dark and perfectly medium rare? Hmm...It's gotta be Keebler Elves performing magic.\nThe service is impeccable. I went to the bathroom and put my napkin on my chair - just to find it folded neatly on my table.

The service was phenomenal and the food tasted like fireworks in your mouth. \n\nI had the the bone-in rib eye...it just melted in your mouth and it wasn't overwhelming with steak sauce either. Just how I like my meat. I love and appreciate the taste of meat by itself. I personally feel steak sauces take away from the authenticity of the taste and the quality of the meat. My boyfriend had a crab salad and the doublecut kurobuta pork chop. I'm not a big fan of pork in general but this was a super delicious dish. \n\nUnfortunately, we did not have any appetizers or dessert because we were still full from the buffet we had for lunch.

I had the petite filet, which came with a side of blue crab hollandaise risotto. Unfortunately, it's not on the menu anymore. The hubs had the ribeye and said it was the best steak he'd ever eaten. We split a bottle of wine. Dinner was pricey, but so worth it. We probably never would have gone here except some considerate wedding guests went in together and got us a gift certificate. The waitress was SO nice, despite us being completely out of our element. This place is super fancy, and we are more of the bar and grill-type frequenters. Also, when we called and made a reservation, we told them we were on our honeymoon. They brought us a mini-appetizer on the house and congratulated us, which was a nice touch.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	zBwFqmw7OA4xm2PHUlFUDg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

So buttery rich you didn't want it to end! and of course there was dessert, creme brulee and John brought the bday boy some perfect sorbet! ugh!!! Seriously where do they get off??  Then to top it off they had the nerve to provide amazing service as well! John, I assume the manager, was great very attentive, fun, well humored!!

wypIQMOOnXSH4uU8cSESkA	5	2013-09-12 00:00:00	Hands down the best steak I've ever had. \n\nWhat an absolutely memorable experience from start to finish and a complete slam dunk on the three foodie tenets: food, service and ambiance. \n\nOur waiter, Frank, was friendly, hilarious and beyond helpful. His recommendations just simply rocked. The ambiance was spacious, open, modern and comfortably cozy - the dining area is huge and perfect for large group dinners. We stayed at the Palazzo so it was a convenient location to head to since its in the heart of the Venetian. \n\nNow here are the juicy deets on the food: \n1. Tomato Bisque soup with a dollop of cream: OH MY GOODNESS. So creamy and absolutely delicious\n2. Filet of beef medallions: The juiciest and most tender pieces of beef you'll ever find topped with mushrooms & bread crumbs, apple bacon, parmesan cheese and a special home made sauce *insert tears of happiness* \n3. Delmonico's prime hamburger: Oh my oh my. Served on a toasted brioche roll with cheddar cheese and bacon and accompanied by a bed of fries... this burger is unlike your average joe one. It's hearty, juicy, tender and foodgasmic. Do yourselves a major favor and include this as one of your entrees. \n4. Emeril's banana cream pie: After all of the steak and appetizers, my stomach was literally about to burst from fullness. However, at the taste of this pie, I was somehow able to stretch my pants to new heights and devour the whole pie. Thank goodness my bf and I ordered our own desserts because he just wouldn't have gotten any otherwise. \n5. The pinot noir I ordered was the perfect complement to all of the above, taking my palette to new extremes. Unfortunately, I can't remember the name, but I do remember that it was from Sonoma and I ordered it by the glass. \n\nWe also had the lobster bisque and the BBQ shrimp as appetizers. While they were phenomenal as well, they were a mere 5 stars in comparison to the 6-7 star dishes above. So basically, you can't lose by ordering anything at Delmonico's. \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!	7	3	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	mS-4O56dx6wt5fWxbbx-LQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We ordered the wedge salad and lobster bisque as our appetizers. Both were delicious and we were really impressed with the bisque.\n\nWe ordered the bone in rib eye and lobster stuffed with crab. There was nothing impressive about these two dishes. My husband liked to lobster but said the crab mixture had too much mayo (?). My ribeye cut was too fatty and didn't need the butter. I felt like I was eating a rib eye from Paula Dean's kitchen. \n\nFor, dessert, we ordered the macadamia nut bread pudding. Uh, meh, nothing spectacular.  The italian espresso was very good.\n\nI'm giving this place four stars because the service was really good and I believe the dishes we choose weren't bad, they just didn't please our taste buds.

The service was amazing as you would expect for this type of restaurant. I made a note on our OpenTable reservation that it was for his birthday and every single person wished him a happy birthday, by name, as well as giving us lots of free goodies! \n\nWe pretty much ordered everything our hearts desired (which was a lot more than our stomachs could hold):\n\nTruffle and parmesan potato chips - sounds simple enough, but I definitely recommend. Nice, simple appetizer that happens to be divine.\n\nRun of the mill mixed greens and lobster bisque. The lobster bisque is a must try! Best I've had!\n\nFilet mignon and bone-in ribeye for our main course. Very flavorful, cooked to perfection. The bone-in ribeye is HUGE, so bring your appetite for this one.\n\nWe had chocolate sorbet on the house and ordered an additional slice of banana cream pie (we were curious why Emeril's name was attached to it). That is the first time I've had banana cream pie and I feel like I could never eat it again unless it came from here. \n\nWonderful experience and will definitely have to make a trip back.	0	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	KDCFoClUwu1Pr1so_5TTjA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

x932oEL3clx0yokhhDlH7w	1	2013-11-12 00:00:00	Ambiance is zilch -- honestly I don't know how the decor could be more plain and completely un-styled.  Sommelier unfamiliar with the wine we picked.  Steak was cooked correctly, but thin (for a premium steakhouse) and presentation was poor -- cooled and congealed greasy sauce/butter.  I am skeptical of the USDA Prime rating for this steak -- it was nowhere near as high quality as other Prime steaks I've had.  Creamed spinach was oddly tough and chewy -- I don't even know how that is possible but it was.\n\nOn the plus side, the lighting is effective and the whisky and bourbon selection is great.\n\nService felt very scripted and impersonal.\n\nI can't believe the reputation this place has.  I guess it is Vegas, and when people pay top dollar they put on their rose tinted glasses and fail to see that the emperor has no clothes.\n\nIf it was not for the price and reputation, i would say it was a decent meal.  But it was so not even in the same ballpark as meals I've had for the same price at El Gaucho, the Metropolitan Grill, Wolfgang's in Manhattan, and steaks in Brazil and Argentina.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	qUPAHTfAocAxo6aBrXiPbA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

It was quite pricey, but it was a very memorable dinner to say the least.  I truly felt special being lead to a private room  in the kitchen of the restaurant to dine with good company!  We had blinds to cover our space from the rest of the restaurant, even had our own music in our own room!  Being able to peer into the kitchen and watch the staff prep and cook while we eat alone already had a super cool factor to it!!!  I highly recommend it for anyone that is willing to splurge on a nice private wine and dinner pairing.\n\nOur chef (Chef Erwin) and sommelier (Dylan) for the night were fantastic and every course/pairing I had was an absolute delight to my tasting palette.  Some of my favorites from the night were the truffle and parmesan chips, pork chops, steak, and dessert (esp the banana cream pie, and chocolate decadence cake, butter cake, and flan!).  I'm sure whoever your chef is for the night won't disappoint.  This chef's table beyond exceeded my expectations and I couldn't be happier to recommend this experience to anyone.  Dooooo it!!!	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	zLiMsSMhcr_lVXdmDy7_NA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
XabIdq6nDdg8NYicLBTZ9A	2	2008-08-25 00:00:00	The boy picked Delmonico's because he loves steak ad I didn't want to leave the hotel. Now, in all honesty, I wasn't my normal foodie self, I wasn't really that hungry, so maybe I'm not giving it a fair review....but....\nWe arrived 5 minutes late for our reservation, and were greeted by the host with a little attitude, but in all fairness, I was in heels hiking miles to get to this place, give me a break! After he made a point of stating the time, and the time our reservation was, we were escorted to our table. The decor almost feels cave-like, which worked for a steakhouse. The place was packed and it took a little longer than fine dining protocol allows for to get our menus. Our waitress was a sweetheart and made suggestions for us, although she seemed swamped with tables. \nI decided on the lobster bisque and the petite fillet Mignon. The lobster bisque was ok, nothing special, which was sad, since I watch the food network 24/7 and love Emeril, (I expected more from his restaurant). My fillet was a little overcooked for medium rare, and really had nothing special about it. No flavor to set it apart from a fillet I'd get from Costco and make on the grill myself. The boy loved his steak, so I guess the meal was a success, but having been to N9NE, I wouldn't come back here. The prices are high, and the food is just good, not world changing like Vegas fine dining should be.	3	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	8XmIIleAnuhOwB7EJjSaGQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
XBPsr3PGgdQIwUXTxeeHPQ	4	2007-11-12 00:00:00	Really good service and food.  I loved the mozzarella bruschetta we had, it had amazingly good flavor (garlic, shallots, tomatoes) drizzled lightly with either a balsamic reduction or really well aged balsamic vinegar, and on a toast point that wasn't hard and crusty.  Their soup special was pumpkin soup, creamy and seasoned nicely.  My husband I both got salads, I got the spinach salad with bacon and he got the fresh baby greens.  Both were good.  Too bad we came to a steakhouse and only ordered vegetarian dishes, we were just overwhelmed by all the heavy food we've been eating since we arrived in Vegas.  Next time, we'll try their seafood or meat dishes.  We finished off our meal with dessert, the fruit cobbler topped with caramel ice cream was YUM!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	6jJaCmz5-mm1KpMhK4XsGA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I loved how the waiters and the chef that night wanted to listen to people's opinions of the dishes. Right when we arrived, they allowed us to sample an appetizer on the house, and the waiters asked for our opinion about it. It was a flaky chicken salad puff of some sort, and it was delicious! The side dishes I had were the mushrooms and asparagus. Scrumptious! As for the steak....SUPERB!  I had the steak in the bone (forgot the real name), and it was really good! My goodness! The environment is very dim but elegant. Fancy dining, for sure. I will always love that the waiters are wearing suits and always ask your opinion about every dish you try! They were even nice enough to give me a cute little chocolate dessert for my birthday for free! I love Delmonicos!	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Tk_FWXueutKii3f9yJFsdw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Two amazing restaurants, two different styles, but personal preference would land me at Delmonico.\n\nW-O-W. Flavorful steak, HUGE portions, it was really, really hard to hide my semi while I was tearing into the meat. Great side dishes like garlic mushrooms, amazing peach cobbler for dessert, great red wine, attentive wait staff... pure bliss. Better than wearing my clown suit at an elementary school. Way better.

XH1KC-kXr0uKKsH07jr6sw	3	2016-07-19 00:00:00	Pescatarian review:\n\nWe came here because we had a hotel credit to use from the Palazzo so it was our fancy meal of the trip. \n\nI am a pescatarian so I had:\n-Chardonnay\n-Complimentary bread: lovely\n-Halibut with chantarelle mushrooms and black-rice risotto: the chanterelles were yummy. The halibut was well cooked and delicate. The black-rice risotto was different but overall, this dish was not real exciting.\n\nMy family's dishes: \n-Chateaubriand: at $120 for 2 people, this was probably the best deal since it's the only one that came with sides of asparagus and mashed potatoes.\n-Filet Mignon\n-Rib Eye\n-Broccoli side\n-Baked potato\n\nThey thought the rub was a little too salty and the rib eye meat to not be as high quality. The filet mignon and chateaubriand got a "pretty good" otherwise.\n\nThe service here is very good. I'd say the decor is lacking. In a strip of restaurants in a 5 star hotel, it wasn't very grand and the entrance was easy to miss. It could have felt fancier.\n\nAll in all, an ok first time at an Emeril restaurant.	2	2	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ot3m-jIwFMFFCMG1bkLZgQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Bbq shrimp! just so yummy!!!! The Lobster Bisque was nice and creamy. The steak was the melt in your mouth type of steak. Great flavor and nothing close to being dry. The creme brulee was delicious!

xjQWHq9IPzA9Vz--SVz63A	5	2007-08-09 00:00:00	My boss reccomended Delmonico's to me in a SERIOUS way, so when I had a chance to go to Vegas with some big foodies, I immediately suggested we try it out. We made reservations for 10:00pm on the Friday we were all scheduled to arrive. We were all coming seperately from different airlines and different cities and planned to meet at the airport and head out. I. WAS. PUMPED. Super damn excited. \n\nAnd then my flight was delayed. I hate Southwest-- this is what happens when you try to be cheap but still end up paying $250 to fly for half an hour from LA to Vegas. My flight was delayed and delayed and I started to really worry. I worried in the terminal while I nervously sipped my venti coffee. (I swear I had ordered a tall?) I worried for the TWO HOURS I spent sitting on the plane on the runway, trying with much difficulty to bury my face in Harry Potter 7 while I sat next to a really annoying and "overly affectionate" couple. (Seriously... DON'T DO THAT. WTF!? Have you no decency!?! Where the fuck is your mother!??!)\n\nI landed at 10:00, booked it to the cab line, sprinted through the Venetian in heels, and, sweaty, restless, tired, and uncomfortable with my carry-on bag, met my friends at the bar in Delmonico's at 10:20. My entire excursion from my house in Los Angeles to the restaurant in Vegas took 4 hours. I'm pretty sure I could have driven. I wanted to die.\n\nWas it worth it?\nYES IT WAS.\n\nGrey Goose and tonic: strong enough to keep me from death type of worth it.\nBeer and cheese fondue with pretzel bread: salty-cheesy goodness type of worth it.\nOysters Rockefeller: I don't even like oysters and it was worth it.\nTruffle parmesan potato chips: the light, crispy, addicting type of worth it.\nSalad with fresh fried mozzarella: I want to eat this cheese until I gain 400 pounds and have to be air-lifted out of my house type of worth it.\nDry Grilled Aged Sirlion a la Oscar with Blue Crab: I was so full at this point I could only eat two bites of this and it was STILL worth it.\nThree different attentive waiters: I get a little chill when waiters murmur "Pardon my reach" under their breath like it's a secret type of worth it.\n\nThe menu looked expensive (around $50 for entrees) but our table, for 4 people with a half bottle of wine, cocktails, entrees for each, soups/slads, and appetizers came out to around $400. It was pretty reasonable for the volume and quality of food we ate, but, really now, $400 is spendy. I won a little bit of money over the weekend, so now I can afford to go back. And I will be back!	0	4	2	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Ic__IHJ6KuW2AvBbPliXXQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

They met a few requirement we needed, a late reservation and corkage. Most places in Vegas don't do corkage and he was super attached to the wine that he brought. \n    The service was incredible. They were so attentive and well versed when it came to the menu. Out of the 6 people we had with us 5 were or are in the food industry. The man was an executive chef and the rest are fine dinning servers. Our servers kept them very happy. \n   The man and I shared the Cesar salad for two prepared table side. I had the Fillet Oscar style. It was honestly the best steak I had ever had. They were very generous with the crab and asparagus. The rest of our party dinned on rib eye, pork chop and the day's specials. It was all amazing. We finished off the meal with a banana creme pie. I don't really like banana cream. This was outstanding. Real sliced bananas with fresh creme, my god! \n   When the bill came were pleasantly surprised at how reasonable it was. A little over $500 for 6 people and 3 bottles of wine.  \nI can't wait to go back!	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	GMiMXVIv9y5gpF95WCBZEQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

They are known for steaks. \n\nWe started our meal with the Seafood Tower. The Tower has lobster, shrimp, tuna, oysters, Alaskan king crab. Wow, talk about a carnival in your mouth! The Seafood is fresh and sweet.\n\nI ordered the bone-in ribeye. It was a very large cut! It could have easily been shared. The steak comes a la carte so you have to also order side dishes. The sides are mostly vegetables as options (broccoli, scalloped potatoes, creamed spinach, asparagus, mushrooms). The steak was cooked perfectly and it was perfectly seasoned too. The sides were delicious too.\n\nAt Dessert time, You must try Emeril's signature Banana Cream Pie. It is nice and light. Not sweet, light, just right. It is my most favorite dish at Emeril's restaurants! A must try!\n\nDelmonico's is pricey but delicious!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	KC8H7qTZVPIEnanw9fG43g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I had the\nChateaubriand, and yes, it was good...but the table side presentation was the only GREAT thing about it, the steak itself was nothing i would go back for.

Our husbands steaks were good but nothing to write home about. Servers were attentive but they get a big zero for 1 reason- we told them our fish was dry in a very nice/hushed manor and they still charged us for it.

When has a free steak ever turned me down?\n\nDelmonico was no exception, good food!  I had wanted to try this place before but eating like a king on a pauper's salary just didn't cut it.  Emeril has done a great job with his steakhouse here in Las Vegas.\n\nThe presenters for this IT seminar were smart, they decided to make us go though a big chunk of their product presentation BEFORE letting us start to partake in our steak lunch.  That was smooth guys...make us sweat it out!  But the payoff was pretty good.  Our menu was one created by the folks doing the seminar, it was a nice three-course meal.\n\nWe started off with Delmonico's Organic Baby Mixed Greens Salad - topped with creole spiced croutons, shaved manchego cheese, teardrop tomatoes, shaved red onions, and a sherry vinaigrette.  Excellent salad, light, tart, salty, and the croutons and red onions (I love them raw if they're sliced really thin) gave it some nice crunch.\n\nNext we had the choice of either a steak or salmon.  Seeing as I was in a steakhouse and that I-like-a-the-beef, I naturally went for a steak.  On the menu was a petite ribeye - which was charbroiled USDA prime aged, creole seasoned, and topped with butter.  Got mine in a nice medium rare.  Boy oh boy, was this a winner!  Tender, succulent, cooked right, a nice kick from the creole seasoning, excellent I say.  I usually like a steak sauce with my steak...but alas, I did not need it!  I sopped up every last bit of the beefy goodness.  The side of Country Smashed Potatoes were good too, but you can guarantee I kept my focus on that lil' slice of heavenly ribeye!  It's up there with one of the most tastiest steaks I've had, and this was only a mini-me of the full size!  I took a look at some of the other diners steaks that weren't in on our seminar, and they were huge!  Delmonico definitely puts out a lot of meat for the money.\n\nWe ended the menu with a chocolate tart of some sort, I cannot fully remember it off the top of my head because I really wasted most of my brain power consuming that steak.  But yes, that tart must have been pretty good because I do remember finishing that as well!\n\nQuickly looking at the actual menu, Delmonico is on par with pricing as other steakhouses in the area.  Most steaks are hitting the $40-50 range, sides are around $9 a pop, with desserts around $10.  Not cheap so if you're going here make sure it's a special occasion!  But then again, if you are rich I guess everyday would be a special occasion.	1	2	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
xtMFuvlwqGgQ07Y-shAjzQ	4	2009-03-25 00:00:00	Went here for our first dinner as a married couple in Vegas, and we dropped some decent dough, but it was worth every penny.\n\nStarted with the calamari which was unbelivable.  Cooked perfectly and the olive salad on top was fantastic.\n\nBest Filet Mignon I have ever eaten, hands down.\n\nI also highly recommend springing for the garlic mushrooms.  It is a bunch of exotic mushrooms seasoned and sauteed perfectly.  We also had the country smashed potatoes and the creamed spinach, both delicious.\n\nFinished off with creme brulee which was decent.  I expected better for the dessert after the fabulous meal.\n\nDon't get me wrong, dinner was NOT cheap, but it was fantastic.  The whole dining experience was great.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	zsIvunC1NALQe7zgpbrxcQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
xuA2ieGJ9ulawxl7KHM8kQ	5	2010-08-18 00:00:00	First, I want to say that it was totally cool to be able to make a reservation here via Open Table though Yelp. It was easy and I didn't have to sign up for any additional stuff. Big ups right there. I even received a confirmation email the night before (although I had already called to confirm the reservation).\n\nOur server name? Michael Jackson. He didn't moonwalk for us but it was probably the best single display of customer service in a restaurant that I've ever had the pleasure of dining in. He was engaging, attentive, and even dropping "kama'aina" and a few other Pidgin words upon realizing all of us were sitting there in our Sig Zane's (http://www.yelp.com/biz/sig-zane-designs-hilo).\n\nWe actually started with a small sampler platter that was given to us on the house because we were with our friends who lived there. I guess they like to encourage Las Vegas locals to come down more often. It was juicy because of the veggies on top, but the meat was a bit crisp and even more on the burnt side for me. After that we ordered the Truffle Oil and Parmesan Potato Chips and Emeril's signature cajun New Orleans Barbecue Shrimp appetizers. The potato chips were highly addictive and had a super rich flavor to them. Add the Parmesan and the saltiness was of great compliment. One of the many highlights to the evening was the shrimp appetizer. The large shrimp were wonderfully crafted with just the right amount of spices to encourage their fresh sweetness to linger.\n\nI ordered the special Bone in Rib Eye Steak. It was perfectly cooked to medium. The thing was pretty large and I finished off most of it, but coupled with everything else we ordered, it was a tall task. My good friend ordered the Filet Mignon Medallions and they were spectacularly juicy and flavorful. I actually secretly wished I had ordered that instead.\n\nOurs sides consisted of Potato Gratin, caramelized Seasonal Onions, and Creamed Corn Gratinee. They all were excellent in their own right. My friend described the Potato Gratin as the single best dish of Potato Gratin he has ever had. Myself, I thought that the Seasonal Onions were spectacularly sweet. They blew my mind and I almost loaded up on those alone. The Corn Gratinee was also sweet, but it wasn't as good as the other two. Although, two spectacular sides out of three isn't too shabby.\n\nOverall, it was a great spending time with good friends over an excellent meal in addition to the wonderful service. It was worth every expensive penny I could slam on the credit card. I would easily recommend to anyone the experience. Reservations are highly recommended. One last note, we even got a hand-written thank you postcard less than a week later from Michael. That was really nice.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	fefbZ3J59Ca4WMmLKa-D-Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
xv_OaO7A4Q_svmGpPNA8sQ	5	2012-08-08 00:00:00	I'm a simple dude.  I'm a thrifty dude.  When you combine the two, it's a wonder when I spend $40 on an entire night out.  So it was a significant deal for me to set foot into a place where a plate of food is on par with my average bar tab.  It was a special occasion so I shelved my cheap-skate side for the evening.\n\nThank god I did.\n\nMy wife and I arrived early and had a drink at the bar.  The bartenders were exactly what I look for in one: chill, conversational, intelligent but not lording their smarts over you, and just nice dudes.  Our drinks were great (though I did have to swat at one fruit fly, but that happens).\n\nDinner was unlike anything I'd ever had before.  Here's why:\n- Three servers throughout the course of our evening, and all of them were great\n- I was able to get a black napkin without asking\n- The table was perfectly sized; I didn't feel like I was going to nail someone with an elbow when they were sitting next to me\n- My wife ordered a Cesar salad which we split.  The thing was hand-prepared at our table and it was amazing\n- I ordered duck.  I'd never had duck before and felt this was a perfect opportunity to do so.  I expected a breast or perhaps a thigh--not a half of a duck.  From bite one to cleaning the bones, it was spectacular\n-Everyone at the table completely cleaned their plates (or had the intention of doing so if we didn't run out of time before our show--not for the sake of service, rather solid conversation).  Not one dissatisfied customer\n\nShould I come into a small fortune in the future, I'll certainly come back.  Until then, I'll just have to dream.	3	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	jW2ksV1oL1h_4CPIbPe2lg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
XwnN7pgWitExf-AxFZhWjA	3	2012-02-03 00:00:00	Service - Exceptional 5 stars  Classic high end steak house service, Head waiter assisted by 2 servers for your table.  Fast drinks, table clean-up, staff comes back often to make sure you are OK.\n\nSoups and Apps  5 stars - Our party enjoyed the steak tar-tare and our lobster bisques.  Very good Quality.\n\nSteaks - OK 3 Stars.  The only reason I rated three starts for the review.  If you are a patron of New York steakhouses such as Peter Lugers or S and W,  or excellent national steakhouses such as Shula's, like myself, you may not enjoy the steak cuts.  My New York Strip was fairly tough, and required some heavy cutting considering the $50 price.  If you can't cut a $50med. rare steak with a serrated butter knife, I don't want to eat it.  It probably has some good marbling as it was juicy and moist, but it had some tough fibers that were definitely not meat or bands of marbling.  This may be expected in a ribeye where tendonous material often lines the outer rim of the steak.\n\nOverall, a great dining experience with great service, but 3 stars because of meat cuts.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	y1yC8xi9DHHhuIWVo--2PQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Xx6obtR7ddCmsPMksKV0FA	5	2009-03-31 00:00:00	I'd say it's probably the best steakhouse i ever had!  Though it doesn't come with a view (like most of the nice restaurants in Vegas), but the settings, decorations alone are very nice.  A romantic get-away with very very nice food - from the perfectly seasoned steaks, their special steak sauces, each one of its side dishes, even the bread (the butter! yum!)...\n\nThey have its own wine celler, and their wine list is prob. the best I see in LV.  Been there a couple times and will definitely go back again - when I have a little extra cash... :)	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Goeb2D2E99xss3tMrX--FQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
XxehtN4AAvLxZLMpYxg-Ew	5	2013-03-17 00:00:00	I am a sucker for celebrity chef restaurants. After a poor dining experience at Gordon Ramsey's Pub & Grill, I was a little skeptical to try another one. Delmonico was wonderful and would blow the pants off anything with Gordon Ramsey's name attached.\n\nThe service here was impeccable. We had multiple servers and they all worked as a team. We never had to ask for anything because they were always on top of it.\n\nThe wine list was like a novel! \n\nI ordered the vine-ripened tomato salad with burrata, which was very tasty. For my meal, I had the filet mignon, cooked PERFECTLY medium rare. Overcooked meat does not make me happy, so I was very pleased with how mine came out. I also ordered a baked potato with the works...this potato was HUGE. The waitress even offered to being me more toppings if I ran out.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the banana bread pudding which was delicious and very rich with a scoop of ice cream on top.\n\nI was extremely impressed with Delmonico and would absolutely eat there again!	2	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	uXD0Cc8Md8UTrcU5CHmFIQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I love the bone in ribeye medium rare,  and the fried chips are a must but make sure have them make it with no salt, the cheese flakes they put on top is already salty. Price is high since its inside casino thats the only reason I gave one less than perfect.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	E6C-y4TjrnQOuBmep2Lvig	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

It's not as if it was badly prepared. It's an acquired taste and we were just not big fans of it. Our waiter did notice we didn't finish the dish so he asked if everything was ok. We politely nodded. Surprisingly, they took this item off our bill which was really nice. Service was awesome throughout. My fiancé had the bone-in-rib eye. I had their special - lobster pasta. Both were very good. Overall, I thought the food was decent. The experience was excellent.	0	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	V6VsbyKsbP555ZbqEJ96Lw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

y0r0uP_PWdslBg4TUkTe3A	5	2014-01-10 00:00:00	My boyfriend and I dined at Delmonico for Christmas. We arrived an hour before our scheduled reservation, as we were walking around the hotel, but did not want to wait till 9 o'clock, the time we had our reservation for.  Fortunately, we had no problem getting seated right away.\n\nWe started off with the lobster bisque, which was creamy and full of flavor with large chunks of lobster meat.  For our entree, we each had the bone in rib eye (I had the lobster with my steak) with sautéed garlic mushrooms and country smashed potatoes.  Our steak was cooked to perfection (medium well; pink on the inside, brown on the outside).   Side portions are big enough to share with 2-3 people and even have some left over to take home.  We ended our evening with the duck egg crème brûlée.  My only complaint about the dessert is it was served completely cold.   I've had crème brûlée in many restaurants, and I typically have had it served at room temperature, as the sugar is torched right before it is served.  \n\nI cannot express enough what great customer service wait staff provides at Delmonico!  Staff was incredibly attentive.  They have three servers waiting on you.   They constantly check on you and top your drinks off.  \n\nLike most fab steakhouses, Delmonico is pricey.  With tip, our tab was $300, but it was absolutely worth every penny.  \n\nLike I previously mentioned, our dinner was delicious, but what made our experience even more amazing was the staff.  I have NEVER experienced such great customer service.  \n\nWhen in Vegas and you're craving steak, Delmonico is a MUST!	4	1	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	LgFk4rRbklgJomo64z8dIA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Y0thKKz7R6M-K3aMWL6C5w	5	2012-04-12 00:00:00	Let me start off by saying this is my favorite steakhouse anywhere. Anytime I'm in Vegas, I have to come here.\n\nEmerils BBQ strip are amazing, as is the table side Cesar salad. These are a great way to start your meal. \n\nFor entrees, I have had the rack of lamb, fish specials, etc. All are very good. What keeps me coming back is the bone in rib steak, which is the house specialty. All the beef here is wet and dry aged and amazing. The bone in rib is huge, but you will want to eat every bite and gnaw on the one, although not entirely appropriate at a restaurant of this caliber. Be forewarned that if you order a steak, you get a steak, nothing else. All sides are ala carte and family style. I personally choose to avoid the sides and save the room for the amazing beef. \n\nThe wine selection here is superb. Whether you are looking for a bottle of the finest bordeaux or simply a great by the glass selection, they have it.\n\nFor desserts, you can't go wrong with chef emeril. Pecan pie, peanut butter pie, creme brûlée, and banana creme pie, all amazing. Go for the peanut butter pie, or the banana creme, if they are featured that day.\n\nThe service here is second to none. The staff is friendly and knowledgable, without being stuffy.\n\nWhen in Vegas, check out delmonico steakhouse, I know you'll keep coming back like I do.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Qd4Uu59jEyFQHS96IUb3LQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Y3fIFDjLMg0JB1jNd6w8kg	4	2015-01-07 00:00:00	So this review is going to be two sided since we had mixed experiences. Let me start out by saying this is my 3rd Emeril's restaurant in Vegas. The other two places Fish House and Table 10 are always on the half priced ticket booth so a discount is always possible but given this is a steakhouse in The Venetian no discount. We came here on Dec 30th before our Marroon 5 concert. Securing a reservation over the phone a few days ahead of time was easy. We had wine, appetizers,2 main entrees,2 side dishes and a dessert. \nThe service and customer service here is exceptional. \n\nWe tried the lobster bisque, pasta special appetizer, BBQ shrimp, Cajun Ribeye, Filet Mignon, Gratin potatoes, Mushrooms and the Choc cake. \nMost of the food was delicious but a few fell short like the Ribeye and choc cake. the ribeye was overcooked, not that tender and lacking seasoning. The choc cake was dry and previously frozen. The special pasta appetizer was good but not excellent or anything I would mention ordering again. \nThe filet was delicious and the demi glaze sauce was the highlight. The BBQ shimp were delicious along with the little biscuit that comes with it. The lobster bisque was creamy and seasoned well. My server let me try a sample before deciding on a main appetizer. \n\nWhen asked about our dining experience- we were completely honest with the manager and our server. The main issue was how long we waited for our meal and the $55 ribeye didn't live up to his name. They also forgot to put in one of our appetizers. However, this place gets a four instead of a three because of the amazing customer service we received as a guest. They expedited our food and when we received the bill the ribeye, 2 appetizers, and the cake was taken off our entire bill which to me speaks volumes about how great their customer relations and service is. They have a name to live up to . We had a mixed dining experience but I would probably come back and give this place another chance due to the outstanding customer service. Keep up the good work.	6	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	JuU-5VI0Kl5PG4v6LAkgyg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

All sides were really good, especially the creamed spinach: which actually tasted like spinach in cream sauce -- not the gloop one sometimes get. A special shout out to the sommelier, Dylan, who was engaging and informative and did not blink when we asked for a reasonably priced bottle of wine. The only glitch was we waited a bit longer than expected to have our drink orders taken when we first sat down. Overall a terrific meal.\n\nhttps://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g45963-d422626-r504850640-Delmonico_Steakhouse-Las_Vegas_Nevada.html#	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	YtbCKmQ-eeSC8BP4TFoalA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

If you ever go to Vegas and want to take your wife, fiance, girlfriend, mother or mistress to an unbelievable experience - take them there.\n\nIt was my Anniversary and my wife and I went to the Venetian for our big meal.  When we arrived, the hostess greeted us with a "Happy Anniversary" and sent us into the lounge for a drink on the house.  When our table was ready, they brought us into the dining room - where I see Tom Brady and Giselle Bunchen.  I nod to Tom, and he shoots me with his finger gun.  It was great!!  So we sit down, I am glowing - I learn that we have the best service ever coming our way. Our bus boy and two waiters were waiting for us with a free little sample appetizer for our Anniversary.  The dinner was splendid - it is an Emeril owned restaurant afterall.  We had a very memorable Banana Foster Bread Pudding with Cookies and Cream.  Best dessert ever.  \n\nI highly recommend Delmonico Steakhouse to anyone looking for a nice meal for a special occasion.  Great food, perfect service.

Yb0ZJG-YOGCk2LX-yAXKig	4	2014-08-26 00:00:00	I came here for a bachelor party, and there were some mixed reviews in my crowd.  Most would give this place a 3-star review, but I thought that it deserved a 4-star review.\n\nMost in my crowd thought that the steaks were poorly decorated.  But I was not sure what they expected - steak is steak.  And my filet tasted well enough.  It was cooked well for a medium rare plus, which is hard to do.  So I was impressed enough.\n\nI also shared salmon with someone, but that definitely could have used more salt.  That surprised me considering that this is Emerald's restaurant, where butter and salt is what he *BAM!* loves.\n\nBut I had some sides here that I thought were pretty amazing.  The buttered and gratin'd corn here is delicious.  My friends other hand, felt underwhelmed by their mushrooms and asparagus, which I guess I would have to tend to agree.\n\nThey did have an excellent wine list, however.  I got some bottles of Shafer Relentless for less than double the retail price, which is a great deal considering that I was at an upper-end steakhouse.\n\nLastly, what is noteworthy is that this tends to be a pretty good scene.  So not a bad place for a bachelor's party.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	_UMTGara5YnzRIey3Mva0Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We were looking for a great meal to spend $150-200 on, and we hit it out of the park with this place located in the Venetian shoppes.  \n\nQuick rundown:\n\nFood was absolutely amazing.  My wife had the BBQ Salmon and she is still talking about it days later.  I had the rib-eye and I have to say that it was on par with any other steak I have had, including my fav Maestro's.  \n\nService was what you would expect from an establishment like this, impeccable.  Constant checking in and recommendations that were absolutely perfect!  Was impressed when I asked for a wine recommendation with my steak I was not told the most expensive bottle they had, rather the one that went best with the meal.\n\nOverall if you are in Vegas and looking for a classy and elegant dinner that will cost you, give this place a try.  I don't believe you will be disappointed.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	VcfdaSTcpueWqqMwCG0Ofw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
YEkTPnVbolqLwHWCgz_jtA	5	2013-07-15 00:00:00	One of the BEST steak houses in Vegas, no need to go anywhere else.\n\nI am the biggest mastros fan in Los Angeles, and in Las Vegas.  If you feel like the special rub, cooked to perfection steak... this is the place.  \nMy filet was cooked to perfection.  It would come off the fork and knife like butter.\nThe juices running down the plate, the char on the steak glowing in my face. \n\nFor fans of rib eye, this is the place (get the bone in) I know you may not want to do the work, but its fantastic.  For the filet eaters like me, this is the place.\n\nThe tableside caesar was perfect.  The dressing was spot on, with anchovies (if requested) just the right amount of cheese, and other ingredients.  Its a do it.\n\nI stayed away from the potatoes, but had the creamed corn and spinach and good grief, the night kept getting better and better.\n\nThe gran finale, was the biggest piece of banana cream pie I have ever had.\nThis is no ordinary banana cream pie.  This is over 5 layers of pure banana pieces baked with the best crust and cream you have ever had in your life.\n\nEven if you decide to dine somewhere else (which I disagree with) go for the dessert.\nYou will leave Las Vegas with a smile on your face, ready to gamble and hit the night  on the town.	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	4oOTe6v2RGea2Q1xQHe5dw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
YewX3uDAVnz5-7xtNZTrCg	5	2016-07-16 00:00:00	Overall: A great place for steaks and a nice place to take someone special. \n\nFood: We had the king crab legs as a starter. It was OK. The crab legs were cut in half for you so it's easy to eat. The crabs were not as sweet this time. If seafood is your main course I would recommend Aquanox. \n\nWe had the wagyu ribeye for our main. It came with roasted grape tomatoes and maitake mushrooms. The ribeye was delicious. Very high fat content so I would recommend cooking it medium. It helps the fat meld with the meat. \n\nFor dessert we had the duck egg creme brûlée. It was decadent and not too sweet. \n\nSince it was a special birthday. The birthday girl received a complimentary mango sherbet with a lit candle and happy birthday written in chocolate. \n\nService: The service was good. Mark, Tyke, and Dan took care of us while we were there. Dan also wished the birthday girl happy 21st. While it was her ninth 21st birthday. =)	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	UeLioCORLzFYgWZxbIF4_g	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
YhruDiHr4swTg4XqM9JzFA	4	2008-09-29 00:00:00	We were in town for our 1 year wedding anniversary and wanted to eat somewhere nice before seeing Phantom of the Opera so my wife made reservations here.  The service was excellent and the food was good.  I was a little under the weather that day (allergies!) so I couldn't taste my food as well as I could have.  But for being sick, it still was very good.  My wife said the wine list was overwhelming so our hostess suggested a nice cab from Napa (I forget the name).  We had a relatively quiet meal; not too loud compared to other steakhouses I've frequented.  We will have a go at that place again next time we are in Vegas; hopefully I won't be sick so I can enjoy my meal!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	p-BFBczmPrUTLUKYaBaRNg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
ylsEFfWqR5i7CIbFIUAS-g	3	2008-03-27 00:00:00	where to start....\nHad a party of 4. Started with the Lobster Bisque soup, was a little too salty, but was tasted pretty good. With the main meal it took a while to get and when we got it, the steak that i had ordered ~medium~ was more like extra rare still kicking, and after taking the first bite out of it, it was already luke warm. After telling the waiter about the steak he took it and brought it back, medium rare, still bloody. I didn't think it was possible to mess up on a steak twice in a row, but oh well. The side dish's were asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes, spinach, and garlic mushroom. Just like the steak it got cold too fast, as well as the side dish's, however the garlic mashed potatoes, and the mushrooms were good while they were warm. The spinach would have tasted better if it had come from a can and the asparagus was nothing special, just expensive asparagus!\n\nOverall:\nThe food needs to be served on hot plates!\nThe service was awesome, and that was probably the best quality of the restaurant.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	HE5z8zDbHFqn_WwqTErE3Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
yMOvk-CdvBvZ589ZQbKs5w	4	2011-07-16 00:00:00	Huge portions of meat, satisfying sides and about 4 servers who tend to your every need.  Great!\n\nSure the bill was a bit much, but I think that in addition to paying for the Emeril name, you are paying for the stellar service.  Once in a while - this works for me!  A man pushing in my chair, another refilling my water and another taking the cover off my plate - wow.\n\nWe had an array of dishes:  the bone in steak, pork chops, mashed potatoes, creamed spinach.  The sides look small, but they fill you up and you can share them family style.  Funny, my mom got seared scallops which was a small plate, but they were so delicious!  We had these large plates of meat and we were picking off her dish.  LOL.  Everything was great,  I wasn't expecting something amazing, but we did feel full and like we got a good meal.  \n\nThe dessert was just okay.  We got the bread pudding and coffee. It is good to go to Vegas and try new places are there are so many quality restaurants.  Def glad I went!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	_oEWe8fnyAif0sBYrju-Lw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Yn0XJp6Mebk0V5FfJ8sM2w	5	2010-12-28 00:00:00	I have traveled all over the world tasting the best foods offered in Paris, Rome, New Zealand, Figi, etc and Delmonico's in Las Vegas remains my favorite restaurant.  The bone-in-ribeye is the best I've ever had -- even better than Mastro's in Beverly Hills and Thousand Oaks.  The service is unbelievable (three designated servers per table) and everything we've ever eaten here has been perfect.  My sister came here after eloping 10 years ago in Vegas.  My husband and I came here 7 years ago after eloping (yeah, my family seems to like eloping in Vegas :)) and we've flown here several times since for the sole purpose of a great meal.  If you're in Vegas, I recommend this restaurant above all others.  But be prepared to spend $100-$150/pp.  I haven't been here in over a year but am going tonight.  I wanted to post this review in advance for the past five times I've been here just in case it's not as great.  Either way, I'll post another review after our most recent dinner tonight.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	32TyI3dnVMWVE9mf4xvkFA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

yNNyq2ahGbkv7hDPpQPMLg	4	2007-08-27 00:00:00	I went in with high expectations.  \nThe service was what I had expected, they were very attentive and were on top of our needs throughout our meal.  Our waiters were great!  We sat down, water was brought over very quickly, as did the little "wonton" topped with kalamata olives and proscuitto thing.  I wasn't very impressed by it, I guzzled my water.  By the time I looked up again, my water had been refilled.  WOW!  The waiter brought our bread and explained the menu.  Then she let us be to ponder upon her words.  I chose the scallops with creamed corn sauce.  They scallops were cooked perfectly and the corn chower had lobster in it!  It was 7 minutes in HEAVEN!  The mister and I both opted for steak.  He has the filet mignon and I had the bone-in NY strip.  We decided to share a twice baked potato with cheese and bacon.  His filet was just a filet.  My NY was HUGE!  If I had known it was going to be so large, I would have gotten a filet too.  I was only able to eat half of mine and was not able to have any potato.  The mister finished his steak and all the potato plus his bread which I didn't touch.  The steaks were cooked med-rare perfectly and seasoned.  I could have done without any seasoning on it but hey, that's how they came.  It wasn't ovewhemling in spices but enough that I didn't need any sauces besides the delicious butter just melting so erotically on the plate.  I was stuffed full of steak but I needed to satiate my sweet tooth.  We shared a pecan pie which came with a mound of ice cream.  The crust was absolutely fantastic and the pecans were not burnt.  We had no wine because we were just too dehydrated from the heat, water was all we needed.  I think the mister was slightly disappointed that his filet mignon wasn't as tender as the kobe steaks he is used to.  OH WELL!  I enjoyed my steak and I enjoyed being tended to like a princess.  I had a great night, it would have been better if the darn tables weren't' so close together.  I would have given it 5 stars, I just didn't like being able to hear what the people next to me were whispering about.  The prices were fairly reasonable for Vegas, we've spent double at Yamashiro's and Redondo Beach pier, plenty of times.\n\nDon't let the dress code fool you too much.  There were so many people in there wearing jeans and shorts, I felt a bit over dressed in a cocktail dress and he was wearing a dress shirt and slacks.  The restaurant looked semi-formal, the people there were looking mighty touristy so the ambiance was slightly off.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	eKBvck8VK6KPAHZ_kS1dPA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Yp7g478qP1puRw4eBvS5mg	4	2016-07-17 00:00:00	I had such high expectations for Delmonico's because I love Emeril and because of him my culinary skills are on point but sadly I couldn't give this restaurant the 5 stars I wanted too. The staff was extremely friendly and nice. They gave excellect table service and I didn't have to ask for anything. \n\nWe started our meal with some drinks. I ordered the Brooklyn Yard and my god this gin and juice concoction was so amazing I had two which is alot for this lightweight. We also ordered the BBQ Shrimp and Crispy Fried Oysters and as expected it was heavenly and I savored every bite. \n\nFor dinner I ordered off the Summer Trio menu and chose the New Orleans Gumbo, the Sirloin Strip Steak with Asparagus and the Caramel Butter Cake with Vanilla Cream. The gumbo was just alright. It was good but I felt the roux was too rich and over powered the other ingredients. Although this made me sad I can honestly say I make a kick ass gumbo that taste better but I owe that in part to the many episodes of Emeril Live I've watched, lol. The Sirloin Strip Steak was cooked perfectly but it was lacking in flavor. It tasted like plain meat, no BAM and it was definitely not kicked up a notch. But the Caramel Butter Cake with Vanilla Cream made up for the steak. It was everything a butter cake is suppose to be, buttery, fluffy and just delicious goodness. Because I am a heifer I ordered the Banana Cream Pie too as this is a signature dessert of Delmonico's and the server sweared it was the best dessert on the menu. He lied, lol. It was good but the Caramel Butter Cake was much better. \n\nAlthough I didn't have a five star experience I will be back to give Delmonico's another try.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	rxgB6RpWhKwcaB0pEFXedA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Asparagus was cooked nicely but bland. Iceberg wedge was good, could easily be shared. Service was perfect. Environment is a little generic and mass market like and a little loud. Large leather Seats are comfy but you really need to be 6ft plus to eat at the table easily. This is the spot for a good ribeye and some yummy creamed corn, hands down.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	NC7PyQM8TAIx5n_xUFMlZQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

YR6ZsRSGaLiokAS6Xbn3FQ	3	2010-07-03 00:00:00	Maybe it's the media hyped downturned economy or maybe D's was having a bad Friday night but......this isn't the same Delmonico's I've experienced for many years prior (pre-yelp and post-yelp).  \n\n12 people again dined as we do every year at Delmonico's around the same time of the year and everyone I think felt it was not entirely the same restaurant.   \n\nService: Great service as always but noticeably reduced in staff size, not as sharp (forgot my Voss that I ordered with my meal - $20 water you better remember it)\n\nAmbiance: Not a lot of people in the restaurant for a prime hour on a Friday night.  Everyone seemed a little sullen. \n\nWine: Malbec recommended by Sommelier... not good, expensive, tasting notes didn't match the true flavor... the server had to notice nobody drinking it.\n\nFood: \nTruffled Chips:  They were good, truffle oil evident and tastey\nAmuse Bouche:  Flank Steak + peanut oil, a little overcooked, free\nWedge:  Watery blue cheese dressing, salty... had better\nLobster Bisque Soup:  Fishy, thick, sub-par \nBone In Ribeye:  Didn't taste anything like the previous years, possible downgraded steaks?  No earthy taste to the palate, thinner chop than normal.  Foie Gras served over steak made the steak better and could of eaten the FG by itself.  \nFilet:  good, again tasted downgraded, maybe Choice +\nOscar side:  good and very tastey\nLobster:  not recommended by waiter but it was good, actually the better of the entrees....strange right?\nDesserts (we eat a lot of this)  Birthday cake.... the fudge frosting was good but the cake sucked\nBlueberry Cobbler:  awesome!!  this is always good\nBanana Cream Pie:  ehh....only half eaten\nKey Lime Tart:  overly sugary and made my teeth hurt, it had a strange sugar taste...didn't remind me of key lime anything... sent back.\n\nLast 4-5 years I gave 5 stars and would of given 6 if possible... this year was a 3, nothing memorable but an expensive bill.  I hope this economy turns around or what ever it is and I can enjoy my Delmonicos next year at what I've known it to be.	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ZGM-hsejhwGQKnROvcBBCw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
YRCoTUj1LbYQSH2xNgWvVQ	4	2009-04-04 00:00:00	We went here on our one date night of our vacation to Vegas. It was everything we could have wished for and more. \n\nWe had the BBQ Shrimp as an appetizer, shared a salad, he had the rib eye steak and I the Filet Mignon. both of the steaks melted in our mouths. I have never had a steak do that, and I have had a lot of steaks in my time. We had the Country Smashed Potatoes and steamed asparagus as sides. The Steamed asparagus was nothing new, but the potatoes... oh my, they were good. they were like au gratin potatoes with mozzarella cheese. yummo. \n\nBy the time we were done with all of that, sadly, we did not have room for dessert, but that didn't leave us leaving unhappy... it was quite a lovely experience.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	w8aqRwrvDm95V788GPdcDQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
YrLt9zTnbRBzWE-lLtEVGg	3	2008-01-07 00:00:00	Intro:\nAs is the case with most (if not all) steakhouses, don't fuss with too many appetizers.  Go straight for the beef.\n\nFood:\nChateaubriand, carved tableside with seasonal vegetables - it was hearty, it was tasty.  Very simple presentation - there is nothing between you and the food.\n\nSauteed Garlic Mushrooms - The sauce left a funny, stingy, slighty charred aftertaste.  Not a fan.\n\nWine List:  Seriously lacking.  What's this of not having ANY Chateauneuf Du Pape?\n\nAmbiance:\nElegant, modern, simple, and warm.  I wouldn't mind living in this place.\n\nService:\nHe did his best, but it was quite apparent that he was tired.  The poor guy.  When asked for a suggestion on a Red, he immediately suggested that there was a sommelier onsite.  C'mon buddy, you gotta try just a little, even if it is bulldoohicky! \n\nOverall:\nBe warned - you're paying for the ambiance and the Emeril name.  The food was delicious, but really not uberrifically succulent and extraordinary and memorable and, and....need I go on.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	0f8T72An8ItaYLV7RLVP5A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

The flavor, how it was grilled a perfect medium! You have to try your steak with their red wine reduction! The wife wanted salmon with lobster sauce which they don't offer. Did they say sorry we don't have lobster sauce? NO! They said we will be happy to make you a creamy lobster sauce and she said it was the best she had ever eaten. Now coming from my wife, that's saying something! She is the pickiest eater in the world! And salmon is a tricky fish to grill because it dries out fast and it was juicy and moist as hell! (I had to try a bite) and they used huge chunks of main lobster in the sauce! AT NO EXTRA CHARGE!!!!!!\n\nThe garlic mash (or as they call it, smashed) potato was good and the BBQ shrimp app was really good also. Bottom line, you would be a fool not to try this place out. It was well worth the $145 we spent there!!!!!	5	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	SUXFriiQFQ0Gb4xAo_ENmA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

We had a champagne toast, the chef sent out complimentary bisque as a wedding gift and sorbet after the meal. My husband ordered the Filet Mignon and I ordered the pecan encrusted chicken breast.  We splurged (I rarely order dessert) and shared a piece of chocolate cake.  Everyone was pleasant but with an air of regal you would expect in an upscale restaurant.\nThe only complaint was the table next to us having a serious religious conversation during what should have been a pleasureable friday evening.

It was extremely tasty and was a nice big cut. The service was excellent. The caesar salad which was created table-side was fun to watch and tasted incredible. It would have been nice if they gave us a little bit more time between the salad and when our steaks came out.

yVKixGwfxhTsnev6eOV3pQ	4	2007-11-20 00:00:00	I am going to preface this review by saying that we were given free desserts and a special appetizer from the chef. This was due to my sister knowing the general manager as she was a Vegas concierge for many years. That being said, I thought the meal experience was outstanding.\n\nWe were celebrating an anniversary and there were seven of us including a 7 year old. The waiter brought the aforementioned free appetizer, a steak and blue cheese  croquette and foie grae with cherry compote. Not bad. I started with the baby greens with fried mozzarella. The lettuce was decent, the mozzarella cold and disappointing. \n\nI asked a waiter, not ours, what she recommends and she said easily the Rib Eye in Bone. It saved the meal. As juicy as any steak I've ever had, and spiced to perfection with a dollop of butter melting on top. My wife enjoyed the 2 pound lobster and had started with the Lobster Bisque which she also devoured. The sides were OK. I had the Twice Baked potato with bacon and cheese, but also sampled the french fries, which they specially made for the 7 year old, and they were quite good.\n\nDessert, since it was free, was a virtual sampler platter. The pecan pie was excellent. The bread pudding was disapponting - I've never tried it with cubed up bread with sauce on top and not enough to reach the bottom and served with Oreo ice cream and chocolate Magic Shell. I sampled three flavors of ice cream and gelato and disliked them all, they tasted like ice milk.\n\nThe service was impeccable. Never a want. And the price was not bad, $325 for 7 people but if I included the freebies then it would have touched $400. Bottom line is I'd go back if staying at the Venetian but would try others if not.	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	od3ggjWiZuVqDo_RYb_SVA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I mean its America and we are known for large portions\n\nif I lived in Las Vegas, then it would be okay cuz you could just take it home, but com'on most eaters are prolly out of towners...\n\nanyway, all I remember is the really great steak! \nIf I wanted top-notch steak in vegas, this is probably were I'd be!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ZmEVWKz1IHk-cCbPb27xlw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Therefore, it was a logical imperative that we check out Delmonico Steakhouse and its vaunted whiskey collection.  We got there around 9:30 on a Thursday night and the place was largely empty as the restaurant was nearing the end of its service for the night.  As a side mission, we wanted to also check out the much-mentioned "secret" menu of whiskey-based cocktails created and crafted by Delmonico's lead barman, Max Solano.  Max possesses encyclopedic knowledge of whiskey and is personable and passionate about what he does and if he isn't busy, is very willing to impart some of his knowledge discussing the finer points of whiskey and his whiskey program.  As the curator of Delmonico's whiskey collection, he's assembled the most comprehensive lineup of whiskeys I've ever seen to include hundreds of ultra high quality, hard to find, or never heard of before brands from around the world.  As a personal aside, did they have Pappy Van Winkle?  Yes, of course,...the ENTIRE frickin' Pappy product line and it was on the shelf, not out of stock like so many other places that have it listed on their menu!  I was so tempted to get the Pappy whiskey flight, but on this visit, I was even more intrigued by the secret menu of cocktails.  \n\nDelmonico has a standard (but very intriguing looking) cocktail menu consisting of classics and originals that all of the bartenders can prepare.  However, only Max knows how to craft the secret menu cocktails.  I had the Don's Orders made with Templeton Rye and the Smoked Bluff made with Glenmorangie 12 yr. and both were complex, boozy with subtle sweetness, yet completely balanced.  Simply put, Max's secret menu cocktails were hands down the best treatment of whiskey in a cocktail form that I've yet consumed.  If you love whiskey, then the Delmonico Steakhouse is a must!  The next time for us?  We may even get around to trying the food!	4	2	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
yyfURTvP19UvN5w1lUd5SA	5	2014-04-07 00:00:00	I bring customers for dinner here every year during the ISC trade show for the past 7 years- and it always is the right decision. The drinks are some of the best on the strip, the Lobster Bisque and locally grown tomato salad ( yep a greenhouse in Vegas and the cheese made in house)  is to die for, and everyone that had steak said it was full of flavor and cooked perfectly. I had the Salmon special and it was great as their fish dishes always are.  Until last week I was never a fan of Key Lime pie- but when we got several desserts for the table the Key Lime pie was one of them.. and although I went in with hesitation... it was hands down the best dessert on the table...so the new rule for me is Key Lime Pie- but only at Delmonico!  As all things with the Emeril name impeccable service was our experience - even with a trade show crowd and a large private whiskey tasting event. Our water glasses were never less than 2/3 full, a server was always there for another drink or any issue. The pace of our meal was first rate. I'll be back again next year!	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Vf1hqQ-NQOnVPxshYVeW8Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
YzzusEXDZBE34l0IDMCwiA	5	2012-05-08 00:00:00	The first time I went to this restaurant was in 2002, and I remember it like it was yesterday. It is in the top three meals of my life. After almost 10 years I can still remember the flavors of the table-made Caesar salad, the Angel Hair Pasta with Smoky Mushrooms & Tasso, and the perfect Filet Mignon. Joe and I were dating at the time, now married, and we still talk about that dinner, and went to re-live it a couple years ago to be amazed again.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	TdwK9CyzBKRmEs_WJW0Ppw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Both my husband and I were talking about how people that work in this kind of environment in Vegas have become more and more rude and complacent with customers in the past years. Will not go back.

Z1zCBAC2nIgdTnBc25wUYQ	4	2011-11-17 00:00:00	You know the expression about sailors having a woman in every port. Well, on my recent trip to the USA, I had Yelpers in every town to host, entertain and amuse!\n\nVegas Elite Dennis T was my lunch companion when I was in town. Not only was he gracious enough to clear some time in his busy schedule to have lunch with me but I was honoured that he made our meal together his 100th review\n\nDennis gave me a list of tempting options for lunch. I had to watch how much I was going to have for lunch as I had a dinner reservation at Raku that evening for the kaiseki menu but the lobster sliders at Delmonico caught my eye, so that was my choice.\n\nI had a nice time wandering through the Venetian on my way to Delmonico. The size and scale of U.S. buildings in general amaze me but the Venetian is certainly very ornate and I enjoyed looking at the menus while walking down restaurant row on the way to Delmonico\n\nI instantly recognised Dennis from his Yelp picture and like all the Yelpers I've met, conversation flowed like we were old friends. So much so that unusually for Yelpers, we were chatting so much that ordering took awhile as we hadn't look at the menu the first few times that our waiter approached to take our order\n\nThe restaurant is certainly decked out to appeal to the higher end of customer. It was a quiet lunch service when we dined and while it provided a good ambiance for chatting, I perhaps didn't see Delmonico as the busy celebrity chef steakhouse that it is.\n\nI had already decided on my main course of lobster sliders and using my personal rule of taking the opportunity of eating foods that I don't come across often, I paired that with an appetiser of traditional New Orleans gumbo. I'm not in any position to comment on the authenticity of the gumbo but as Emeril Lagasse started his celebrated celebrity chef trail with his first restaurant Emeril's in New Orleans, I'm guessing he can cook a good gumbo. Mine was certainly pungent with a great depth of flavour from a carefully stock. Being Asian, I was also impressed to see that the rice had been cooked well\n\nDennis was pleased with his appetiser of lobster bisque followed by Caesar salad\n\nIt may seem odd to eschew steak at a steakhouse. However, I've always liked the sound of lobster roll but still haven't tried one yet. I saw these lobster sliders as the nearest I could get until I make my trip to the northeast to try a real lobster roll. Well, the sliders were excellent - soft rolls containing morsels of sweet lobster meat mixed with the right amount of mayonnaise and seafood dressing.\n\nDennis however wasn't quite as lucky with his fillet steak, which arrived looking rather lonely on the plate. Dennis decided to order some bearnaise to correct this loneliness but it took a long time to appear and when it did, it seemed a bit watery.\n\nIn an effort to not be too piggy, Dennis and I split the banana cream pie. Well, the combination of banana, pie, whipped cream, caramel and chocolate shavings pleased my palate probably more than my arteries! I don't have a really sweet tooth but I really enjoyed this\n\nDennis was kind enough to give a lift back to my hotel down the Strip, which gave me a good touristy view of the sights\n\nA friendship sealed. A celebrity chef ticked off. Lobster sliders consumed. A most successful lunch rendezvous indeed!	17	6	15	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	OapLWhQI4_Gm32-nYbHmUA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Z2XhriaGHGdgDB9D3YuexQ	5	2011-12-03 00:00:00	One of the best restaurants from Emeril.  A group of us dined here while in Vegas.  I ordered the ahi tuna/salmon tartare as an appetizer.  It was amazing!  The ahi and salmon tasted very fresh.  The fish is divied by a small amount of seaweed salad.  It's served with wonton chips, cucumber/onion "salad", and a trio of wasabi sauces.  For dinner I ordered the ribeye steak.  It was HUGE.  I was expecting small portions since it's the case at most fancy restaurants. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish my steak.  And most hotels in Vegas do not have a fridge or microwave in the room.  So, I couldn't take it with me.  For dessert, the group shared the bread pudding with butter pecan ice cream, chocolate cake, and pecan pie.  And these were not your typical "pecan pie" or "chocolate cake".  They were all delicious and decadent! You have to try them to really understand.  Overall, my dining experience was wonderful.  The service is impeccable and the restaurant has a warm ambiance to it.  Yes, it's pricey, but you are going to a famous chef's restaurant.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	rOfIWyE1NuZwztDTY3qHog	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
z6RWTqn5dZYPSQxx1lL0GA	3	2007-04-23 00:00:00	For me to give this place 3 stars takes complete honesty from me and also shows my disappointment.  I wanted so much to love this place, to crown it, (it wasn't what I thought it was!), to walk out wholly satisfied in the knowledge that I will not have a better steak.  Dining here was supposed to be one of the cornerstones of this Vegas trip, "remember the time we ate at Delmonico's..." type thing.  The 3 stars is my confession to myself, this place was not worth the price.\n\nI'm no lover of Cajun food, or spices or anything, and the only thing I know about Emeril is he says "BAM!" a lot and the character Elzar on Futurama is a direct parody of him.  I've got no urge to try any more of his food though.  We ate here the evening of the Final Four, had an early reservation and was seated promptly in a fairly quiet room.  Good corner location where we could look out at everything around us but not have people walk by us.  The decor was not of any note... \n\nWe started with the cocktail shrimp with crackers... very odd.  I've been eating a lot of shrimp lately, and there was nothing special about these.  The sauce was a bit spicier than others, so decent.  I pushed my girlfriend to try the kobe...  while I stuck with my old standby of NY.  The bread was nothing special as well.\n\nMy sides were pretty average... I enjoyed my girlfriend's fried scallops though.  The vegetables and potatoes are just complements to the meal though.  The kobe steak came all sliced up and ready to go... It wasn't the mind blowing experience with kobe that I hoped it would be.  I could see the disappointment on my gf's face as she chewed on it.  On the plus side, the kobe sirloin meal came with the sides so thats a few bucks saved.  And sadly, thats the plus side of it.  \n\nMy steak was of a fairly average size, maybe an inch thick, bone-in and perhaps 16 ounces.  I ordered it medium... which the waiter confirmed would be pink throughout.  I waver between medium-rare and medium.. usually if a steak is bone-in I go medium.  Unfortunately, my steak was overcooked.  It got to that bastard style known as medium-well.  I kept hoping as I got closer to the bone it would pinken up, but no such luck.  I ate it happily as it was still a good steak, but I just couldn't shake the disappointment.  The seasoning used on it was decent and had some spice to it but no charm to it.  Part way through my meal I attempted to knife-lift a portion for the gf to try, and wound up dropping it on the table cloth leaving a huge outline of meat.  We laughed about it and both expected our waiter to say something, anything about it as he brushed it with the crumb brush.  Sigh, no such warmth here.  Service was efficient and not quite friendly.  I guess high end steakhouses cater to clients that would rather not have their imperfections pointed out.  One look at me would suggest I'm not the typical client, but no joke came from either our waiter or the assistant waiter.  \n\nAfter we perused the desert menu, I settled on the banana cream pie.  This was the best banana cream pie I've ever had.  It was beautifully presented, had fresh bananas, and was not too sweet.  This was the favorite part of the meal for me.  I doubt I'll ever have a better banana cream pite,  but I'll keep looking.\n\nAll in all, a decent meal but not worth the price.  Meal was ~$200 for 2, no drinks, nothing particularly noteworthy.  I doubt I'll ever go back on my own wallet.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	znk9pbzoiaXduZ8REkZn1w	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Z7Vv7Opbph8iB_PHAJjyrA	2	2011-11-07 00:00:00	Disappointing. I was not pleased with my steak, and I was very cordial about it. The person who I told just said "ok" and walked away. I expected someone to come over and listen to my concerns, but no one ever did. They also did not discount or remove it from my check.\n\nThere are far better steakhouses in Las Vegas.	1	1	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	wT1l26v_C6jrU4hjhnqFYQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Z7Z6AMxJ_gMtgl1Wbl1cMw	3	2014-09-11 00:00:00	Previous to this review, I thought of Delmonicos as a 5 Star Place, but there have been some changes that I really dislike. Mostly the bread. They replaced those amazing Parker House rolls with some nasty Navajo Fry Bread, it's nasty, and greasy, and I don't like it.  \n\nOther than the bread f*** up, I like Delmonicos. The chateaubriand for 2 for $100 is a great deal! This is the real reason I come here. It comes with asparagus and garlic smashed potatoes. I add an order of sautéed mushrooms and am in heaven. \n\nThe service and atmosphere are also top quality, but because of the rolls being gone, I am giving this place a 3 star rating until they bring them back.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	y3OmMymE57BiHa03yjaxCQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Z9oBn1SfRQTGyG5I1yd9Ww	2	2013-04-11 00:00:00	tl;dr - You can do much much better.  \n\nI was actually kind of shocked by this place.  I had heard good things, but was disappointed at virtually every turn:\n\nAppearance - the place is falling apart.  tiles falling out of walls, holes in walls, dirty bathrooms, uncomfortable and awkward seating.\n\nService - mediocre.  Had to ask repeatedly for items, waiter disappeared for 20+ minutes at a time.  \n\nFood - decent; worthy of a 3 star, but the rest drags the rating down.  My filet was cooked to order and seasoned well.  When I ask for anchovies for my caesar salad though, I don't mean 'the anchovy paste you use in the dressing is adequate.'  It means I would like actual anchovies.  This isn't rocket surgery, delmonico.\n\nAll in all, anywhere else this would have rated a 3 star experience, but given both the price (in general, and relative to other steakhouses in vegas), and the sheer overabundance of steakhouses per capita in LV, there's no way this should rate highly on anyone's list.   Bad form, Delmonico.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	QLuhEax0OmPrE6EJzY_jmw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
Z9Suypkw_zdglBF94fwtvg	5	2009-05-15 00:00:00	One of the best meals we've ever had.  the staff was very friendly, the prices a bit high but worth it.  We got the chicken, the shrimp pasta and the the petite beef medallions.  The chicken tasted a little gamey to me but the shrimp pasta and the beef medallions were great.  the portions were also reasonable.  We didn't drink or order any appetizers but 3 entrees and the meal was about $150 total.  Not bad for a wonderful meal for 3 ppl.  One of the best meals I've ever had and I've been to a lot of Emeril's places and this is the best by far.  Gotta go.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	apUNf0oFKKzlGbk1Jvg1PQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
za8l-xuX2LFn8odWDb8CXA	3	2013-08-27 00:00:00	We started off with the pork trotter, butternut squash ravioli & bbq shrimp. I loved the ravioli and the shrimp was also really good. That trotter was just so-so. Not worth ordering again in the future. I had to of course order the bone-in ribeye for my entree. It's disappointing to me when a steakhouse doesn't cook a steak the way you had requested... especially a high end one such as this. I ordered medium-rare. It was definitely cooked medium. I don't usually send food back because other people are with me and I'd have to make them wait. I can still enjoy my food if it's not perfect. However, I do make a note of it on my reviews so that the chefs and future customers know. I'm sure this isn't a mistake that they make regularly (At least I hope not!). I also prefer a saltier steak. It could have used more fat too. I like my hypertension and cholesterol... The sides we ordered for the table were all delicious. Mushrooms & creamed corn were probably the best. Creamed spinach and gratin were just okay. I tried some of my friend's chicken. It was pretty good, but the sides it came with were the most impressive. \n\nAs expected from a nice steakhouse such as this, the service was excellent.	1	1	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	_tpzswb4NTS4bniz9aM1nQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Mine was prepared medium/rare oscar style.  The steaks were cooked to perfection.  The service was exceptional.  We have eaten at some of the best steakhouses in the country.  We now have a new standard to measure against.  For years we have used Berns Steakhouse in Tampa as our golden rule.  In terms of overall service, food, and atmosphere Delmonico has risen to the top of the list.  My advice, don't throw away all of your money at the casino; slow down for a moment and enjoy a great dinner at Delmonico.  It is one thing when you leave Vegas that you will not be sorry for.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	11nV2rRRmsnoePyWazVq_A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
zBiEZwq2M95CVtI3fw5KKg	4	2007-06-23 00:00:00	This place is a solid four star restaurant.  The decor was modern and minimalist.  Our server helpful and attentive.  The food was great.  We started off with Emeril's cajun BBQ shrimp.  They were just enough to hold us over, a little overcooked, but seasoned to perfection.  My girlfriend had a fillet of halibut over a sweet potato risotto and I had the 22 oz bone in steak rib eye.  I had a taste of the sweet potato risotto, and I thought it was delicately sweet with an interesting flavor.  The halibut  was, well, halibut.  My steak, on the other hand, was a real treat.  The bone does weigh the steak down a bit, but it was still thick and juicy.  It also came with three dipping sauces, which were tasty, but also masked the flavor of the beef.  I'd say use them sparingly.  Another complaint about the actual bone was that it kept the steak from being cooked evenly, one side was noticeably bloodier than the other.  In all, our dinner came out to about $150.  I think for a hearty meal with clean presentation accompanied by wine, not a bad deal, but not a home run either.	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	CAQv3QQHUasQNtN-HEldAw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

zg2MIN3vFN5anjqHvdr2bQ	4	2007-12-05 00:00:00	The menu offered very comforting, rich Southern influenced dishes for the most part, such as seafood chowder, creamed spinach, beef chili with chive sour cream and fried rock shrimp. I chose the beef chili, which was very good, if a tad bit too salty for my taste. The portions were well-sized. The banana cream pie, drizzled with caramel sauce, was the ultimate in banana cream pies. The nice sized slice was overloaded with banana slices and dense banana cream custard, and it was complemented with a fine tender crust, whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and caramel sauce. mmmmmmm...Definitely the best banana cream pie I've ever had, and I've tried quite a few. I look forward to going back when I visit Las Vegas again and trying all the other delicious looking dishes. and their key lime pie! You just have to try the pies!

ziAOQCWdzbd-up4NAl5JCg	5	2010-02-11 00:00:00	I have been on the lookout for the perfect filet for some time now.  My search has put this place on the top of my list.  After years of waiting I finally  was able to dine at the famed Delmonico Steakhouse in Vegas.  I was promised by steak loving friends that the filet was so perfect you didn't need a knife to cut it.\n\nMy wife and I arrived a bit early so we could check out their bar.  The ambiance while very nice, was not what I had expected.  It was also not very busy which also threw me off a bit.  Anyway, we sat at the bar and I ordered up my usual (Goose martini with 3 blue cheese olives) and my wife ordered a glass of wine.  We chatted up the friendly bar tender, finished our drinks then headed into the main dining area to be seated.\n\nFirst we were given a ginormous wine list that took us 10 minutes to go through and another 10 minutes to decided what we wanted.  We settled on a very reasonably priced bottle and our waiter was not at all pissed that we didn't drop $100's on a bottle.\n\nFirst they bring you a small dinner roll/bread thing that was very unremarkable.  I liked it that they brought you a single roll so I couldn't eat 4 of them and ruin my dinner, but it just wasn't that good so I really didn't want more than one.  Probably for the best though.\n\nFor an appetizer we shared the gulf shrimp cocktail which was excellent.  The shrimp were boiled in some creole stuff which gave them a very nice flavor.  They give you 4 large shrimp which is perfect for sharing although I could have eaten them all myself.  If you like super hot cocktail sauce then be sure to ask for a side of horseradish to heat it up some more.\n\nThen we had the Caesar  salad which is prepared tableside and is a 2 person portion.  While the salad was pretty good, I wouldn't order it again.  They add some spices to it that I just don't think belong in a salad and gave it an odd flavor.\n\nAs per our steakhouse usual, my wife and I split the filet and we both thought it was excellent.  It wasn't perfect, but probably one of the best I have ever had.  It was cooked perfectly, had excellent flavor and the rub they used wasn't too overpowering.  The steak was very tender but not the cut-with-your-fork kind of tender I am looking for.  At 9oz it was a perfect size to split and not feel overly full after our meal.\n\nFor sides we ordered the veggie of the day (broccoli) and the fingerling potatoes.  I guess they were pretty good but I should have ordered a few of their less healthy options like creamed spinach or mashed potatoes.  My wife was in charge of the sides this time but next time I'm ordering something good.\n\nMy wife and I are both suckers for desserts made in house so we had to try their pecan pie.  It was ok but I would try sometime else next time like the cheese cake.  I wasn't a fan of the crust but I was a fan of the size; it wasn't huge and was perfect for 2 people to share.\n\nAfter dinner my wife ordered a decaf coffee and for some reason I had absinthe.  The after dinner drink menu caught my eye because it had like 5 different selections of absinthe which is very unique.  I asked if I could do a sampler of them all but they said no.  Instead, I settled on one and it was very good.  I am not a very experienced absinthe drinker so I really couldn't tell you if it was any better than any other one but it was quite good......and strong.  I still have no idea why the heck I ordered it.\n\nMy entire Delmonico experience was excellent.  Our entire waitstaff crew (there had to be 4 people waiting on us) were fast, friendly and helpful.  The price for the steak was reasonable and comparable to other steakhouses, but everything else was pretty high.  Anyway, I would definitely dine here again and honestly cannot wait to return.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	8959F5stCzJWI_I7dgxurg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Once before Yelp was born, and again on the 4th a few days ago.  I know of what I speak. Delmonico's is the bomb. \n\nTake the time to have a drink at the bar before dinner.  Try a Turbodog Brown Ale made in Louisiana.  They also make the best Lemon Drop Martini I've ever had.  \n\nIt smells great in there like a good steakhouse should.  The dinning room is comfortable yet still classy.  The host and hostess that night were both very nice.  The wait staff work together in harmony.  Very professional, yet still making you feel your a guest and not just another customer.  \n\nMy GF (The Queen of Reseda) and my usual MO is to split a salad, sides, and a big cut of beef.  \n\nThe rolls they bring are like little pillowy clouds.  They kept bringing them so I kept eating them.\n\nPetite Iceberg Lettuce Wedges\nWisconsin Buttermilk Blue Cheese Dressing, Homemade Apple Smoked Bacon and Red Onion.  Loved the Buttermilk Blue Cheese Dressing.  Great!  \n\nBone In Ribeye, Medium Rare\nU.S.D.A. Prime, Dry-aged.\nOur waiter split it for us table side.\nI resisted the temptation to order A1 in a place like this and ordered some of Emeril's Worcestershire Sauce.  Good call Neanderthal man.\nExceptional!\n\nRoasted Maine Lobster Tail\nGrilled Lemon and Clarified Butter.\nAbout 12 oz. to 14 oz.  Expensive but good!\n\nButtered Fresh Asparagus\nHey, this is kinda healthy and green.  Better order some Béarnaise sauce.  There's not too much butter in that right?\n\nCreamed Corn Gratinée\nGet it, it's awesome.\n\nEmeril's Banana Cream Pie\nCaramel Sauce, Chocolate Shavings and Whipped Cream.\nI asked if we could just get a half slice knowing I wasn't going to get much help from the Queen of Reseda.  I was politely told no can do.  Bring it anyway!  It's all you fat boy!\n\nA cup of freshly brewed coffee and that Banana Cream Pie was a very nice way to end what can only be described as a wonderful dinner from start to finish.	3	1	3	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	gJXuy_foQEwYINnlLZxZsw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
zIZyOwRcrEXeKK8BhWHZrQ	4	2013-02-19 00:00:00	I was treated to a lovely birthday dinner here and was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant is a lot bigger than it actually looks.  Walking past it in the Venetian, you wouldn't believe it extends back to a full restaurant.\n\nThe ambiance is elegant, comfortable, but friendly.  The manager came out before our meal to greet us and wish me a happy birthday, which was rather special.  The wine list was over 100 pages long and took us quite some time to decide which bottle to get.\n\nWe had the truffle & parmesan potato chips, which were just okay, and a small charcuterie plate with homemade cheese chips.\nFor our main courses, I ordered the filet mignon.  My date ordered the bone in ribeye with foie gras.  My steak was arguable the best steak I've ever had.  It was perfectly buttery, seared and charred on the outside but tender, moist, juicy, and pink on the inside.  I had a bite of the ribeye with foie gras, which was just savory overload.\nFor dinner, we received a complimentary "Happy Birthday" sorbet with a candle in it.\n\nI had a great experience there and would go back again for the steak.  I only gave 4 stars and not 5 because the other menu items (starters and sides) were very forgettable.  The steak however, was unforgettable. \n\nDate night seal of approval!	1	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Let me tell you, it was worth every penny. \n\nTop items include:\nDelmonico cocktail. It was heaven, but I love gin and grapefruit and it was a perfect mix. \n\nThe truffle chips. Oh my goodness they were so good. \n\nThe steak my husband ordered melted in your mouth. It was perfectly cooked to order and had fantastic taste. \n\nI ordered seared scallops, a special. Totally amazing. \n\nWe went with our servers recommendation on dessert, the flourless chocolate torte. I'm still pining over it. \n\nAbove all, the service was phenomenal. We had a table of 8 and we always had an attentive server ready to answer any questions, provide recommendations that were always spot on, or even help us find a lost card. \n\nGreat spot!	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	MR5HwOyJ-WdTXbQ8wUCrgw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

ZN8I-Pp-RYKPO6cPE1S9AQ	5	2010-04-01 00:00:00	This was my first trip to Vegas...ever.  I know, how can that be after 31 years of age and my love for everything naughty?  Nevertheless, I wanted to have one memorable, fantastic dinner while there.  After consulting with a few friends and reading fellow yelpers reviews we decided on Delmonico Steakhouse at the Venetian.\n\nFirst, I was able to make our reservation online about two months in advance (same time I booked the trip).  It was so easy I would definitely recommend it to ensure you will have a table ready and waiting for you.  Second, because Mr. Vivi and I were killing it at the Blackjack table at the Mandalay...we were about 15 minutes late for our reservation.  I apologized numerous times when we arrived, and to my relief our table was still ours and the host was super friendly and understanding.  Note:  I don't know if this would fly on a busy Fri or Sat night.\n\nTo say the service was excellent could be an understatement.  We had our main server, I think his name was Eric (insert free drinks at the aforementioned Blackjack table so his name could have been Bob) and he couldn't be more helpful, polite and efficient.  We also had two other people who were assisting Eric with the service who were great as well.  Eric helped me pick out a glass of red wine that was delicious and didn't make me feel bad for not being the wine connoisseur everyone and their mom thinks they are.  Our drinks were brought to us very quickly and we were off to the food.  \n\nI had been perusing the menu for awhile and thought we would go with a full four course meal however, I had no idea how fun the tables would be and didn't want too much food to deter my winnings after dinner.  We opted to skip the appetizer (would have loved to have try the crab cakes or at least the Parmesan potato chips) and went straight to the Cesar salad served table side for two.  If you love Cesar salad please do me a favor and run to this place.  They freaking make the entire thing in front of you, dressing included.  When Eric was finished with my plate I could have clapped I was so happy...in fact I think I did. \n\nNext, we went for the petite medallions with a side of asparagus and a twice baked potato.  Can I say I am in heaven??  This is why I could never be a vegetarian.  The meat was cooked to absolute perfection.  So tender it felt like butter in my mouth.  The asparagus and twice baked potato were both good, but I would definitely try something different next time...there is just too much to chose from.  \n\nI knew in advance the bill was going to be somewhat expensive but seriously, it was worth every single penny.  From start to finish the entire experience made me forget I left a table we were up 500 dollars.  "Ah yeah babe," this place is that good and I will be back the next time I visit.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	ZGOmuk7VrSuztsqF7bPAOg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

zoMi_dyBptU9_V70-Zhr1w	5	2008-07-22 00:00:00	I love everything about this steakhouse.  I waited until after our second visit to write a review just to be accurate...our meal was perfect yet again.   As we were celebrating my birthday on our latest visit, the waiter treated us to a lovely, complimentary first course of duck pate.  We then ordered the popular bbq shrimp as an appetizer along with the lobster bisque.  The shrimp dish consisted of 4 very flavorful large prawns and  the bisque was TO DIE FOR.   Now on to the meat... it was cooked to perfection, a red warm center.  Definitely one of best steaks I have ever had, hands down.    As we wrapped up the dinner, the waiter brought out a complimentary dessert of chocolate sorbet over a waffle flat bread.  The service was impeccable.  We literally had three waiters, 1 head, and 2 assistants.  I would absolutely recommend this establishment to anyone interested in a memorable dining experience.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	N9xkt5ow474Q10dEwNoHQg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

ZqMUHOJg9lGOmfqQ7RXj7A	1	2016-10-15 00:00:00	This was supposed to be a very special dinner for 10 for my husband's 50th birthday. Four other couples flew in  from all over to celebrate with us and the first problem is that they seated us at a table for 9. The hostess called that morning and said 9, I corrected her and let her know there were 10 and she said she'd call me back by noon to confirm but I never heard back. Regardless, this Open Table reso said 10 so I didn't worry about it until we all sat down, realized we were one short, and had to get back up and go wait in the bar. \nWhen were seated at a proper table, the appetizers that I'd pre-ordered were sitting out on the table, including fried oysters which had gone ice cold and soggy (very gross). We had to ask for bread long after entrees were served and it was cold, mushy things that looked like they used to be popovers (I thought I'd remembered a wonderful bread service before...?) And so on with the poor service...\nI've eaten here before and service and food were five stars. But the bone-in ribeyes were bland and not well-marbled, the bone-in bacon was 100% bone-in fat (of course bacon is very fatty but there was NO meat to be found at all) and the service was severely lacking in detail and common meal planning skills. I could list all the issues but you get the picture. Very disappointing. The best part of the meal was the fresh oysters in the seafood tower, very fresh and delicious.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	kOll36Me-rM9NsqoDnejKA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
ZrrpGX0dXYO1xDu-Q6hi_w	5	2016-08-22 00:00:00	Delmonico has become our default steakhouse in Las Vegas. We've never had less than exemplary service and amazing food here, for either lunch or dinner. The staff is on-point, with notes made as to our personal preferences as to table location, etc. The waitstaff is friendly, knowledgeable, efficient and reliable. The food is superb. Quality ingredients prepared in quality ways. I definitely recommend the steak tartare as an appetizer. The only "heads-up" I'd give new patrons is that the sides are rather large. Ordering three or four sides with dinner is contra-indicated unless you are with a large group or dining with teenagers.\n\nExcellent bar and bartenders as well. Ask for the whisky menu and just revel in the selection.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AaCUrnB9ma-ZhytPj3Fh1Q	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Arrived 15 minutes early and was promptly greeted and seated in a nice corner section. Had the pan seared foie gras for appetizer. The main was the bone-in ribeye medium on the pink side and went with the Oscar style, jumbo lump crab meat, grilled asparagus and béarnaise. Also had the country smashed potatoes and a must have cream corn gratinee. We shared everything and still had left overs. Service was great and food was on par.

zUg_3X-Hn0M0uiZsBfXSsw	4	2013-05-25 00:00:00	As Vegas steakhouses go, Delmonico is a fine choice. I've been there twice and both times I've had very good meals. With that said, meeting expectations at this high price point is challenging, and particularly on my most recent visit I'm afraid Delmonico should have been even better. This year we had a large company dinner at Delmonico, so I was able to try lots of dishes. \n\nWe started with the BBQ shrimp and the butternut squash ravioli. The shrimp was good but a little overcooked. The squash was on the rich side but really tasty - you couldn't have but so many so it is good that they list it as an appetizer rather than as a pasta main. I loved one or two but a plateful would've been too much.  I also tried the truffle potato chips, which were wonderful but extremely truffley. \n\nThe lobster bisque was textbook, exactly what lobster bisque is supposed to be - rich and creamy with chunks of tender lobster meat. Still I might have preferred my neighbor's heirloom tomato salad, which I tried and thought was one of the highlights of the meal.  I didn't try it but the duck from the smoked duck salad was not well received by another of my colleagues. \n\nFor my entrée I had the Delmonico signature steak - a bone-in ribeye. This is where the meal fell down ever so slightly. The steak was fine but for the premium price it should have been exceptional and it definitely wasn't. My order of medium rare was barely pink at all and was probably served on the dark side of medium, and I thought the meat was surprisingly devoid of flavor. Don't get me wrong - it was a fine steak, but it was average among the steaks I've had in Las Vegas, at all price points. One of my close work friends who has frequented Delmonico for years ordered the same cut at the dinner and he agreed that for his steak too it was an off-night. Of the sides I loved the creamed corn. Next time I'd do the mashed potatoes over the scalloped potatoes, which I found undercooked and under seasoned. The asparagus was also fine but unspectacular. \n\nThe bread pudding was great and the key lime pie (or was it cheesecake?) was nice too, but I'll reserve my sweetest accolades for the banana cream pie. Best bite of the night. One of the best I've had. Wonderful.	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Uwlm6u10dSFvYSpppbehAg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

You'd never know you're in the middle of a noisy casino - it is away from everything.  The atmosphere is quiet and sophisticated without being stuffy.  In fact, our wait staff team was a great combination of being knowledgeable and fun.  The wine list gave us an ample selection and we were not disappointed with our choices.  We treated ourselves to the rib eye steak and fillet meals with fingerling potato side.  It was wonderful - done as requested with amazing taste thanks to the way they prepare it.  We would have loved to try a dessert (the pictures looked wonderful) but were too full despite sharing the potato side dish.  Maybe next time, we'll split an entree, too so we have room for dessert.  Overall, the entire experience was a real treat.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	j_wohllBiw6nDKWE6ByFbA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I should have said its more of a matured restaurant.  The spot is elegant and classy. From the hostess to the waitress, this spot screams fancy.  We had a lovely dinner here during our Vegas trip.   Before dinner we grabbed a few drinks.  They were really solid.  I guess in Vegas I can be a bit more loose.\n\nLocated inside the Venetian, it was actually my second time visiting this hotel.  Its an incredible spot. I love everything about it.  We were seated and given a menu.  After about a few minutes were decided to run with the bone in ribeye.  Boy was I in for a treat, tasty treat.  The meat was super juicy.  The juices flowed through with every bite.  Cooked to perfection, this piece of steak is highly recommended in my books.   To be honest, when it arrived I wasn't sure if I was gonna be able to finish it but after several bites, I kept at it, wanting more.  \n\nOverall this was actually one of my favorite restaurants.  I caught a glimpse of this spot a few years back and had been wanting to give it a try ever since.  Finally I was able to and it was worth it.  The bone in ribeye is definitely my favorite for about 55 bucks.  The filet was solid too I'm told by my counterpart, but no regrets on my end.  We had a lovely time.  Chances of returning are very high.	13	7	12	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	lfX4Ay6lYeWQ2kSdAxJaDg	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

I would belly crawl through glass to have it again. \n\nWell not really, but it would make me consider doing it that's for sure.  Awesome place and the scotch pairing I had with the steak was so damn good.  The experience is well worth the pricing, and it to the point at which after the meal I return back to my hotel room and fell asleep on the couch from being so blissfully full.\n\nThat never happens after a steak, except for the time I came here. \n\nI would highly recommend anyone to go here, and remember DO NOT FORGET THE FOIE GRAS!	3	3	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	agTG39Xuad2batlT3m-y5A	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

My feet were tired from standing up all three days and didn't want to leave the hotel for dinner.  \n\nHad the following:\n*BBQ Shrimp: tasty sauce but the shrimp was OVERCOOKED!!!  Tough chewing.\n*Vine ripened tomato salad with burrata: It says "torn local basil"... Now how corny is that... and me being more &itchy.... it wasn't torn... they were cut as chiffonade.  I wouldn't thought this but really....."torn local basil".. give me a break..  This was what was expected.  Can you really screw up sliced tomatoes, slapped on burrata on top, "torn local basil", red onion, virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar?  My friend's 4 year old daughter can make this dish.\n*Filet Mignon-medium rare: was the toughest filet mignon I EVER HAD!!!  WTF?!?!?  It was cooked correctly, but TOUGH at $50 for 9oz.  The filet I had at Outback was much more tender. \n*Grits w/bacon and white cheddar: If you like steel cut oats, you'll like this, which I do.  Not creamy like most grits.  Has texture.\n*Banana cream pie: OMG... I LOVE banana cream pie, but this was really bad.  The cream was sooo thick it was almost like a dense cake.  It looks impressive because of the layers of banana.  The flavor wasn't there. Safeways' banana cream pie is MUCH BETTER!! \n\nI also had a cocktail and a glass of red wine.  My meal came up to almost $200.  I don't mind paying the price if the food was worth it... IT WAS NOT!!!  \n\nNot coming back here again.\n\n1 star for the waitress who was very attentive\n1 star for the hostess who got me a table quickly	1	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	uiRHKk-dwVgRNJmDGIERHA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Went with a group of friends and we all had 1 thing on our mind.  Steak.  \n\nWe didn't order any alcohol since we were kind of recovering a bit from the night before.  \n\nFor appetizers, I had the tuna and salmon tartare which was good.  Bunch of my friends had lobster bisque which was rich but very good as well.  The rolls came with a small amount of butter on them and would taste great in the bisque, I'm sure.\n\nFor steaks, everyone went with either the New York or Filet.  I had the filet topped with seared foie gras.  The combination of the two was excellent and very flavorful.  I sadly had to leave some foie gras left over because it was too much.  I tried the New York and that was great as well.  \n\nFor sides we had the potatoes au gratin asparagus.  I didn't have any of the sides, but everyone seemed pretty pleased with them.\n\nUnfortunately, no dessert really jumped out at me.  Everyone split the banana cream pie, but I passed on that since I'm not a fan of bananas.\n\nService was great.  It was pretty loud though, so I couldn't really hear 2 of my friends who were across the table.\n\nOverall though, excellent meal.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	Cea45bU6zSRZSer822iobw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

For dinner, I got the filet which was good but not my favorite filet.  The bone in Ribeye which a majority of people got, looked amazing and everyone who had it loved it.  Desserts were great.

The service was spot on, but the food was BLAH. The only Seafood options were Salmon, or Oysters on a half shell.

_hojHl9tq9AJaM49fsimBg	4	2008-04-22 00:00:00	Boyfriend and I came here with two other friends as an early bday celebration!\n\nThe restaurant is right next to the passageway to the Palazzo Hotel and it sits right in front of the Blue Man theater. The ambience was nice except I took off a star for the boring cream colored walls. \n\nThe food was great! I had a filet mignon while the other three all had a bone in ribeye. Ohmigosh...i couldn't believe how big these things were! They were ginormous! Anyway, the sides were yummy! We had the garlic mushrooms, steamed asparagus, baked potatoes, potato chips, and spinach! Geez...i know we couldn't even get to all of them!\n\nTheir famous banana cream pie was delicious! It was a little frozen...I prefer it to be a bit more thawed...but it was still good!\n\nTheir dinner rolls..ok...this is so Filipino but damn..it tasted like hot pan-de-sal! It was so good! Hahaha...seriously. Emeril's gotta be stealing Goldilock's or Valerio's pandesal recipe! \n\n$400 for the 4 of us....it's alright...step outside and play roulette!

_inbJx1g8OwOWhXAmsfNaQ	3	2011-01-27 00:00:00	Just okay.  \n\nI liked my meal.  I had the gumbo soup, a great baked potato with lots of fixings, a sort of chocolate cheesecake dessert that was great.  My husband didn't like his meal.  My husband ordered a $50 steak that was fatty and gristley.  I could tell he was bummed when he poked around at his steak with furrowed eyebrows, cutting off piece after piece of inedible meat.\n\n  I was really hoping to please him since it was his birthday.  I let them know when I made the reservations well in advance that it was his birthday and we didn't get a birthday dessert or anything free like you do at most other restaurants.  They remembered it was his birthday, the hostess (who was pleasant and very friendly) gave him a cheery happy birthday as we were going to be seated.  I really expect a little something special if we are spending our special day at their establishment.\n\n  The waitstaff was prompt and friendly.  They seemed to linger around and dive right in when you need a refill on your drink, or in my case another great martini.  I almost forgot to mention that I loved their martinis.  \n\nWill we return?  Definitely no.  There are way more better restaurants in Vegas.  The atmosphere is a big blah (with the exception of the impressive suits that the friendly waitors wear), the food was just okay/slightly better than average, and the prices higher than they should be for the quality.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	s-L1HJD6z_Mw16HPWdqaDQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
_kls6-37hXO4_7nIaDpixA	4	2009-09-08 00:00:00	Went here for our 1 year wedding anniversary and we were very pleased with our visit with some exceptions...\n\nWe ordered:\n\nAppetizer: Calamari\nI liked it, but it was way too much for 2 people.  I think I could have done it without the olives - I let the husband order this one.  I would have picked something different.  \n\nSalad: It was the special - arugula, figs, and mousse foie gras\nThe husband was a bit iffy, but because I let him pick the appetizer, he couldn't say much.  Holy crap, that was a yummy fricken salad even the husband liked it!!  I would so order that again.\n\nMain Courses:\nhusband - bone-in ribeye. \nme - bone-in new york steak.\nBOTH were yummy!  They were both cooked to order.  The only thing we didn't like about it was the butter that came on top of both of them.  We didn't think it was neccessary.     \n\nSide dish:\nFingerling potatoes with halves garlic.  \nThis was a waste.  We didn't really eat any of them because they were way too salty.  I love me some salt too, but it was just way too much for heart to handle.  We should have asked for something different, but I didn't want to wait.  We did have a show to catch.\n\nThumbs up:\nThey did recognize our anniversary and gave us a complimentary dish before our salad came out.  I forgot what it was, but it consisted of a chip of some sort, with a slice of beef on top.  It tasted it like it had ginger, soy, and some more stuff and also sesame seeds.  It was really good!  I wish we had more or could have swapped it out with the calamari.	2	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	6wcC4Q9vKnhowNCWlr9gYQ	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

_oHutTOnuiUPo58iDYz0Hg	5	2016-11-30 00:00:00	great place to spurge.  heirloom tomato with burrata was fresh and delicious.  Steak (Ribeye) was cooked to perfection and the seasoning gave it a little extra flavor without overpowering.  Make sure to save room for Emeril's signature banana cream pie.  It was amazing and beautiful.  Each bite was perfectly ripe.  The layering of the pie made it picture worthy.  We also had the lobster bisque and the Bronzino which were good but similar to what I have had at other restaurants.  The highlights were really the steak and banana cream pie.\nMy dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives was also spot on.\nService was truly exceptional.  Servers worked as a team that was a well oiled machine.  Impressive to see all plates landing at the same time including at the large tables near us.  Ambiance was modern.  Chairs were so comfortable, you can really get comfy and enjoy the meal.\nTo be honest, some meals in Vegas are not always worth the price tag so I was a little skeptical.  I was so happy that this was not the case here and Delmonico's really delivered.	0	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	AO4Rs8OyhCvW2tE-CKMWyA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw
_tqK-hTclbiY9SagkCZcXw	5	2011-01-20 00:00:00	Phenomenal!  Came back here to celebrate a birthday and everything was what I expected and more.  My requests for a particular table were all handled without any problems.  \n\nI am usually a New York Strip guy, but I was hungry so I opted for the bone in ribeye for the first time here.  Birthday girl had the filet mignon. Sides included smashed potatoes and broccoli. \n\nBone in ribeye: Humongous! Probably 20oz. +  Beautifully crusted, with just the right amount of seasoning. Steak as always, cooked perfectly medium rare, which made for an amazingly juicy and flavorful experience. \n\nFilet Mignon: Now normally I am not a filet person, but I did try a piece or maybe two.  Beautiful crust and to my surprise it also had excellent flavor.  Tender as you would expect from a great cut of Filet Mignon.  However, still not as juicy as my steak was.\n\nService as usual, impeccable.  Insanely large wine list, with almost every wine imaginable.  Complimentary amuse bouche and bread are also delicious.	2	0	0	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	5dg3AJJNhDMonBlwBYg9vw	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

_vfwLwgNheukOCnU42kscA	5	2013-07-18 00:00:00	Steak! My first trip to Vegas was this past summer with a group of friends. We ate here one night and it's the best steak I have every had in my life. I started with the lobster bisque and for dinner had the boneless ribeye medium rare with a bunch of different sides for the table, no room for desert though. Also two of my friends ordered the Caesar Salad which they make table side (for two people).  \n\nLobster bisque... very very tasty and rich. If you don't like rich foods then you should not order this. It also has nice size chunks of lobster in it. \n\nBoneless ribeye, medium rare...Amazing. It was cooked to perfection, just the way medium rare should be. It was well cooked and well seasoned, there's no need to dip it in ketchup or steak sauce. It was a pretty decent size cut of meat too, I can't remember the ounces but I left stuffed. \n\nCaesar salad...I'm not a fan of rabbit food but watching the person make it table side it looked really good. In a matter of about 5-8 minutes he made two servings of what I was told was the best Caesar salad ever,\n\nAt this restaurant, the steak doesn't come with anything, you have to order the sides separately, I think we ordered asparagus, wild sauteed wild mushrooms and twice baked potato. All was cooked to perfection. \n\nThe Service...it was the outstanding. There are three people per table, so you are always attended to and the waiter is well versed in the menu and the drinks. I wasn't too sure what I wanted so I asked him for a recommendation and he asked me a few questions and based on those answers brought a drink out, which was good. I can't remember the name but it was good. I think it had 3 different kinds of liquor in it but it didn't taste like it at all, not overwhelming, good blend, good bartender. \n\nIt is expensive but well worth the money. The food, the service, the atmosphere and best of all since it is Vegas no need to really dress up, my kind of place. Definitely have to go there again when I go back during Christmas.	6	0	1	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw	jWoZu7TvZ6C4Vpy8tgbQEA	1389	--9e1ONYQuAa-CB_Rrw7Tw

Belly up to the counter if you're claustrophobic.   \n\nEverything I've eaten off of the menu has been stellar.  Some reviewers said orange juice was small, but it's fresh-squeezed and delicious (unless you just brushed your teeth).

I had a cheddar cheese and ham omelet with hashbrowns, sourdough toast and mediocre coffee.  The hashbrowns were on the greasy side, but that didn't bother me; it's just that nothing blew me away either.

-hthsJDmmOEieJkqpD32Ug	4	2013-01-06 00:00:00	MBB is one of those places that I really like, but can't really explain why. Maybe it's the fresh jam, the perfectly cooked bacon, the cute old fashioned style of the place or  the fact that you tell yourself it just has to be great if everyone else is willing to wait in the desert for up to an hour-ish to have their hand at some..I dunno. \n\nIt is indeed tasty, and I've yet to try anything that disappoints, but the menu (in my humble o-pinion) doesn't really offer anything extraordinarily fantastic enough to warrant the wait. That said, if ever I drive by the place in the a.m. hours and happen to see that there's no line, I will consider it my lucky day and likely mosey on in.	2	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	GwFA4dfCdDVwuBQp02cIjw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Even at 10:30am on a Friday there is a line out the door for this place. We happily waited the 30 minutes and it was well worth the wait. The husband had the pork chop and eggs served with hash browns and thick hand cut toast. I opted for the breakfast special of the day which was a hot link scramble with fresh jalapenos and cheddar served with a warm tortilla and hash browns. I will go on record as saying this is the best breakfast I have ever had. The eggs were cooked perfectly, the tortilla warm and fresh, the hash browns were crispy (not greasy) on the outside and perfect on the inside. We couldn't resist trying the pancake made from scratch as well. Fluffy and light served with warm maple syrup. YUM!  We didn't have room for all this food but we wanted to make sure we sampled all Matt's had to offer. WOW great food , excellent prices and warm friendly service.

The food is solid to above average even if it is a little pricey for breakfast but not outrageous.  \n\nThe real draw is the location which is next to the downtown farmers market.  So on Saturday you can hit the market while waiting for your table, buy something to strengthen your locavore cred and then eat at Matt's which is a hip reclaimed location.  \n\nThen off to buy some new Steampunk junk..	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	-we54rrlhsan9bZQsunQNg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

DELICIOUS!!!! Seriously, this breakfast was really awesome. I might have gained five pounds from the butter it was all cooked in, but really, who cares. \n\nThe blackberry jam they happened to be serving that day was absolutely phenomenal, and I hate jam, so you know it must have been good. \n\nI don't know if they have a bathroom but it did not appear so. As previously mentioned in probably every review and earlier in my review, this place is reallllly small. \n\nThe service was great. They served our drinks, took our order and served our food quicker than I expected, especially since the place was packed the entire time. \n\nThe only thing that kept this place from being 5 stars was the coffee.

The sign indicated that they are closed on Mondays but we saw people eating inside so we sent a representative to inquire. I should note that the restaurant closes at 2:30pm and we arrived at 2:25. The waitresses were more than happy to serve us even though they were technically not supposed to be open. Score!\n\nI ordered the insider burger (not on the menu) and it was honestly one of the best burgers I have ever had! How is this possible, you ask? First off, the meat is cooked in butter. You heard me right. Butter. Second, the burger is topped with 2 eggs AND bacon. As if this weren't enough to convince you, it comes with a side of homemade chips and a pickle. Love it! I didn't even care that my face was covered in egg yolk.\n\nIf you're more in the mood for breakfast, Matt's has plenty of options. Their breakfast potatoes have the most intense rosemary flavoring, the bacon is thick and tasty and their homemade toast and jam is wonderful. Order anything on the menu and you won't be disappointed. This is a great restaurant with friendly service and awesome food.	2	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	zolJ74a05lmEAbm9KlY7Gg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
0AaIOAKX-jyykVt3HfULdw	2	2010-02-25 00:00:00	So....finally went.....and am graciously giving one more star. But that's about it.\n\nOf COURSE triple D keeps finding places in Arizona to broadcast shows from. Is this a big news flash or something? We should be the "Wide Load" state. Guy F happens to be a lard, so of course he's gonna B-line towards this shrinky-dinked, over-hyped and over-booked lil' nook that serves portions which could very well springboard the next season of "1000 Pound Dad".\n\nThe whole "Reality Food Show Swoops In And Makes Dining Hotspot Out Of Otherwise Run Of The Mill Establishment" is getting really, REALLY old, Phoenix! Get off your arses and find some places on your own instead of waiting for Food Network to whip you into a manufactured frenzy.\n\nI don't see the point of going, WAITING (and yes - it's true - they don't give wait times {get OVER yourselves}), and then being squished in seats and then paying for portions you can't possibly finish. How about more varied ingredients rather than a hunger-relief-in-Africa portion of potatoes on my plate?\n\nNOW I know why some Scottdalers adore and coddle this place:  It makes 'em feel adventurous. What's more edgy than coming to the semi-impoverished Roosevelt district, parking by a seedy motel (where "those" people live), gorging on local bacon and UFO size pancakes, and then safely returning home to the trials of spending the afternoon at Williams-Sonoma? Please.\n\nThe flavors are good, but not unique for breakfast. Pancakes were fluffy, but not better than my Pop's. It seems the hype is in the portions, the TV exposure, and the limited seating. People see a line and wanna go wait in it, for some reason. The food is so plain and the menu so basic that it behooves me to come to this conclusion: there's nothing new here, folks. It's breakfast. It's huge. And I couldn't care less.	8	9	7	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	R0FVMp6Acx0Rl_HRmS1Twg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
0aKKxCYDdc3UoaYctE_EZw	4	2009-08-02 00:00:00	I love Matt's, BUT! (read on)\n\nI love Matt's - the food is amazing! I love that Matt and his wife are so friendly and they always remember me whether I come into Matt's or The Roosevelt (granted, I AM pretty memorable).\n\nHowever...\n\nThe wait - it is out of control. Now I understand why Hawaiians hate mainlanders - because they have to wait at their favorite spots due to clueless tourists! \n\nHere is my solution, and Matt, if you read these reviews, seriously, consider what I have to say because I am in Mensa (not officially, but I would be if I took the test... I'm certain of it).\n\nSet aside a certain block of time for "LOCALS ONLY", for example, from 6:30 - 8:30 only locals are seated. How does one weed out locals from the lemmings in Tommy Bahama shirts and cameras standing outside? Easy. You must have a card that is punched each time you eat there, and once you have received 5 punches you are considered a local (granted, the first 5 times you go you will be treated like a tourist, but if it's your first time and you're a local, well hell, you're a tourist in my book). Once said card carrying local is verified as legit, he or she keeps the validated card and presents it from that time on.\n\nNow, I can already hear all the naysayers finding fault in this idea, including you Matt. But here's the truth - LOCALS keep this place humming. Tourists are one time tricks, although they do contribute to sales, it is miniscule in comparison to the long term revenue generated by Phoenicians. \n\nSo please Matt, do something that is not pc, but is good for the people that take care of you - take care of them back, get the locals in before Mr. & Mrs. Tommy Bahama. This is an amazing idea, and some restauranteur will read this and do it if you don't, so be the first, be a rebel - locals will love you for it, they will cheer your name in the streets and name their first born after you. \n\nLove, \n\nBrandon\n\n(dictated but not read)	0	2	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ErAKOacbkzdNAc-6fY94uQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The wait outside is just part of the ambiance and culture of this tiny little place.  I hope they don't very enlarge this place....it would so spoil it.\n\nFood....have anything.  Its all cooked to perfection with love and kindness from a kitchen staff that really cares about freshness.  My personal fav's are the Waffle and Bacon and the multi grain toast with the fresh jam typically made locally....changes frequently. \n\nThis was on Diner, Drive-ins and Dives a few years ago and its still the same bustling place as when Guy was there.\n\nSide note...this was way cool.  On our last visit there were 4 of us, and if you've been here you know there are only a couple of tables that seat 4.  So we're waiting outside when the server comes out hands us menus, takes our orders.  When we're seated about 15 min. later our food was delivered within minutes of being seated.  Helped us get in and out and helped them move a table.  Much appreciated service.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	DaBGrNfArz4ztQ9bYCfDXQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
0F8aZdaGhNb7_F_MgUh6iQ	2	2009-09-08 00:00:00	My mom took me here this morning after I arrived on an early-morning flight, we had a craving for coffee and a new place. \nFirst impression: Small brick building by what looks like a roach motel and a parking lot totally full. Some really weird icky smell was in the air too..?\nInside is cramped with little orange tables, totally kitsch and cute. The staff were all very friendly and made sure our orders were taken as soon as we were ready, even to the point that different waitresses were asking to make sure we had coffee on the way.\nThe coffee's great and I was impressed with raw sugar on each table. \n\nThe menu is small [literally] and I ordered the cheese omelette [cheddar] with mushrooms and hash browns. The hash browns were ridiculously oily. They would have been tastier without so much grease. The omelette was mediocre and I could have made the same in my own kitchen.  The whole wheat toast was probably the best part of the meal, and the jam tasted homemade and flavourful. I am not used to really greasy food like I was served [nor did I expect it] and therefore could not get through half my breakfast before my stomach started aching. \n\nThe jist? Small cafe, great waitstaff, subpar diner food. Oh, and this might be good to know: there is no restroom in the place, so if you need to use one, you will have to go next door to that sketchy motel.	3	2	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	xg6MSYJfqjvXUGl90lNoRQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

After about a 30 min wait (Saturday morning) we got a table. It is a very small place but cozy and bright as could be.\n\nFrom the coffee to the breakfast sandwich, everything was great. As long as you aren't counting calories I would recommend it to anyone.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	h6ZfuA-kmcZ7UMuVIDcN2A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
0Gf5kRoYeIrK6UDrPfIATA	1	2010-01-21 00:00:00	I consider myself an expert on breakfast. I know this place is all the rave, but I think it stinks. Let me list the reasons. First, the place is tiny. Second, you can never get in. Third, the food is OK, and their soda sucks; they serve RC! Fourth, the place is always hot in the summer. Fifth, when you finally get a seat it is uncomfortable (They serve fat people food, but yet their seating is set up for a 5'1" 100 pound girl). Sixth, it is a small neighborhood place so you would think people would be nice, but they are pretty stand offish. If you have ever been to nasty truck stop (versus a good one), this is the same type of food and atmosphere. Unless you are a yuppie and looking to slum it and want to say you experienced it, I suggest skipping this place.	2	2	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	mcyD9HLoQViKTBh8LTjK6Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
0h7OnzVZZtN1_hJDuRHPpg	5	2011-06-11 00:00:00	Yeah, Matt's definitely deserves 5-stars. \n\nDid I have to wait longer than normal for a Wednesday morning before 8 AM? Yep. But I knew ahead of time that Matt's has some hefty wait-times. (As long as I know ahead of time that I'll need to wait, I never have a problem with it.)\n\nThe service, once we were seated inside, was awesome. The waiter came over and saw that we were ready to order and didn't dally at all. He took our order and drinks at the same time. Within 10 minutes, our food was in front of us. I think that is impressive - for a place with such a long wait time, once you're inside, they get you eating as soon as possible.\n\nI had the salami scramble. I loved the huge strips of salami. The eggs were cooked perfectly - not too runny, but definitely not too cooked and dry. My friends had the chicken sausage with artichokes scramble (it was a special). They were both as happy as I was. \n\nMatt's is worth it. Go, have a great time with your friends, and eat a great breakfast.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	PNB6zpUmw7LY0XqUKpaRkw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

0xqczj_kgfTf1U9sQfcs7A	3	2011-04-11 00:00:00	Ok, so here's the deal. The griddlecakes here are delicious. And I mean good. Everything else is not so good.... I found that out this morning. So we waited for awhile and were seated in the back of the little room, not the one with the kitchen. The roof was leaking right next to us from the rain last night and it kind of smelled weird. Also, the service was not so good.... we asked for cream and never got it.... asked again.... finally got it. And this coffee needs it badly... so bad. And I'm still mad they stopped serving cream and started serving some fat free garbage. So anyway, I went with the BF for breakfast and he was getting the griddlecakes and I didn't want to get the same thing as him so I ordered the salami scramble. That thing was inedible. It had so much salami that was so fatty... the only thing I could taste was fat. Not pleasant. And the salami's texture was really chewy and weird too.... the home fries that come with it are good, the toast is not so great... came with blueberry preserves which was also not great. HOWEVER, go get the griddlecakes. They are awesome. I just can't say a place is four stars when only one thing is five stars and everything else is like 2. So there ya go. Go get some of delicious grandma's griddlecakes of awesomeness. Skip everything else.\n\nUpdate: The BF and I went again today..... what a disappointment. His bacon was waaay too peppery.... like he didn't eat it, it was inedible. ugh. We waited over an hour and got seated at the counter.... pretty lame. Got the hotcakes...they were still good, but I just don't think I'll be back here anytime soon. Sorry guys.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	d_TBs6J3twMy9GChqUEXkg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

My gripes: the crowded conditions, the wait and, occasionally, the service, which seems to suffer because of the crowd. Two times now I've had to pull a Shirley McClaine in "Terms of Endearment" (think hospital scene and an ailing daughter needing pain medication) to get my coffee refilled even once. If Matt's has space, and that seems to occur only at opening, I'll slide in and enjoy. But I'm not going to get sunstroke for it, as great as the food is (and it is great).	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	nZRjWnujMl3pzpREUOGMQw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

However, I wouldn't recommend waiting out there in the heat if it's 100+ outside that's for sure.  As for the food, the pesto pork chops and rosemary potatoes will satisfy any man's appetite.  In general, the handful of times I have been there never disappointing but I also have never been blown out of the water either.  I will still keep going back though.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	cS8jTjy2oCEG4UZel-0Ojg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

1eDuIvZATmVX-eRiLArMEA	4	2011-03-27 00:00:00	I'm a sucker for hash browns. And boy does this place do them right.  They are almost like a potato pancake, but even better.  Perfectly crispy, salty, greasy, but not overly greasy.  Everything else was just the cherry on top of the sundae.  Came here on Friday afternoon (around 1ish) and it was still packed.  We still had to wait about 25 minutes for a table, which wasn't too bad.  The place definitely needs to bogart a few more buildings and expand.  But we sat at the counter and bar stools which made me love my hashbrowns even more.\n\nThe griddlecakes were alright.  Nothing to rave about.  The rueben was good, a little too much sauerkraut for my taste, but others loved it.  The three egg scramble looked fantastic, and by the evidence of the licked-clean plates of my friends, it was a winner.\n\nDefinitely worth a 30 minute wait in my book.  A 2 hour wait?  Eh, probably not.  Even if those hash browns are calling my name right now.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	eixojNH5Ye_-OsIup8bUqQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

1j7tXljrwjvcVizE3p0cxA	4	2009-02-14 00:00:00	I'll qualify this review up front: all I ever ask for in a breakfast is a pile of extra crispy hash browns and two to three eggs, over easy.  I put the eggs on top, dump some salt, pepper, and tabasco on there, and mix it all up.  If you learn nothing else from me, learn this: that is the way to start the day.\n\nHaving said that, damn does Matt's have some good hashbrowns and eggs.  But I give it extra credit for having delicious looking pancakes, which I've never eaten, and some really damn good honey lemonade.  I had pork chops and eggs there, and I've had the T-bone and eggs there, but the meats are really just a distraction from what I love so much.	1	2	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Cwkb0lYxcGk5H4Yg2zMKlg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

We had a waffle, griddle cakes, and the 'Hog and Chick'.\n\nThe waffle was amazing, it went quick between the kids and my wife.  The griddle cakes were good as well, and didn't last much longer.\n\nI had the Hog and Chick with sausage patties, hash browns and wheat toast.  The sausage was great, most likely from the Pork Shop (as well as the bacon), the eggs were pefect, and the hash browns were very good as well.  Even the toast was excellent and came with local strawberry preserves.\n\nI can't wait to go back.  Once we got inside, the service was very good and quick.  We were in and out in just about an hour total, half of which was waiting outside.	0	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Nxh3xS5qrUZLz8PtKmwdMQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
1L8ke8BaQvXwb-k0ouTN5A	3	2008-06-25 00:00:00	My question is, if the portions were not so huge would people still be giving this greasy spoon 5 stars. I guess if you are very simple in your tastes you could give this place five stars. It is breakfast with nothing special about it except for the names on the menu. \n\nI figured it out, everybody is so goo-goo over it because its trendy! O wait maybe its because you wait outside for so long that you are even more hungover and so famished by the time you get in there that a goat turd would taste good. One more theory, the taste of the coffee made the food taste delicious. \n\nMatt is very popular in the central Phoenix area so word spread like wild fire and he has been incredibly successful by serving good quality typical greasy spoon food, and I do think it is as simple as that.	2	3	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	NemUYqVe64qySsPPXPDX_g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The fresh blueberry jam that comes with the killer fresh toast is so good I could eat it off the floor. (and possibly did cause I dropped some off my knife :). The only reason that I give them 4 instead of 5 stars is that WE GET IT you are small, you're hipster, you're non commercial...but for the love of Pete make the place a little bigger, so more than 3 people can eat inside at a time and we don't have to go on a wait EVERY time we come.

Service was nice, food was good, prices were silly, chairs were cramped, pretty much what you'd expect.  But after a while, I realized I was paying around $8 for eggs, bacon, toast and hash browns.  Sure, it was good, but it was a little much.\n\nStill, I stop by Matt's every once in a while to enjoy the food and atmosphere.  It's a great place to take your vacationing relatives, foodie friends, or other people who you wouldn't mind being crammed into a small space with.\n\nHOWEVER: If you stop by after around 7 AM on most weekdays, or at all on a weekend, be prepared to wait.  The weekend lines are ridiculous; you can hear people proudly proclaim how they woke up at 2:00 AM to drive down from Flagstaff to get the food.

The place is small and it's popular - put those two facts together and there's a wait.  In the summer - yea, it's tought.  Now - that being said, I usually go to a place just down the street (don't know the name, but it's a 30 second walk to the south from Matt's) and have a bloody mary inside (or you can get coffee, juice, whatever) and do my wait there while reading the paper.  So, this works for me - no big deal.\n\nOnce seated the food is simply great.  If there's a better restaurant serving fresh, sometimes creative breakfast fare in Phoenix I'd love to know about it.  But, as a Phoenix native, I haven't found an equal yet.\n\nI usually get the "five spot".  Simple, delicious and reasonably priced.  I've had the specials from time to time and they've always been good to excellent.  The service is attentive and friendly.  And, as someone mentioned, the juice serving might be a bit on the small side - but it's always been enough for me and I'd prefer the excellent quality over 8 ounces of something average any day of the week.\n\nSo, take your favorite paper, prepare for a bit of a wait, enjoy the great weather (much of the year) and enjoy.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	2SW0GXcPc2eTfykYfZNeBQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
2bFkfzIfxyfrtuUkMZN89g	3	2007-12-11 00:00:00	Greasy spoon with quality ingredients cooked to harden arteries. The service was less than stellar, but the atmosphere was cozy (read: tight) and not terribly unpleasant. The food was standard tasting - this place could do with a regular deep cleaning and perhaps some attempt to de-grease the food prep. The service could also use a bit of a boost... perhaps they should partake of their own coffee - the caffeine could help wake them up a bit.\n\nThere are some great little places like this dispersed around central Phoenix that give the downtown area some great character. This one is on the low end of the group. A few small changes and this place could easily improve to a 5 star  - but since it's so popular, there's hardly a reason to change anything I suppose. \n\nI'm thankful that I live near downtown Scottsdale where awesome breakfast choices are bountiful. Matt's is worth a visit, but only just.	3	0	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	oaaEXgQ3x51cXE3GTXrT1Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
2KrKK2UdIG2EDJkakw2XJQ	2	2013-10-09 00:00:00	I ordered 2 eggs over medium hashbrowns & the Griddle Cakes. My husband had the Classic Reuben. \n\nSERVICE - 2 stars - Waitresses were rude. And were transparently erked when we asked for Non Dairy Creamer.\nTASTE - 4 stars - Food was really good. But my eggs were over easy not over medium, the way I ordered them. \nVALUE - 1 star - they give you 2oz of syrup for an entire order of Griddle Cakes... then charge you $1.50 for every 2oz of extra syrup you order. My husbands Reuben had hardly any meat on it. \n\nOVERAll - 2.3 ... Taste was excellent but service and bang for my buck did not meet, even my most minimum of stanfards.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nWill I be going back?... probably not. \nWill I recommend to a friend... NO!	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	KoVg8FqKefi3sKgbttGLQw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
2nfvVmV4nUOxjgld4oObpw	4	2010-08-11 00:00:00	My Dad has been wanting to try this place since he saw it on the Food Network. Well, now that he's in town, he got his chance. \n\nIt's a great little place to get breakfast. And by little, I mean very little. Matt's is tiny. We went on Tuesday morning, at 10am, and waited about 10 minutes to be seated. The first thing that opened up was at the counter. If you go on Saturday or Sunday, good luck. \n\nHaving said that, everything else about Matt's is great. I had some great griddle cakes there. I didn't even have to order a side, those three pancakes filled me up for hours! My dad had the special, which was eggs, sausage, fontina cheese, and potatoes and toast. My mom had an egg and bacon and cheese Breakfast sandwich. No complaints across the board. \n\nThe staff does a great job in the small, crowded environment. Each server seamlessly tag teams you during your meal. One person took our order, another gave us our drinks, another our food, and another handled the bill. Somehow they're perfectly organized in what appears to be total chaos! \n\nI'd recommend checking Matt's Big Breakfast out sometime!	3	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	3cC726zwgerKNNasnidAww	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The location is cute and the place delivers wholesome foods made with fresh, organic ingredients.  The breakfast fare here is nothing spectacular, although they do simple brunch foods well.  Don't expect anything fancy or fusion.  \n\nMy waffle was perfectly adequate, and while I thought the almost spaghetti-like hash browns were interesting/tasty, the rest of my table disagreed.\n\nStandard breakfast fare done simply, nothing to write home about.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	E-wZHRXJbHFgjraopz-1LA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
2UFhgNPDwvFsLejs84Mlzw	4	2010-06-29 00:00:00	Great, real and fresh breakfast in a super cute teeny tiny spot.  The space is so small that they don't even have a bathroom and could probably only serve 20-25 people at a time.  We waited about 15 minutes on a Thursday morning, but i would assume the wait could get scary on the weekends.\n\nThe food was totally spot on.  From the thick sliced perfectly baked bread they use for toast to the honey lemonade, all the small details take this spot to another level.  I ordered the special scramble which was ham, fresh jalapeno and cheese with a side of hash browns.  Tobin ordered the Hog and Chick (pork chop with eggs) and a side of bacon.  While the entire meal hit the spot, the hash browns were the highlight with a perfect balance of crispy top browned bits to the soft buttery layer underneath. The bacon was also legit, perfectly thick cut and cooked to perfect chewy goodness.\n\nThe staff was very friendly, quick and attentive and all seemed to thank us as we as we finished up and walked out.  \n\nThis place is a definite must see as it is everything restaurants in up-and-coming neighborhoods should be.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Z-6Hpto5G0RVc2k3LJ-rRw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
2V12s1ZQarEwCqVF6hTkTQ	4	2009-12-06 00:00:00	It was cold for a Phoenix morning (upper 30s over-night) and I stood outside the hospital splashed in sunlight, surrounded by palm-trees and (oddly) shivering despite my wool army-drab button-down and $3 coffee. The doctor's visit went well and my spirits were high. Surgery was not an option. For now.\n\nA few minutes later, my host arrived in a green VW Rabbit. I love the new rabbits. She needed to get some work accomplished and I needed to address some email. A few (Phoenix) minutes later, we arrived at the coffee-shop. I ordered a mug of coffee and picked up a business card. Lux? That sounds familiar... Oh my goodness! LUX! I shot their first cover on top of the Smithfield at 5.30 on a Sunday morning in 2007 and the magazine was named after the coffee-shop in Phoenix where Mark and Cindy birthed the idea.\n\nThe world is tiny.\n\n---\n\n"My work is done. You wanna get breakfast?"\n\n"Do you even have to ask? What was that place you told me about before I left Philadelphia?"\n\n"Matt's. But there's another place I thought of that you might like as well."\n\n"Oh, yeah? What's that?"\n\n"The Welcome Diner."\n\n"Lemme find it on Yelp and I'll think about it."\n\n"Okay."\n\n"This is hard. I can't decide. Let's just go to Matt's. I'll do the Welcome in the Spring when I come back."\n\n---\n\nThe West is a unique place. The cities are different - spread out. The architecture is different, too. I can't describe it. It just feels like it belongs here in the desert. Form over function. Matt's fits in just this way. It's tiny inside and everything's painted white. A few photographs in white mats with white frames take up the rest of the wall space. The small bar occupies a quarter of the main dining area and four diner-orange tables decorated with desert plants take up the rest of the crowded and intimate space which is by now teeming with locals who're there to gather a late morning brunch.\n\nThere were two specials that morning and once our server mentioned the first, I couldn't remember anything else, but I told her that I needed some more time so that I could neatly arrange my table for a shot of the menu. When she came back I ordered the three-egg scramble with red peppers, spicy sausage (all their pork comes from Iowa!) and provolone cheese. A side of shredded hash-browns accompanied this beautiful breakfast feast.\n\nFor a joint that stays as busy as it does, the prices are fantastic. (I think everything's cheaper in Phoenix). Before tip, my tab was right around $12 and for the quality and quantity of food that I received in one of Phoenix's most popular spots, I had no complaints.\n\nWhen I make a return visit to the Valley of the Sun in April, I'll be sure to make myself an out-of-town-regular at this wonderful little place.\n\n...And maybe next time I'll run into Nate Ruess.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	bgI4ypIPKwTQeow9H2i__Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
32-ceiywGXlPu33Sdi6lrQ	2	2008-11-14 00:00:00	I have a unique appreciation for smaller, urban, phoenix based spots.  Matt's Big Breakfast was recommended from a few people in my building.  I went there a few days ago and the wait was atrocious.  When I got to my table I was given a menu.  The food seemed fairly common and nothing stuck out.  The waiter seemed too involved with tasks that I assume far surpassed customer satisfaction in importance.  At best, this was a drawn out version of an old, unmaintained, dirty Denny's.  I will not return.	2	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	D1EV7ba2zxi3sB2whjLIxA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
32gMWnSR8osgN8DbfTwFfw	4	2011-03-07 00:00:00	Be prepared for a very very very long wait and don't come hungry. What? Don't come hungry when you're coming out to eat breakfast? Exactly! Wait time may be 2-3 hours so please do yourself a favor and snack or eat light before you come. So what tempted a Tempe girl to come out to Phoenix to eat at Matt's Big Breakfast...Triple D DUH! Haha...Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives with Guy! He's the man! Who doesn't love him? I'm sure many people are stalking his eating stops. So cool, they have his face stenciled on the wall. \n\nOkay, so you get here and it's so teeny tiny that there's just a little stool with a waiting list. Write your name down and feel free to take off for a bit. Walk around downtown...bring board games...don't plan on just waiting outside because #1. There may not be anywhere to sit and #2. Your bottom will be very sore from sitting so long. This restaurant is in an old lobby of an old motel. You know, the old motels with the little detached lobby the size of a one car garage. I would not recommend bringing a group here...they will not be able to fit you. If you're not up for the experience but would like to try the food, they do have carry-out as an option and it will probably only take 15 minutes or so. Once you finally get seated you can't help but wonder, how oh how do these people work in this tiny room all day? Man! It is t-i-n-y! Okay, so now that I have stressed how small this place is (tiny) lets move on. :-) I ordered what Guy ordered, The Chop and Chick. A pork chop with eggs. It comes with toast and your choice of hash browns or home fries. The chop was smaller, not life changing, but very tasty...it had great seasoning. Only $8 too. Home fries were a five out of five. Very good! No soda machine here...they sell RC Cola by the can though. $1.25 a can...My Dad had the griddle cakes and he said that they were the best pancakes he's ever had. So funny because we talked to a waitress and she said it's just a regular batter but my dad is a pancake connoisseur and he loved them! Overall, yummy food, great prices but the wait is just way too long to make this a regular spot. I would eat here again but would definitely take it to go...maybe even eat outside where everyone's been waiting for hours.	2	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	-T_cG-7YFFvD3Cdu3v4ZYA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
3eQPkRk63CoRr2C-x6H0YA	3	2009-05-09 00:00:00	I love breakfast food. Usually there are great options for non-meat eaters. But this is really a meat-eater's breakfast paradise. We realized during the long (1  1/2 hour) wait that we would have limited offerings, but everyone leaving assured us it was worth the wait and it was too late to get breakfast someplace else. \n\nMatt's served the hottest, best tasting scrambled eggs, amazing coffee and some pretty good pancakes.  My companion ordered the tuna sandwich. Good, but not worth the wait. Four stars for the food, minus the wait and the choices.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	g1P3KlkiA3MUwt4Pvm0SXA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

They don't have tables big enough for 4 (it's a smallllll place) so we sat at the counter. Everyone's food was great. ONLY problem was for some reason, the waitress refused to give my husband water. I say "refused" because it turned into a joke but he asked her like 4x and still didn't get water.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	xpvDS_PmlqkQDGkUesNdaA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

3o2RSTMsts6yUumPh0U-Bw	4	2009-01-24 00:00:00	Ooh, I can help push Matt's to past 100 reviews! \n\nBefore, I only got stuff by takeout because the wait was just too much. This morning, decided to just suck it up. The fact that the downtown farmer's market is right across the street helps. I recommend signing the wait list before you're actually hungry and go check out all the local vendors.\n\nI previously had the hog and chick with "off-the-bone ham." Mmmm....the ham is always flavorful and just the right amount of tender. I love how the toast is actually hunks of sourdough or wheat rolls with jam that's not a little Smuckers packet. Back to what I ate this trip, I finally had their Belgian style waffle. It was bordering on perfect--crispy in all the right places and steaming and soft inside. I love how they serve the syrup warm. The bacon was thick but not too dense. And the freshly squeezed orange juice of course complemented it all. Hard to believe that they don't add any sugar to the juice. I like how the hash browns aren't greasy like what you'd get at IHOP or Denny's. \n\nThe staff are quite friendly and make sure you've been attended to. The atmosphere in the little red brick house is a jovial neighborhood diner feel. Our wait was not quite half an hour but that's after we returned from the farmer's market to check on our wait. Time it all before you're actually starving and you'll be good.	2	2	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	FcVQPI-ulgIXJcl5580YeA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
3oAcKDaWZVeMHHCd293BmA	4	2012-12-29 00:00:00	This is the best breakfast joint in the valley of the sun.   I have been here many times and the average wait time is about an hour.... but is totally worth it!\n\nFood:  The food here is great!  Everything is freshly made and full of favor!  My favorite is their pork chop with eggs... and you must get their rosemary home fries and wheat toast!   Also thick cut bacon as a side!  The bacon is what keeps bringing me back to this place.   They are thick cut and peppered... 3 slices for $2.95 might be a little pricy but they are really good!  \n\nTheir daily specials are also very good, most of the time is some type of egg/ sausage scramble.\n\nI also love their homemade bread and jam.  Matt's switches up their jam favors.\n\nService:  Their staff is great!  Very friendly and attentive.  But you must prepare to wait... the only time that I didn't have to wait was when I got there 10 mins before opening.   Otherwise prepare to wait at least 1 hour.   They new location is more than twice the size of the old location, but wait time is still very long, especially you have a large group.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Cc_3BFaRd8PYJXC3QXAFsA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
3spw4KEZvOAzXxge2-3Q-Q	5	2010-09-06 00:00:00	Breakfast - the most important meal of the day and the best, especially if you get it at Matt's!\n\nMy biggest dilemma at Matt's is only solved by deciding I can take home what I don't eat and enjoy it later.   Plus, I have to say no whenever I can to their yummy organic chocolate milk which fills me up before my food even comes.   It is truly hard for me not to get their omelets which are extraordinary.  I get basic ham and cheese and the buttery goodness of the eggs along with the "real" ham just make any other omeletes I have had just average eggs.  Then there is the frantic moment when the server needs to know if I want home fries or hash.    Ack!  Both are the best although I have figured out that I can take the home fries home pop them in a pan the next day and my house smells like Matt's and the potatoes make everything I make to go with them taste even better.\n\nThey have scrambles on the special board that often tempt me away and the beauty is that they put in what is fresh at that moment.  Everything at Matt's is fresh and they only use the very best.  My other addiction is to their pancakes which just blow my mind.  No matter what we get I tend to get one on the side to share with my husband as while I don't want to get just pancakes I can't turn it away.\n\nThe most incredible thing I have ever had there is the Huevos Rancheros.  I even had my name put on a list to be notified when they have them and short of a 3 hour drive back into town I will get to Matt's when they call!\n\nMy husband is a true blue chop and chick fan.  He can rarely leave the pesto crusted pork chop to order other things, and then he proceeds to nibble every bit off the bone which he assures me is the whole point of the bone.  He also scores my jam as I am not a jam person and according to him and everyone else it is awesome.  I have bought it at the market from the makers as gifts.  The jam goes on the bread which is another treat altogether. Sliced thick and perfectly buttered it also is good the next day.\n\nYes the wait is evil but you just have to manage it.  There is no doubt we don't go as often as we would if it were not long.  It is hard to go on most weekends as it is a 3 hour chunk out the day (for us drive time, wait time, and yummy time), but on Saturday's you can put your name on the list visit the market and return to find yourself top of the list.  Don't fear missing your turn for if you mark down you are going to the market they will put you back at the top of the list when you return if they already called for you.  My husband also ventures there during the week as a single and says he is seated within 15 minutes any time.  Please note he is a cruel man and he is told to keep his trap shut about these solo visits as my food envy thunders in.\n\nIt is a no brainer 5 star adventure at Matt's.  If the food didn't melt my brain with sensory happiness the adorable picture of the owners' son on the wall certainly gets my heart.  Matt and Erenia keep up the great work (and the cute aprons :-))!	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	T_kpvu1nkNKIdCXUzEYb8g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
3TXcokEaVpfuFaz9lySaUQ	5	2012-06-16 00:00:00	I was afraid this place would be overrated, because most breakfast places are. I usually think, how hard is it to cook up some eggs? and most places can't cook pancakes and waffles better than my mom. I was very wrong, this place was so, so, sooooo good. I had the salami egg scramble with hash browns, everything was cooked perfectly. The toast that came with fresh preserves and butter was amazing! My husband had the waffle with REAL maple syrup (a requirement in my mind) and sorry mom, but this one was actually better than yours. With the waffle came a side of the thickest, most flavorful bacon I've ever had. I would come back here for the bacon alone! This place is well worth the wait.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	QG9ZJatKSWj5p5VrW3cfMA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Breakfast + butter + more butter = Matt's. \n\nI had an omelette which was filled with delicious cheese and as Ayesha mentioned the mushrooms had been cooked up in butter before going into the mix which is how I do it at home. The eggs were fluffy and delicious. The toast was thick. THICK. \n\nYes the wait was long. The windows are huge so you can make those already eating uncomfortable by staring at them as they eat which is sort of fun right?\n\nThe shooting pain in my left arm makes it hard to type, but with the smile on my face I am forced to try to put out this one last review before my early death to butter clogged arteries. \n\nThey also got a boost when on the way out every single staff member shouted to us thank yous, and have a good days, and come back soons. Sweet folks. I will have to go back after the bypass surgery.	6	13	7	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	K0sapHOlhlGNjx3GBeSf5A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

This is the greatest hole in the wall breakfast I have ever had! Be prepared to wait or make sure to go grab a coffee so you are ready for the 45 minutes you have ahead of you. Also, you write your name on the list yourself outside (we were newbe's and a few skipped in front of us on the list because we were too timid to write ourselves at first until we knew it was the norm). Got the special scramble and the waffle and would recommend both again. Above all though, make sure you try the honey lemonade! It is made with local honey and has the pulp from the lemon in there to show you how real it is. Will be back soon, the service was great as well :)	2	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	oR5G_kt_eYdUxkM2PT1vpw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
40GtPGkFyIHhIzPmJOgw0w	4	2013-01-06 00:00:00	Before flying out of Phoenix, we decided to fuel up by having breakfast here.  We were drawn to the location based on the number of reviews.   So, we decided to give it a try.  \n\nWe ate in their new location, apparently, the restaurant was down the block and about 1/2 the size it is now. \n\nThe staff/workers all welcomed us with friendly chat.  They all sported vans, skinny jeans, t-shirts and a zip up sweat shirts.  The industrial like environment made conversations bounce off walls which caused it to be loud and sometimes difficult to hear.  But, it was clean and service was FAST!\n\nI ordered the breakfast special.  Our waiter praised the deliciousness of their french toast and apple smoked sausage.  Wow, was he correct.  The french toast was incredible.  The sausage was good.  I normally do not eat pork products anymore, so my rating of "good"; I am sure does not do it justice.\n\nMy husband does not eat pork products, so when we asked about alternatives like chicken sausage, turkey bacon or Soy; they did not have any.  So, his breakfast choice immediately became limited.  He ordered the cheese omelet.  It was filled with mushrooms, and red peppers.  Potatoes and a side of bread accompanied his dish.\n\nThe coffee was not bad; but at the same time left us not thrilled about it either.  So, we strolled a few blocks down to buy some strong brewed Starbucks coffee.\n\nWe enjoyed our experience.  If we lived in Phoenix, I am sure we'd eat there again.  However, on our next visit; we'll probably choose another place with meat alternatives and more green chile.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	84OfPme85hyHpJ0Pfqs9HQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Some of the best toast I have ever had. Everything I saw looked great and the owners were both there, always a good sign. There was a wait and parking can be hard, but if you want a good breakfast in Phoenix this is the spot. Next time I am in Phoenix I will be going back.	2	0	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	7SaMJ4bbzb4UgxmCe7xgZg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
4ee-g2VXBlpiD5KR-OkCkQ	2	2011-10-30 00:00:00	This was a case of high expectations falling short. After seeing it on a Food Network show and reading about it in numerous sources, I had high hopes for Matt's Big Breakfast. After waiting for 45 minutes, we made it inside the tiny restaurant.  \n\nEverything was ok, but nothing spectacular. I do appreciate their no microwave, no freezer rule, but I feel it didn't live up to the hype I had read/heard about. \n\nMaybe I'm just spoiled by good Bay Area coffee options, but the coffee here was BAD. The salami scramble was pretty average and the Belgian waffle for which a lot of people rave about, was fine, but again, didn't stand out as amazing. The thick cut bacon was awesome and a nice accompaniment to the waffle. \n\nHowever, waiting for 45 minutes and feeling rushed to get out the door, just isn't worth it.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	9IF2ZMnkrZlvxCHcO0h1EQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

It was a really nice meal and the staff was really pleasant.  The decor is a little too bright for this early morning wanderer.  I'm not a morning person - I need time to wake up & charge up for the day.  I don't suggest this place for any more than 2.  I suggest avoiding the crowds and going early so that the experience isn't tainted.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	NlSgpNwRmf3ZVgJJjDTZQw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. Service is friendly, quick, and everything one should expect.\n\nI absolutely love visiting this place and encourage you to do so, as well, if you haven't already. I am one of the lucky ones who has never had to wait more than 60 seconds for a table - I'm not sure how that's worked out, but it has, and I'm grateful. That said, I would gladly wait an hour to enjoy some great breakfast fare at Matt's. I'm looking forward to trying lunch one day, too!	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	z_vJ-mcENl7aJfzUiIkHdA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I don't know exactly how they cook their eggs; I just hope that whatever they do, they keep doing it. It's tasty. \n\nI have friends from Tucson who crash at my place on an occasional weekend, and every Sunday morning before they head back to the Old Pueblo, they insist on my taking them here. They're as addicted as I am. \n\nLong lines on Sunday mornings so expect a wait and bring good conversation topics with you.\n\nNOTE: MrK took some great shots of the place that you can see above. His last interior shot does indeed have Matt in the background, and the very cute Gretel toward the right (she also waitresses at the Roosevelt).	4	0	4	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	mIysRk_cJ5K_BMZ-r06TFw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
4O-eIoazRViy0DFwKFYTBA	4	2009-03-16 00:00:00	Believe it or not, I finally had my first Matt's experience this morning... I'd been hearing about Matt's Big Breakfast for ages, but never really wanted to make the drive to wait forever just for a greasy breakfast!\n\nHowever, we were talked into Matt's by some friends of ours that were also Matt's virgins... we met there around 10am, only to find that there were about 2 full pages worth of names ahead of us, and that they would not quote a wait... Matt's was smaller than I imagined, so I knew it would take awhile.  We debated going elsewhere and even went over to The Turf for coffee.  (If the service there were better there, we probably would've just stayed there, but we figured if we were going to wait, we'd just wait for Matt's).  My pregnant friend went into Matt's at one point to use the bathroom and they told her she had to go to the hotel nextdoor and 'ask for Mike.'  That was a bit shady...\n\nAbout an hour and a half later, our party of four was seated... and needless to say, we were all starving by then!  We started with some fresh squeezed OJ and coffee.  (The OJ glasses were tiny, but each sip tasted like heaven... and I was pleased to see that they use coffee fresh from Cave Creek Coffee Co.)\n\nWhen it was time to order, I was extremely disappointed that after that long wait, they were out of whole wheat toast.  I ended up getting an egg white omelette (yes, they do egg whites), hashbrowns, sour dough toast + preserves.  I could eat only about half of it... but what I did eat was good, greasy, and filled me up for most of the day.\n\nI don't really see myself rushing back to Matt's again anytime soon - unless it's on a weekday when the wait isn't so bad.  But I will say I'm happy that I finally made it to Matt's - and oh, what an experience it was!	11	7	12	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	dIIKEfOgo0KqUfGQvGikPg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
4TxGN5Vi6xjxUQ13-OzOXw	3	2010-11-11 00:00:00	Dunno if you can really call it a big breakfast, but it's usually a good breakfast.\nSeems like it's a scratch cooked kitchen because the food seems so fresh and tasty.\n\nWe liked the salami scramble with the fresh baked wheat toast,, it works well.\n\nSweet as sugar, attractive waitresses who are appreciative of their customers and seem to be right there for ya. They always remember you.\n\nBeware that you are charged for all drink re-fills except coffee, and they may not mention it to you,, and suddenly your bill doubles.\n\nYeah,,, you have a wait, even for the 5 seat counter,, and sometimes they'll seat an employees family member way ahead of you,, and sometimes forget to check the sign-in list and customers are left stranded outside and ignored,, that really sucks.\n\nIf ya feel un-loved outside sitting on the on deck bench, perhaps peek inside and remind them someones waiting.\n\nBring quarters for the parking meters. A buck fifty an hour.\n\nCramped and uncomfortable seating throughout. No place for a fat man,, non-fat only.\n\nOpens at 6:30 AM and they usually call it a day roughly around 2:30 PM.\nClosed Mondays last we rolled through.\n\nI like almost everything on the menu, though it seems when a good food place gets national media attention, their quality thus backs into hell. \n\nWe'll see with Matts.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	BCy-Hut597GtNvlnx3pB4Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I was excited by the reviews and the fact that it was featured on DDD (secret foodie mission of mine is to try EVERYTHING on DDD). Well, it was worth the wait and had the best bacon I have ever tried! They were quick and attentive once inside. HOWEVER, I did wait for over an HOUR on a half broken milk crate I turned up-side down, outside in the JULY 100+ degree weather. They had one bench that seated four with some shade and the rest were out in the open. They do have a crowd and I understand a wait for good food but, it was uncomfortable. They also have an honor system scratch pad under a paper weight, that is barely monitored and I saw a few people try to sneak their names on! Thankfully, people who are hungry are ruthless and they didn't get very far! A hostess would help IMMENSELY or a police officer in case a fight breaks out ;)... \n\nOVER ALL- once I was inside, it was a good experience, fresh food, cozy atmosphere and great service!	2	2	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	dV6DEH43Cw5Puv8VGh_uQA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
4WKSWVRBzesqBVn5oUwWhA	5	2008-07-14 00:00:00	I miss Matt's!  I haven't been able to find decent, let alone great breakfast in LA. \n\nWhat I like:\n- The coffee.  Seriously people. What are you bitching about the coffee for?  I'm guessing most of you are Starbuck's frequenters that think over-roasted burnt beans = delicious coffee? That a macchiato is really a sugary drink with lots of milk?  That drinking a coffee concoction containing 1000+ calories daily is good for you?  That's what I thought.\n- The daily specials.  The bacon, spinach and cheese omelet they do sometimes is amazing.  If you are *lucky* enough to walk in on the rare occasion they are making French toast, well then you had better order it while you can.  Best freakin' French toast I've ever eaten!\n- The ingredients.  Fresh, local and organic.\n- The staff.  They are awesome.  Enough said.\n- The size.  I like the fact that it is small and quaint and that you can peer at your neighboring table's order.  And even say hello...try making a new friend instead of whining.  \n- The prices.  Perfect.\n\nWhat I don't like:\n- That it is in Phoenix and not LA.\n\nTips:\n- Don't bring your kids. \n- Order your hash browns well done.  They are PERFECT that way.\n- If you aren't a fan of waiting a little bit, go to Denny's.  Or go early!\n- Don't go to a diner if you only eat health food.  It's not called Matt's Granola & Fruit Bar.....	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	VcD3xkcHxZPzvzLH6By5jA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
501U152TuVMv1rgo_j4maA	3	2009-04-03 00:00:00	Want a simple breakfast without doodads and sprinkles? Hate when people come clapping by your table to sing Happy Birthday to little Timmy in the booth behind you when all you want is some f-ing breakfast and coffee? Matt's is the place for you. \n\nI had the pleasure of meeting Amy D for lunch here a while back. I must say I was seriously surprised how simple everything was. I don't know what I was expecting, but this is a pretty straightforward breakfast joint. For my breakfast, I had bacon, eggs, hash browns and 1 pancake that was large enough for two. I washed it all down with their honey sweetened lemonade, which I thoroughly enjoyed! \n\nSo why three stars? First of all, a three star rating is NOT a bad rating. Second, it's breakfast. There really is no way to mess up a simple breakfast. I definitely will go back to try their burgers and maybe I'll boost my rating. \n\nMatt's is A-OK in my book and I look forward to going back!	9	3	5	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	-fQPzH-e-ubDIiLQhybEjQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
52M8nX1r4h9IL8G0KrG1jA	3	2012-11-06 00:00:00	I visited a friend in Phoenix. She knew I was a breakfast buff so she took me to Matt's Big Breakfast since it was so well known around the city and the country. I enjoyed my meal but "big breakfast" was a bit misleading.\n\nFor starters, I thought the breakfast menu was particularly small and the options on the menu were strange. There was a breakfast sandwich, cheese omelet, pork chop and eggs, pancakes, salami scramble, waffle, oatmeal and frosted flakes. Yes, you could order frosted flakes for $4.50. Why? I don't know. Nothing really appealed to me on the menu which was strange.\n\nI chose eggs over easy, bacon and hashbrows with toast. The bacon was phenomenal. This may have been the best bacon I've ever had. The hash browns were thinly shredded and very crispy but not burned in the slightest. The toast was thick and chewy with homemade jam. Everything I ate was excellent.\n\nThe service was atrocious. I ordered a coffee. I got one cup which was luke warm. I asked for a refill but that refill never came. I asked for water and that didn't arrive until the end of the meal. No one checked on us after we got our food. \n\nI heard they moved to a new place which is nice, industrial and modern inside (think Chipotle) but it's small. The lay out is also stupid and there is a lot of wasted space. \n\nEven at 9am there was a 1/2 hour wait to eat. I don't know if it's worth it. The food is excellent and well prepared but the rest is a bit of a mess. The menu may be small but it's all done well. I don't think I'd wait very long to eat here again. I've had better breakfast in Phoenix and I'd go there instead.	1	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	EbbOIQ5oAamS9D_B_7cC7w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
53xdPElg0rVniJM_DiIJew	5	2007-02-22 00:00:00	yep, good ol' simple home cooking, and by 'home cooking' i mean back when no one cared that there was about three cups of butter in per serving.\n\nif you've never gone, don't be scared off by all the butter references, it's not that bad. the place is teeny tiny, and our table of two had to wait about 10 minutes for a place, parties of more than four, you'll probably have to get split up. \n\nthe omelettes are wonderful, and the rosemary home fries are too good. the bacon is so good.. i can't even describe it. let me stress i am NOT a pork fan, and rarely eat it. i never eat bacon from a restaurant since i'm so picky about it. everyone raved about it here, so i dived in and thought, 'what have i been missing my whole life?' ha ha, yeah, i has an awakening of pork love right in the middle of the joint! seriously, it's unbelievable.\nit's worth the trek no matter where you're coming from, especially on a sat morning. afterward we checked out a small famer's market that was going on right up the street, and then popped in Circles records and tapes, also within walking distance.\n\n***Update 3/8\nI just went over the weekend and we waited more than 45 minutes. i was ok with it, but i was with someone who does not really place value on waiting a little longer for great food, which kind of put a damper on things. def do not bring someone here who is not willing to wait for a good thing.	2	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	HhVNG_1NOEyxfxudd6TSCg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
59B22qZBLgDvmYu6J-yThg	5	2010-01-18 00:00:00	I had their belgian waffle, which came with bacon and advertised real cream butter and real maple syrup. Also got orange juice and my girlfriend got a salami-egg scramble thing.\n\nThe lady's salami-egg scramble was great (and a new taste!) but my waffle was THE BEST WAFFLE I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. I sipped my tiny $2.50 (I think) orange juice and FELL OFF MY CHAIR, AMAZED BY THE DELICIOUSLY SWEET FRESH SQUEEZED OJ.\n\nAfter being revived by my frantic girlfriend, I quickly JUMPED UP AND HUGGED EVERY EMPLOYEE IN THE BUILDING.\n\nTrue story.\n\nWe went at 1:30 PM on a Sunday and sat right down-- your mileage may vary as this place is apparently legendary and I hear can attract quite a crowd when busy. There's like 10 small tables in the whole place plus a bar, and virtually no parking, and no shade, so don't expect to be catered to (outside of delicious food.)\n\nAlso, Matt has inspired a new invention: fresh squeezed orange juice shots. Seriously, I'd buy a few if they existed.	0	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	rx1A0tKHLxP6XEtlt3Q4Zg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
5A3DpQzSTxZmzmMxH2_ePA	1	2009-09-03 00:00:00	Went to matt's the other day to see what the rave is about and just as I expected nothing but self perpetuated hype with the help of the food network nothing more. The service was ok the coffee nothing special and my hog and chick was very unremarkable at best. It was not that the food was bad, however, if you can't be seated right away it's not worth the wait. This is not a special place. No gem to find her just pricey breakfast food and there are other choices that you can do better with. I saw a guy paying for his breakfast using three different credit cards....I mean what did he eat? And how much did it cost!!!!?? Anyway, if you are into over hyped breakfast joints and food that is mediocre at best then you may like matt's. Nothing against them but you guys are not all that when it comes to what you serve and your 15 minutes of fame has long been expired. Making people wait to eat here is nothing more then for show..trust me this is my review and I was seated right away just imagine if I had to wait in line what the review would say. Save your money and look elsewhere for the start of your day. I give matt's 5 stars for boring me with their breakfast and coffee and I give them another 5 stars for being able to convince people to pay over five dollars for a lacluster breakfast which amounts to culinary rape of one's taste buds. Do yourself a favor when you pass by this \nplace and your hungry just drive past and go to any other nearby spot that won't   Molest your good senses.\n\nTo make it you have to rely on your food and staff........not guy fieti and the food network!	0	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	uvHf_6v6e_A5ImqkfOCKaw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Yeah the wait is long...the place is small...once I went in the summer and I was sweating in my coffee...\n\nBUT....\n\nThis is Phoenix people. When the breakfast choices are a tasty meal at Circle K (heated under heat lamps) or Denny's and IHOP, you can't beat Matt's. \n\nI love breakfast. I eat breakfast everywhere I travel on business. I have never had a better breakfast than at Matt's. Fresh ingredients, great food, excellent bread and jam...kick $ss hashbrowns.\n\nI wish the place was bigger (and cooler) and the wait not so long.

5FxGpCFNEPSJUzO6eFFnqg	3	2010-04-25 00:00:00	Overrated, overrated, overrated.\n\nThe food was OK, the service sucked, they don't have ranch dressing, and they don't  have any restrooms on site... which is unacceptable in my opinion.\n\nAfter waiting over an hour and listening to all the people raving about how good the food was outside, I had high hopes. My over easy eggs were soupy, more like under easy, nasty, and the guy next to me complained hes eggs were soupy as well. Something as simple as eggs should be cooked to perfection if this place was so good. The bacon and ham were pretty good, but nothing extra ordinary. The hash browns were soaked in butter and cooked with some short of pepper mix that tasted like crap. The pancakes were just pancakes with maple syrup, tasted exactly like pancakes from crackle barrel, whatever. The only thing at this place I can honestly say was the best I've ever had was the whole wheat toast. \n\nThe food was ok. If their wasn't a wait it would be worth eating at, but other then that, places like Chompies and The Breakfast Club are far superior.	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	3jEY4FCJ04PXulzBHvlpsg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
5iHzoSCzYgJSACL2aiFXzg	4	2006-09-18 00:00:00	Midwestern hipster breakfast of champions - that's how I would describe it in 5 words.  \n\nGood down-home breakfast, but not for weight watchers.   Bright orange formica counters and rooster orange juice glasses.  Love that the place is smaller than a shoebox.  It means you have wait ahead of you, but it keeps the breakfast experience a friendly intimate one. \n\nThe hog and chick is what I usually order. But most recently I've been ordering the sopressata salami scramble with provolone and the five spot breakfast sandwich.  The burger buns are a lackluster choice, but the grilled onions and thick peppercorn bacon slices more than make up for it.  The hash browns can be a bit greasy, but hey, that's what happens when you cook with butter.  \n\nCan be a wait on weekend, but worth it in central Phoenix, especially when the Good Egg and other places get old.	2	2	4	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Yej5B4nd8PqpHMQcmCTDrg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The staff is intelligent, friendly and efficient. There is sometimes a wait to eat here, but they have a waiting list and try to get new customers in quickly. I have eaten here twice this school semester (it's very close to the ASU downtown Phoenix campus) and I keep talking new classmates into going back with me. The ingredients are fresh and very high quality. No wonder they were featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive- ins and Dives. Yum! Try the omelet, it's my favorite.	0	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	_9WKSGfBn193Wl3vd7kt1A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

5Nn_3YbIa6yqpTU-qVaHQA	2	2012-03-14 00:00:00	I know this isn't going to sit well with a lot of Yelpers, but I was markedly underwhelmed by Matt's.  I had high expectations considering the avid reviews (and the feature on the Food Network), but frankly, I was disappointed.\n\nI was expecting quite the wait to be seated considering the popularity of the place (and the line when I got there), but since I was dining alone, I was seated immediately.  Unfortunately, my seat was at a bar along a window that faced the hot Arizona sun.  I had to wear sunglasses while dining.\n\nI started with a cup of coffee.  It was fresh, but not particularly flavorful.  Anyway, that's not really where I'm hung up on this place.  What do you expect for a buck thirty-five?  No, my issue was with my food.\n\nHere's what I ordered: a Salami Scramble (basically scrambled eggs with salami) and a side of bacon.  The Salami Scramble was served with hash browns and toast.  The biggest disappointment of the meal was easily the Salami Scramble.  Having read good things about the entree, and upon recommendation of my server, I was excited to try the scramble.  Unfortunately, the scramble failed to live up to the hype. While the eggs were cooked perfectly (not too rubbery and not too runny), the overall flavor was off-putting.  The salami tasted okay, but in conjunction with the eggs, and the overpowering use of herbs, the final product was less than delicious.  Even after slathering the whole thing in catsup and hot sauce, the herbal and earthy overtones were overpowering.  I had the same problem with the hash browns: they were entirely overpowered with herbs.  I found myself actively trying to pick out the rosemary permeating the potatoes.\n\nAs far as the bacon goes, it was undercooked.  I like my bacon relatively crispy, perhaps more than others, but still, this was very chew.  The toast was fine.\n\nBecause of how much positive buzz this place has I may try it again - perhaps I was the victim of a rare poorly prepared meal here.  As it stands now, though, I'm less than enthused.\n\nLay off the herbs - they're best used sparingly.  They're potatoes, not a salad.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	UDEsNcES3AxzfKyRFLvt6Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
5PZjoS9btLxseevHo78qFw	3	2009-09-16 00:00:00	Ok. I started coming here when Matt could only get the local downtown area news channel to cover his place. It was only open for about 2 weeks and you could walk in at the height of the lunch hour and grab a table or spot at the bar. That was then and the food "F" rocked! Ok flashed forward to present day! Service is still pretty good, the wait can be a bit long, the food now is just ok. It has lost it's charm a little. Menu is sit short. If you are in the area and can afford to kill 30 minutes for a spot then check it out.	2	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ef46W1Fp4uBiNjy0c6rQqg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
5r0Nb5sQr4M89tHPdAahtw	4	2012-01-04 00:00:00	Another breakfast in the books, thanks in part to yelp and the devoted food review culture. Upon arrivng at Matt's Big Breakfast, the line is insanely intimidating. If we weren't so far out of Scottsdale, I'm not sure my girlfriend and I would have withstood the wait. Boy were we happy with our decision to stay. The wait lasted about 45 minutes and we were in and out of the restaurant in about a half hour. I ordered the Five Spot sandwich and my beautiful girlfriend ordered the pork chop meal. We both had water with our meals and the total cost was $19.06. The wait staff is fairly attentive, nice, and very efficient. Unfortunately, we buffered the wait with coffee drinks from Royal at the Market coffee, located just down the street, and they told us at Matt's that outside drinks are not allowed which kinda sucked being that we just waited for 45 minutes in the hot sun. At this point, our expectations were very high and we were a little irritated by the wait, therefore the food had to deliver BIG...and it pretty much did. My sandwich was on a great brioche bun that was loaded with cheese, sunny side up egg, and two great slices of bacon. I also ordered a side of homefries which were perfectly seasoned with herbs and grilled onions. We both agreed the homefries rocked. My grilfriends pork chop was fried and came with this interesting light basil pesto shmear that was perfect. Her eggs were scrambled and the hash brown potatoes were more like a potatoe pancake and she liked it. Her dish also came with local sourdough toast and a great mixed berry jam. Nothing in this meal was cooked bad or served cold. We will probably return again as long as the temperature outside permits. One last FYI: Beware showing up in large groups.	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	hF_p4TBpfepPJ96YXX7LOA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
5RHa6ARjqHnjkk2puc5y_w	4	2008-09-17 00:00:00	I'm sure it's excellent -- but after waiting on line for 30 minutes on a Saturday morning, we sat down and realized that their menu is pretty small, and almost all dishes contain some sort of pork. That narrowed our choice to pretty much pancakes (just say "killing me softly with your buttah.."), so we bolted -- to Palatte. \n\nI'm sure it's great if you like good ol' home cookin' diner food, but for this New York food snob, the choices are too few to wield my wallet.	3	2	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	7I9Yimlq3so64eCcFsVw5Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
5XDrM2w3HJ5o6jx6bm3G_Q	5	2012-11-11 00:00:00	What I Ate\n- waffle\n- bacon\n- 2 scrambled eggs\n- hashbrowns\n- glass of milk\n\nWould I Go Again?\nYes--I had a fantastic breakfast at Matt's.  I asked the waitress what are the most popular items on the menu, and one of the items she listed was the waffle.  The waffle was so good!  The batter was great, it was cooked perfectly, and the sweet cream butter and maple syrup completed the waffle's deliciousness.  The hashbrowns are my all-time favorite hashbrowns!  No competition.  The eggs were good (hard to go wrong with scrambled eggs), and the thick bacon was delicious.  Big thanks to Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives for helping me find this little gem in Phoenix!	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	dzUXXZ4z_F4cmrBWUrcPSw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

What more can you ask for?  Oh, maybe a few more tables to shorten the wait.  But that's all part of the charm!

It doesn't matter how big they make the diner; there will always be a line to get in there!  The simple secret is the fresh, real ingredients they use, locally-sourced whenever possible.  When you're a regular, they know your name and your order.  Big plus, in my book, is the new digs have a bike rack.  LOVE Matt's Big Breakfast!  It truly is as good as it gets.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	U4qKtWpJgDdeA-nxqKU_jg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I was not impressed by the veggie section of the menu...oh wait, there's not one...and no, I don't like oatmeal or f-ing grapefruit for breakfast.  ick.

6FJFwe3msXJV5G4zGIPV8g	4	2013-01-22 00:00:00	This place was featured in Food Network and since I was in town, I thought I'll give it a try.  I got there around 12pm (rush hour) and waited 45 minutes for a table.  The staff was very friendly and helpful but super busy.  \n\nCoffee was your typical coffee, nothing special there.  The salami scramble was to die for, the flavor was amazing!  The waffles were awesome, so fluffy and soft.  The bacon was thick but it was too burnt for my preference.  The fresh jam on the thick white toast was delicious!  \n\nOverall, the food was excellent and it was worth the 45 minutes wait.	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	6-46xKhOQChoBOShWjp3Hg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
6gMS65TUMj_DtRBLxQ1s-g	4	2011-03-10 00:00:00	First off, we went with a group of six on a Tuesday morning at 10:30am and STILL had to wait about 45 minutes for two tables of 3.  BUT, the food was worth the wait as I had the delicious special with jalapeno and sausage scrambled, with hash browns and a fresh tortilla.  Awesome!  Great coffee too!  In fairness the line moves pretty fast, but this is a small place so if you're considering coming with a big group, be forewarned that you'll wait longer for a table together.\n\nWe also learned while we were eating that Matt's was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network.  So that may be the reason for the business too...fewer locals and more looky-loos.\n\nRegardless, I'd go back in a flash and highly recommend Matt's!	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	iiQAk1fM5_WqngmNYQwrmQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
6JSsuhCWu6j2HWL02980ig	2	2008-03-31 00:00:00	EVERYONE hyped this place up waaaaay too much. I waited with 2 friends for 1.5 hours. I got a Cheese/Sausage omelet with grilled onions... it came with a piece of toast, 2 eggs (I think), and hash browns.\n\nPeople seem to talk about the hash browns... I don't see whats so special. Shredded potato that's burnt on the top and bottom, while hella soggy in the middle... is not my idea of damn good hash browns.\n\nIn my honest opinion, if you like A LOT of butter on everything, as well as waiting in line for a hour and a half, for a chance to sit down in a crazy small restaurant... then this is the breakfast stop for you.	3	3	4	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	wmDi1eznxvWLjy2SZu8r_A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

6rd7ubD8BJFu3o7mdTsq5g	3	2010-01-21 00:00:00	This is a small place with a big name. Luckly we went after the lunch rush about 1:15 and had to wait only 15 min. This is a small place and we had 4 people, so they had to put two tables together for us. We ordered the griddle cakes, the hog and chick, salami scramble and the chop and chick. The wait time on the food was average and it came out hot and straight from the kitchen (which was not far away). The griddle cakes were very good, light and fluffy. The warm maple syrup and real butter were good touches. The salami scramble and the hog and chick were good , but nothing special. The chop and chick was highly recommended to me so I was excited to try it. The flavor was good , but they over cooked it a bit. It was on the dry side and did not wow me. I did like the hash browns. As a rule I have not found any place that does good hash browns.This place does. Crunchy on the outside without being dry on the inside. The service was good and the overall experience fine.	2	2	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Og3hhupcQKP0rWO9roOFig	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
6SLsBFMvSmYPa4dgMeH39g	3	2011-04-13 00:00:00	Matt's Big Breakfast!  Best breakfast downtown!  Guy Fieri's been here!!!!!\n\nHold on a minute.... once you get over the hype, unfortunately, you find that Matt's is just average.  We went recently and contended with the customary long wait for our table.  Once seated in the cramped, homey space, we were ready to be dazzled.  Problem is, my griddlecakes were just average.  In fact, the pancakes I make at home (America's Test Kitchen recipe) are probably better.  My daughter's waffle was fine, but again, nothing extraordinary.  Our waitress seemed to always be forgetting something - water, oj, side dish, etc.  For the hassle, Matt's is not worth it.  I'd rather have breakfast at Province in the new Westin down the street.\n\nOnce you get over the hype, you'll get over Matt's.	3	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	VfAfrBGohcjD_CRCwuKz6Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
6UkskL0TfK4EPUWylHzSlg	4	2011-12-07 00:00:00	Honestly, I wait in line for the bacon. \nMatt's bacon is not for everyone, that's for sure. Vegetarians, look away! 'cause this stuff is fatty, medium-rare, meat candy! The pepper sounded off-putting to me until I tasted it, and oh, how I enjoy it.\nBeen there many times and whenever my Foodie brother is in town, he takes me there so he can get 2 or 3 orders of bacon.\nGreat on the side of their Griddlecakes, which taste like a combination of a corn muffin and a pancake. De-lish.\nWorth the wait.\nOh, and remember: this is a Divey Diner in an undesirable section of Downtown Phoenix--so SNOBS BEWARE!\nThe rest of us will continue to enjoy the homemade goodness.	2	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	gYjP8zOIJaXh9MrhqqzwRg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
6wETtT3xwYBf9V092Yr3UA	5	2009-11-07 00:00:00	So I have this thing about long waits at breakfast places.  Every town in America seems to have at least one annoyingly popular place with a line  around the corner and overrated pancakes, omelets, etc.  Having visited Matt's on two previous occasions I found it to be great, but because it violated my "line theory" I've resisted embracing it.  Until now.  After meeting a friend at Matt's for breakfast this morning (and waiting about 30 minutes) I can honestly say that this place is the real deal.  The food isn't gourmet or even creative, it isn't supposed to be.  Rather it's classic breakfast done to perfection.  Exceptional pork, eggs, potatoes, breads, everything.  Although it pains me to say it, this is a breakfast place worth waiting in line for.	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	vS3vli7SJRzreK2p2_DUYQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
6Xw4FnQ4tdQli8DmCNxtHg	4	2009-12-07 00:00:00	This place was on the DD&D places my family wanted to go while in town, I joined them since I'd heard plenty about it but never gone.\n\nThe place is small, so yes there is going to be a wait.  You chose to eat there knowing this so complaining about the wait is pretty ridiculous.  That said, I'm not sure if I'd attempt coming here on a weekend, but during the workweek it was fine, the wait was maybe 20-30 minutes.\n\nThe food was great, the coffee was strong.  My only complaint is with more than one person checking on our table we asked for water from them 2-3 times and I don't think they ever came back with it.  Wasn't that big of a deal but seemed like it wasn't that hard since they were checking on us about every 2 minutes (got the feeling of being rushed through our meal, but maybe that is their way of keeping the flow of folks coming in and out).	3	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	EyLVCFOKltmlMg7XcRxU9Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

7a7iDpW2_koYDhOwPl_p-w	5	2007-06-25 00:00:00	This is not a place for the calorie conscious, so dieters need to swear off this place like the plague. Even the salads here are smothered in bacon, eggs, cheese and dressing. But if you feel like punishing your arteries in the most delicious fashion, I highly recommend Matt's Big Breakfast. I've heard from just about everyone I know that this place is the bee's knees, the elephant's eyebrows, the eel's hips...and the buzz wasn't wrong. \n\nThis place has some amazing hangover food, so after a night of indulging we arrived at this little diner around noon thirty and had to wait about twenty minutes to be seated. The temperature was well over 100 degrees by that point, which is not good on the dehydrated and hung over, but they were kind enough to provide a giant tub of ice water so that waiting diners didn't drop like flies before they could be served. Two stacks of complimentary foodie magazines were also present for perusal, but my brain didn't feel like thinking yet. However, by the time we were done with our dining experience at one twenty, there were empty booths all over the place, so if you're impatient, go during the last hour they're open.\n\nOnce inside, we sat at the bar, right in the path of the air conditioning vent, with a clear view of the kitchen going ons. Seeing how I drank my share of water outside I ordered an RC Cola (I didn't even know that brand still existed!) that came in a can. While waiting to order, I did some pretty extreme rubbernecking, judging the deliciousness of every dish that came out of the kitchen or was being munched on by others. The menu was modest in size but boasted that they used the freshest organic ingredients whenever possible, and after watching everyone else I was pretty excited when the time came to order. \n\nI decided to go with my traditional breakfast fare, so I could accurately compare it to other brunch joints: eggs over medium, bacon, hashbrowns and sour dough toast. The Hog and Chick!\n\nAnd. It. Was. Heaven.\n\nIt's clear that everything they offered was as fresh as it could possibly be. The toast tasted freshly baked, doughy yet crisp, and was delicious dipped in my eggs. Thick cut peppered bacon melted in my mouth. The hashbrowns had to have been made on the premises, because they looked exactly like the ones I make in my own home, greyer than the freezer variety and a bit gelatinous. There was even a tiny tub of fresh apricot puree that tasted like there wasn't a lick of processed sugar added. \n\nAnd everything was drowned to a lovely crisp in butter.\n\nI only wish it were in Tempe instead of Phoenix, because I'd love to try the other menu offerings. It's cheap, delicious, friendly, and some of the best damn hang over food I have ever had.	7	6	7	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	dyhTHLIf6eWBvU78Y3T06A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Today they had a great steak & eggs special, it was out of this world. I brought a friend who had never been there, and she loved her food as well. One thing I recommend is to order a pancake on the side (in case no one in your party orders a full order). The pancakes are unreal, they are SO good, and if you've never tried them, do yourselves a favor, and try them.\n\nAs usual, service was on point, and even though the place is packed and super busy, everything was taken care of. When I read negative reviews of the place, all I ever see is complaints because there is a wait, etc.\n\nIt is important to note, this is NOT an IHOP, or Goodegg. You WILL wait to get in, and it is worth every minute of the wait. If you're not able to do that, then perhaps you should go elsewhere. Also, if you have more than a party of four, please consider either breaking into smaller groups, or go somewhere else. \n\nThe food at Matt's Big Breakfast is thoughtfully planned, prepared, and executed. If you haven't been yet, enjoy it!	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	WJKocp9RE0KatUwh3_DkGg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The omelettes for vegetarians doesnt make the cut for me as on top of not having too many options for vegetarians, they charge much for every single topping on it. \nThe place isnt as big as the name suggests ;) but I love places like that which remind of an old house converted into an eatery. dont get me wrong, but the place is too small, but is super popular in circles, so expect a long wait time, we waited for 30 mins for 2 PM on a Tuesday. \nBut the price suits well for the Big in the name, the servings arent as big though as the name suggests.

7nZnGSmSl2lCDedt7FxAYA	5	2009-10-02 00:00:00	Being a huge fan of breakfast (who isn't?) I got really excited when I found this place using my handy dandy Yelp app on my iPhone. You see, me and 3 of my friends were in Phoenix to see the Dodgers play the Diamondbacks in a big league game at Chase Field. The bad news is the dodgers lost, but the good news is we had breakfast the next day at Matts. \n\nReading the reviews on Yelp got me way excited to eat there. People were raving about this place as if it was a small piece of heaven on earth. \n\nWe walked there from our hotel and Were quickly seated. Our first thought was, 'tiny'. But we liked that about the place. Very cozy and welcoming. Old school almost. \n\nI ordered the pancakes with a side of egg and bacon. I always have to try the pancakes first whenever I go to a new breakfast joint. It's my measuring stick. If the pancakes suck, most likely everything else will also. \n\nAfter waiting about 10 minutes the kind and very friendly waitress began to bring our food out. One at a time. Over a few minutes. She explained to us that they only had one grill so they would bring out the food as soon as it was done cooking. Again, 'tiny'. \n\nLet me tell you the wait was worth it. The pancakes were amazing. Soft, fluffy, stick to the roof of your mouth goodness. The best pancakes I have ever had. Not to mention the maple syrup was amazing. Top notch bacon and the eggs cooked like my mom made them. I was in breakfast nirvana. My only regret was leaving bits of pancake on my plate. After eating different, but equally amazing, items from my friends plate I was full. I felt like I had let my pancakes down. \n\nAs we left the restaurant we did the touristy thing to do and took a picture next to Guy Fieri's image on the wall. And had no shame about it. \n\nIf your in Phoenix you have to go to Matts Big Breakfast. There's nothing really 'tiny' about the flavor of the food there. \n\nOh and the people who were raving about Matts as of it were a small piece of heaven are all wrong. It's more like a bog chunk of heaven if you ask me.	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	YjlqR0Yzvm5bgmJ5XftXuQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

More so when Dottsy suggested Matt's.  \nIt was my first time, I remember it like it was yesterday.  Or, a half hour ago.\nSign-in at the door to wait to be seated.  Gorgeous day out, so no big deal.  I took a seat on the bench outside and waited for Dottsy.  Then a lady sat at the other end of the bench and my side flipped up.  \nI had heard it was small...but not *this* small!  It was really cute and the staff was super-friendly.  I had to pee, though.  Apparently, the bathroom was off the kitchen.  OK.  I hope to myself as I make my way past the grills that I am not posing a health hazard to Matt's.  I mean, I was wearing a baseball cap, but no net!  Bathroom was tiny with no mirror.  That was ok for me, because, as I stated, it was baseball cap day.  The bathroom and its location are the only reason I took a star off.\nI got the cheddar and mushroom omelet.  Came with a side of hash browns and toast.  With a little cup of jelly.  At first, I didn't know it was jelly...until Dottsy saw a man put his little cup-o-stuff on his toast. \nOmelet was huge, as was the hash brown.  The omelet was stuffed.  STUFFED with cheese and mushrooms.  I could see the butter on the plate.  Oh, man, this was gonna ROCK!  The hash brown was made from spaghetti-cut potatoes. Mmmmmmmmmmmyummy!\nI ate it all.  Everything.  I mean, I waited a half hour to be seated.  And my 20-year High School reunion isn't until July.  So, that's ok that I cleaned off my plate.  Right?  RIGHT????\nOh, and I ran into Dallas there.  Always a plus!	13	14	11	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	tJ1qdNdG0tZywbgH9uw9qw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The bacon is awesome here!\n\nTheir philosophy is great too - local, organic, etc. etc.  The place is tiny and quaint too and as always it's great to support a local independent business.  \n\nBest breakfast in Phoenix that i've had and definitely one of my fave spots - went there the next day too - got the special and it was delish - check my photos to see what we got!	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	duymKKwUruH8GwbvcaFd0w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
7WmIwzVSiExAoqoqOhgO_w	5	2008-03-23 00:00:00	This was a YELP guided breakfast stop on our Spring Training week food tour. I trust YELPers to guide me to the best places and they always come through. They were right on about the wait. Mid week around 9am and there was about a 30 minute wait with lots of people waiting outside the tiny little restaurant. Luckily we were just a 2 waiting for a seat, as opposed to the party of 9 who would have to be broken up or wait for hours to be seated.... (HINT HINT, not a place for groups. 2 is ideal. 3-4 is max unless you do not care about sitting together.)\n\nHaving been on day four of greasy high caloric breakfasts, I opted for the steel cut oatmeal with the raisins and brown sugar and an OJ. SG got standard egg plate with eggs, toast, ham and rosemary potatoes. SG was very happy when his plate arrived. The large piece of ham and the delicious rosemary potatoes set this place aside in his mind. My oatmeal was very good, but my humungous raisins put it over the top. The service was great and Matt himself was even there helping out. \n\nSG said this is how a breakfast place should be done and this is the model he would use for his own breakfast place (that will most likely never happen). The menu is limited, but offers the usuals. There is special attention paid to those things like the potatoes and the raisins that makes this place special. \n\nCheck it out. Expect a wait, bring a news paper.	2	0	6	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	VO3SB9Bxmy3AItS3KyqPmA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

It's so worth the drive...and the wait Beware...you will have at least a 15 min. wait. But it is soooo worth it! Best Waffles I have EVER had. Bacon is as it should be, thick, crispy and MEATY! I haven't even started on the homefries...YUM! They use all fresh ingredients bought locally, even the coffe is bought from a local place, Cave Creek Coffee. They have me hooked...\n\nDo yourself a favor, come down here, order ANYTHING and enjoy! You will NOT be disappointed.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	nz7Rdj2NN6pxrZ2lvTLuCQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I don't like going too early, as the American fried potatoes haven't had the opportunity to soak in enough rosemary and get that nice crisp crust from the grill yet.\n\nHands down, the best breakfast I've had in the Valley.  Bacon arrives fresh each day...I think everything does.  Coffee is terrific and then there's this woman...(Matt's wife), who just simply lights up the place.  \n\nI go to restaurants a lot...more than most...more than I probably should.  I will go once on a recommendation from someone.  I will go back again, if the place measures up.  If I go back more frequently, it's because of the people.  And Matt's is about the people.\n\nI've met great people there and although I maybe get there 5-6 times a year, they remember me.  That's cool...and very important.\n\nSimply put, I have not found a meal there I haven't liked, but most often, the Special of the Day is just out of the world delicious.  Also, just trust me here...get the American fried potatoes...again...trust me.  Delicious.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ci_n4DYtnAdGNepRt0Zfqg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

That being said, the portions were more than enough for me and I left with a full tummy. Some of the ingredients were organic and local (yay!!), but the actual food was nothing special. In fact, the raspberry preserves were the most impressive thing I ate at matt's. I feel like I could have cooked everything there (and probably more to my liking) with the ingredients in my refrigerator and saved a chunk of change.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	qxzedoItGpx2zZRh7uBHyw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I couldn't decide what to eat from their huge menu of 7items. The night club waitress informed us that the eggs benidict was the special today. So we ordered one each. Low and behold the plate was 11dollars each. I wouldn't have minded paying that if the food was good but it wasn't. Small portions and incredibly salty. Just terrible! I couldn't even eat my food. I wouldn't even go back if someone paid me. Maybe the people there should pay more attention to the food instead of trying so had to be hipsters.	3	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	wdpEgUi_h5F-6IiwxrKzKw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The servers are these bitchy girls that argue with each other and one looked so dirty I wanted to squirt her with my hand sanitizer each time she passed by me.  \n\nThe food - it's a normal breakfast.  Nothing about the meal made me think I was having something special.  Yes, the bacon was good but really, have you ever had bad bacon?  They don't have fountain drinks, just canned RC so I stuck to coffee.	12	21	6	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	TQ9A1LVp6z-fIc494RsLDQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

9G5PRWhkY3B3VYNv7RcOlQ	3	2013-11-18 00:00:00	This was our first visit to this restaurant. First, let me say that this restaurant has awesome fresh squeezed orange juice, excellent coffee, and great service. The food was generally good. Ham was tough in spots, and my meal was definitely in need of salt and pepper.The port in my breakfast special had no taste at all. Hashbrowns were somewhat burnt. I could live with this though. However, I had to mark this restaurant down due to the lack of comfort of the "urban" stainless steel stools that are provided to customers at the counters. Here I think style was a major concern over comfort, and I urge the owners in this eatery to sit on their own stools for an hour to experience the whole dining experience. While eating there, I spent most of the time trying not to slide off of these quite small, hard and slippery shiny stainless steel wonders, and since no rail to rest your feet on is provided, staying on them depends on you using the small rails along the bottom of the stool to try and stay on them. By the end of the meal, we couldn't wait to get out of there, just so we could stand up and stretch out our backs from the lack of support, hardness, and strain of trying to stay on these little torture devices. If the idea is to make it uncomfortable enough to keep the turnover quick at the counters, then they are perfectly suited for the task. However, we will strongly reconsider whether to return, and if we do, will never sit at the counter again. Good food is available all over the valley, and being comfortable while eating is also available all over the valley. \n\nAs a suggestion to attract and keep customers, I want to make a couple of suggestions:\n\nFix the stool situation. They are a big drawback.\n\nDuring the breakfast wait, instead of that watery whatever it is that you offer to all the people waiting outside (water? lemonade?), serve coffee. When the guy brought that out, many of us said "Coffee, awesome!", and then realized it was something far less appealing. By bringing out coffee and mugs (OK to use a variety from Goodwill or whatever), you will have an automatic coffee sale and people will enjoy hanging out while waiting. You can stage it from inside to control losses and offer it to those on the waiting list if you want, but it would endear a customer such as myself to the restaurant. \n\nWhen you put down the check, explain how it works. "We can take care of this for you or you can pay at the counter" would be helpful. We weren't sure what to do and had to ask.\n\nAs it is, we may or may not return to this restaurant. Might give it one more try.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	te9oDpZc6UOlgIWf6WFWKA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

9k23bNODmKINRBBWcD_R8Q	5	2012-11-29 00:00:00	Ive been going to Matt's for a couple years now and I have always loved the place. I go for the food because it's the best breakfast in phoenix, but even more for the awesome staff. The owner, who everyone calls Mama- which I think is so adorable- is one of the most welcoming and hospitable people i have ever seen in the restaurant business. Everyone seems like they love working there and they have so much fun together. \nI went this past sunday (11/18) and had a great experience with my husband. He had the steak and it was AMAZING and I had their scramble special which is always a winner. homefries with onions and fresh rosemary are so stinking good. My waitress was a super sweet red head and was so attentive. She checked on us just the right amount of times and went above and beyond to make our experience pleasant. I dont know what these people are complaining about, I've always had great service when we go on the weekends- maybe we will check it out on a weekday and see if its different. \nI was so impressed by all their local use of product and I think its awesome that they get the best ingredients they can. I didn't know how many local business they work with until I asked our waitress and she told us all the different places we were asking about. \n\nWill continue to go to Matts every weekend. Keep up the great work everyone!!	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	sUqXl4J-WMT2WCB2p-Aoxw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
9KzvDEe6Ouy7b6ZBr8cfeA	3	2011-10-06 00:00:00	So this place may be a bit overrated. I arrived around 9 on a Tuesday morning, and I only waited about 5 minutes. I was happy not to wait long, but shocked at the ridiculously small space. Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives really makes it look much bigger.\n\nI don't know if it's my roots in southern breakfast or the mediocre flavoring that caused me to leave this place without much of a lasting impression. The staff was extremely nice, and I loved the fresh squeezed orange juice. Just not worth me getting up extra to include the place in my stops before work in Tempe, AZ.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	u4df9jjhSsjnrz1wEqFjJg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
9lMpv7bJ-eO-9fGbrgbDOA	2	2013-01-25 00:00:00	Visiting Phoenix and I wanted to revisit Matt's.  I was here two years ago and I had heard that they moved, 4 months ago, to a new larger space.   \n\nThe new space is nice, but I somehow miss the tiny old one.  The little place was unique and atmospheric where the new place is cool, but somehow generic-cool.  \n\nStaff was nice enough, but it put me off a bit when they wanted $1.50 for more maple syrup.   I said OK because the pancakes were SUPER DRY.   Not good at all.   And the maple syrup is totally sub par.  Tastes like Aunt Jemima.  It's stored in big plastic jugs in the dining room.   \n\nFriend's omelette was overcooked and greasy.   Potatoes were just average.   Thick cut marble rye toast was good, but then he loves anything rye.\n\nCome on Matt, you can do better.   Spend more time training your kitchen staff.  And does your wife always wear UGGs, no matter the weather?	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	4g0NzjP-aA923EJ3Ia3CAw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Once you get in there you'll see it's a fun place to be; a combination of hip/50's dinner with real all American food (especially breakfast).  I had the salami and eggs breakfast which was ok.  I thought the salami was way too salty.  The hash browns on the other hand are amazing.  They were made from real potatoes, cooked just right with plenty of grease and I loved every bite!  I also had a cup of coffee that was average at best.  My wife, on the other hand, had a glass of lemonade that was made from scratch and was sweetened with honey which we both thought was awesome.  If you're going to come here bring a small snack you can munch on outside because the wait could be up to an hour and a half.  Best thing is to call before you come and ask how long the wait is.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	_VTkMoIa11C9IA4zlYbsOA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

a1J9vk5tIbrVQCUqMRA7jw	3	2010-09-16 00:00:00	For so long I have been encouraged to explore the breakfast happenings at this local spot in Phoenix.  I believe I am going to be one of the few who was not wowed by what Matt had to offer.\n\nMatt's gets a big gold star for its earth friendly and locavore kitchen.  The menu features "cage free eggs from humanely raised chickens", grain fed pork and natural beef, as well as local organic produce.\n\nYou will only find a breakfast and lunch menu here, and the items are unpretentious and down-home - virtually anything I could easily whip up in my own kitchen such as BLT's, tuna salad sandwhich, tossed cobb, and burgers.\n\nAs the name infers, breakfast is big here.  And greasy and indulgent.  The "five spot" breakfast sandwhich appears to be the most popular item here and comes on a roll with two eggs, two slices of bacon, American cheese, and grilled onions.  (Personally, I feel American is the worst cheese in America, and I wish that government regulators would ban it from kitchen tables.) And when you add greasy grilled onions to an already greasy sandwhich with very un-American cheese, you get some bad bed-fellows.  So, unfortuantely, this breakfast for me was under-appreciated and finished by my breakfast date who had the same thing.\n\nOther breakfast items included omelets, salami scrambles, griddlecakes, and waffles.  Notable drink items were fresh squeezed orange juice, honey lemonade, or organic chocolate milk.\n\nVene Vidi Vici.  But I likely won't return.	4	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	P2sQVHyHmy4WA0I7NI5hWg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I came here like at least 8 others that were waiting out front because we saw Matt's on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on TV so it was one of those "Hey that my town, We gotta go!"\nI ordered one of the plates I saw on the show, the Chop and Chick, a large succulent boneless pork chop, 3 perfectly cooked eggs, nice crispy brown hash browns, thick hand sliced toast, \nWhats not to like right,?\nWell waiting on the sidewalk out front at Matt's for 1.5hrs to finally get into Breakfast Nirvana, order up and here you go \n1 thin 25% bone pork chop over cooked and dry. Ever compare a Big Mac in an ad to the one you get in a box and you'll see my point here.\n3 eggs still slimy and runny, medium eggs means medium\n1 huge helping of hash browns that I could have cooked the next 6 orders of eggs with the grease they wallowed in.\nSourdough Toast, 4 stars perfect, excellent.\nSo not all bad, just way over rated, and the following day a really great breakfast at a real local spot Big Daddy's up on Cave Creek Rd and Peoria, excellent in every way and we had never been there for breakfast before but we will be back, Matt's not a chance.	3	1	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	QnHXlWabpzE_nMQzrrVHEw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
a3iJ_7os9tLmRuqMR6oEOg	4	2011-10-02 00:00:00	I was specifically looking for a good breakfast place in Phoenix. The concierge suggested Matt's Big Breakfast. I looked at some yelp reviews and figured I'd give it a try. I took the light rail over from my hotel and got off too soon and ended up doing a bit of walking in 100 degree weather. The place was small, had air conditioning, and I was hoping I wouldn't have to wait, even though the reviews said otherwise. I was by myself and able to sit at the counter right away! I ordered the belgian waffle, which had sweet cream butter, sprinkled with powdered sugar and maple syrup on the side. It was served with a side of thick cut bacon, which I have never tasted like this before - it was peppered and tasted really good! I also ordered a side of scrambled eggs. Let me tell you, the food was good - I ate my entire breakfast! The staff was very friendly too. As I was paying and getting ready to leave, I noticed a stamp of Guy Fieri's face on the wall! This place had been featured on the Food Network and I had no idea - usually I look up where he goes or places featured on Man vs. Food. I'd say stop in and check it out if you're in the area!	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	0-wgoErHRFUuhKvGo_WPVQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

aehrrXu1SrcCaRFfrEsagw	2	2011-02-02 00:00:00	I don't get the rave reviews or how anybody can claim that this is the "be all, end all" for breakfast.  \n\nPros-\nA friendly server\nDecent bacon, though heavy on the pepper\n\nCons-\nOverpriced for what you get-$7.50 for pancakes a la carte and my personal favorite $1.25 extra charge for more syrup!  With a side of bacon and a coffee that meal alone was $12 before tax & gratuity.\n1 slice of toast with a 2 egg breakfast...who does that?\n6oz Orange Juice....$2.50!\nThree in your party, oh I'm sorry you will have to squeeze into the corner with an extra chair because we won't seat you at a table for four is how the visit started!\n\nI understand why everyone claims that it is always so busy, there might be 20 seats in the entire place!  Not going to be back any time soon with all of the other options downtown for breakfast these days.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Q5W9NQKy5_t8CksrQgrl9A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
AnbjoMlB4s-zGXXlEQG-xQ	4	2010-05-03 00:00:00	This place has great food, great service, great atmosphere...but a crappy wait. \n\nI love eating at Matt's, but I don't go as frequently as I would like because of the wait. I think the food is better than most, they use fresh ingredients from the farmers market down the way, which always improves food quality.\n\nSome people don't like the size of the restaurant, but I love it! It wouldn't be as fun and intimate if it were bigger. I have had Matt's a few times, but today I went at 6:40 (10 minutes after they open) and it was incredible. There was no line and no people, making the feel of a "small breakfast joint" feel real. It was calm, quiet, wonderful and reminded me to write a review! So, if you're an early bird and can get there around opening time, I highly recommend it! Otherwise, it's good, but prepared to wait while sipping on some yummy grapefruit water.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ira4RzqjC9shmZTJEk8ZAQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

AsbkX4vOVsawtYa1ktCLrA	4	2008-10-02 00:00:00	So I'm heading out to California and I decide to "load up" before I hit the road. I've been wanting to try Matt's ever since I moved here last year. So, I get up early to try to get a head start on traffic and lo and behold, traffic. I finally get there after a few wrong turns (Thanks stupid GPS, you're going back from whence you came). I sidle up to the bar and now the decicsion begins. Eggs? Omelette? Cakes? Cakes it is and a side of bacon. While I wait with my cup of coffee, which wasn't half bad, I take in the smallness of this place. Glad I got there early. The GriddleCakes arrive with the bacon. The sweet cream they use makes other places cakes seem like toast. Rich and fluffy with the melting butter on top and real maple syrup, Wooo! The bacon was nice. Cooked to where it wasn't too crispy or too rubbery. And with pepper. Now I just hope I don't fall asleep during my drive. Oh, and what's with the metered parking. I put my .60 in the meter which should have given me an hour and I go out to my car 45 minute later and the meter says expired. What?	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	SYuMjXA13-YbpVHlX5LDAg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I'm not a fan of pork chops but thaws were flavorful, tender and just super yum!  My only gripe is that I ordered fresh, i got a bout 6oz,  for $2.75 yikes!!!\nCaution it can get crowded and its a pretty small location.

Some of the items are breakfast basics, sure, but the pancakes are anything but ordinary.  They're almost perfect.   The home fries are great - rosemary goodness. There's also a great menu selection - a nice mix of breakfast standards with unique and special twists.\n-The atmosphere.  Yeah it's small, but it's part of the charm.\n\nCon:\n-It's expensive.  There's no way around it.\n- It IS small.  You will have to wait, sometimes for a long time.	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	xOSKcPmrUkeIEbetf85WYQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Tiny little place so you will have to wait but they keep the folks rolling in and out. Been there twice and have sat at the counter both times. The Hog & Chick with bacon, thick bacon...awesome!  Eggs the way you want. Get the hash browns as they are better than you can make at home, but if you like your potatoes chunky then get the home fries but a warning for people who aren't into rosemary, home fries have rosemary on them. Fresh sliced toast and homemade jam, I think it was plum. My wife had the omelet and loved it.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	N_9v7syg7dU8K4cUq0LdxA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
AWPGEdlm3ksuTAkGXgn8Zw	2	2008-11-25 00:00:00	So I'm watching Diners, Drive-in's and Dive's on the Food Network and they do a feature on this place.  Go on and on about the waffles.  So the next morning, we head over.  Walk up to the building and people everywhere just standing around.  So I walk in side and was stopped by a server and told to step outside.  She handed me a clipboard and walked back in.  Apparently, I was suppose to put my own name down on the list to be seated, so I did.  We waited almost and hour.  We were finally called to head in.  Walk in and can't believe how tiny this place is...they sit the three of us down at a table made for one so we're all fighting over elbow space.  Look over the menu and decide to order a waffle, eggs and OJ.  Server tells me the waffle iron is broken.  That was the only reason I came here because of the so called world famous waffles.  So I settle for pancakes, eggs and OJ.  They bring out my teaspoon of OJ.  Seriously I have never had such a small glass of OJ.  The food finally arrives, and to tell you the truth, it was good but not worth the hour of my life I spent standing outside waiting.  I'll stick to IHOP.	7	6	4	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Zo-tRHfaanb4wXknzzISmw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
AYyiy2kLjCRrp8PSLozMGg	4	2011-05-05 00:00:00	I definitely would have to give Matts a 4 stars max, could not give it a 5 stars because I do believe they are of a five star quality but lack any originality as say a Liberty Market. \n\nHave heard a ton about Matts and I do have to say that they have quality food, Went there and had waffles with bacon and a side order of potatoes. They do make basic food very well and that is a good but it is basic food. Nothing imaginative or out of the ordinary, so nothing to really to say WOW that is something new. Again though they do basic food very well which is harder said then done, and that is why I would recommend it, I would not go out of my way though just because of the location and the size of the place, but I only judge by food. If you can get in the food is very good even great.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	qu4Dvea1o8epTwbU_2ZfFw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

But, the eggs with salami were really yummy and salty. The hash browns and home fires were awesome! Some of the best I'd ever had.  The toast was delicious and came with (I think homemade) blackberry preserves. So good!  And my coffee and water glass was never empty.  \n\nWe went on a weekday at 7:30 and there was no wait.	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	40jyU6WuoTpYPkg8tPClXg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I got this with white toast and their delicious home fries (they're the best I have ever had). \n\nIt's too bad Matt's doesn't open more locations around the valley.

B7iqZOZPqLeN7qnCKJQ4Hw	4	2012-07-09 00:00:00	I really enjoyed this place when I went a few weeks ago.  I hear that there is usually a long wait to get in, when I went I was lucky enough to only wait about 5 minutes before there was a table ready for us, but then again I went at 11 am on a Tuesday so I think that helped a bit.  \n\nI went on the advice of a family member.  What I wish had been mentioned was the process of how you put your name in for a table.  There is a notebook outside the front door where you write your name and the number of people in your party on.  \n\nThe coffee i had was AMAZING, and it set high expectations for the meal which were definitely met.  I had a special for that day (egg scramble with artichoke chicken sausage and gruyere cheese I believe) with sourdough toast and a side of the homefries.  I would eat this meal again in a heartbeat.  Everything was incredibly fresh down to the homemade strawberry jam.  \n\nThis is a place I definitely want to go back to.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	w7ivcXcJYWOQ3Icq1xLBxQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

bd5-850LZRCJMhVrHcREMg	4	2008-12-11 00:00:00	I've lived downtown for 5 years now and never heard of this place until I saw it on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives'...\n\nJust kidding. I'm a semi-regular. I say "semi" because I go in series. I'll go four or five times in a two week period and then have to lay off and hit the gym to work off the 20 pounds I gained. But I keep going back.\n\nMatt uses a lot of butter when he cooks, which makes everything taste better. The fresh made pancakes and waffles are awesome with real maple syrup. The pork chop and eggs is a delightfully dangerous breakfast, marinated in a homemade pesto sauce (the porkchop, that is - who marinates eggs?). The thick cut bacon strips are great for breakfast and even better in the BLT (which I sometimes order with a fried egg on it for breakfast, a BELT).\n\nIt looks as though most people are saying this is a '$' place but I would give it '$$'. I have yet to leave there with a bill under $10.\n\nSome complain about the wait but I have and answer for that - don't go if you're in a hurry. If you go on a weekend, bring an iPod or something to read while you're waiting.	9	7	5	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	28kYhdXFg4j0T-VzJ_iToQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
bDBz--4DLE4KEqJSJnOPIw	4	2009-05-17 00:00:00	There were a couple of reviews for Matt's Big Breakfast that didn't make a whole lot of sense to me.  Two people made the comment that "Denny's makes a better breakfast".  That is patently ridiculous.  The only time someone cracks open an egg at Denny's is if you order them sunny side up.  Otherwise, they pour pre-scrambled eggs (as does IHOP) from a bottle.  The other comments I've read are "there's nothing here that can't be made at home."  Completely true, but that could be said of a lot of restaurants.  The whole point is going OUT to eat when you don't want to make food at home.  Frankly, some of the lesser starred reviews would be much different if not for the long waits.  Anyway, I digress...\n\nLike many, I first became aware of MBB after it was featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins and Dives (DDD, Triple D, 3D, etc.)  It looked good, but nothing terribly special.  Certainly not like some of the places I've seen on DDD, which leave me checking travel websites for flights.  But, I thought, "If I'm in Phoenix, I'll give this a try."  \n\nSo, I'm in Phoenix and craving breakfast.  I make my way down to Matt's and while there are 6-7 people milling about outside, it's not too bad.  After waiting maybe 30 minutes (downright speedy compared to the wait endured by some other reviewers), my name is called and I enter the tiny eatery.  The menu is pretty sparse, but there are some specials so I opted for one of the items on the chalkboard: egg, spinach, mushroom, smoked gouda scramble with hash browns and toast.  While I wait for my meal, I enjoy some of the very tasty coffee.  My plate arrives, and it is a large serving of food, contradicting the reports of skimpy servings.  As a lover of hash browns, I had to try them first.  Crispy and super buttery, just as I recalled when watching DDD.  The scramble was excellent and you could tell how fresh the ingredients are.  I decided to save my toast and housemade jam as my "dessert", so to speak.  I think my only issue was with the hash browns.  They started off so well, but it was a large portion and at the halfway point the richness of the butter started taking its toll.  I soldiered on and finished my plate, but I seriously thought I'd have a heart attack.  Sadly, did not have room for my toast and jam.\n\nIf I ever find myself in Phoenix again, I would come back.	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	dR9OiTIjuzvDdoqjuulKrw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Saw it on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and it still impressed.\n\nGot the prime flank steak with over easy eggs, sourdough, hashbrowns, and coffee.\n\nFlank steak was fat, juicy, and had a great pink to it. Kind of tough crust but definately impressive for a breakfast place. Eggs were good and cooked good too. Homeade blueberry preserves were amazing and I put them on everything. Bread was nice but the best was the hashbrowns. Best hashbrowns I have had to date. Crispy outside but so soft and buttery inside. Flawless texture and flavor. You MUST try these, you won't regret it. Waiter said to try cheddar cheese on them the next time and I will definately be back and can't wait to try it. \n\nDefinately best breakfast and you have to go here if your in the area.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	WYUQyka1DynzfB9foEQCpA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
bEV-SqZUhe58CJvEcjCOTw	4	2012-01-27 00:00:00	"What is this? A restaurant for ants? I don't want to hear any excuses! The building has to be at least... Three times bigger than this!"\n\nOn a more serious note, this is a teeny, tiny restaurant - so small that the first action of order is to write your name on a notepad that is waiting on a small table outside the entrance. Then expect to wait outside until there is space inside, because there is simply no space to stand and wait inside. But when you do manage to stick a foot in the door, Matt's Big Breakfast invites you in to a cheery, diner-esque environment but with fresh flowers on the table and nicer than average cutlery to boot. Like the establishment, the menu is small. We ordered the Salami Scramble and the Chop & Chick.\n\nSALAMI SCRAMBLE\nThough I can always appreciate a bacon and eggs type breakfast, the peppery punch of the salami scramble was a nice change from the classic. Of course breakfast isn't breakfast without some made-from-scratch hash browns that were crispy but not too oily. I generally like my browns a little less fried, but I still enjoyed these taters nonetheless.\n\nCHOP & CHICK\nThe pork chop was expertly seasoned which was right up my alley, because huge hunks of just meat just doesn't hit the spot. Huge hunks of meat with lots o' spices though? Oh yes.\n\nAll in all, a nice experience at this charming little restaurant. I would definitely visit when I want some good ol' meat and potatoes for breakfast.	3	6	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	1llynOxa9WgVxibZTsxZHw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Being the norcal gal I am I called and asked if the line was hella long... the gal on the phone mentioned that around 12:30-1pm the line calms down. We got there and were seated immediately. Bonus points for having ice cold water outside too. This place was perfect for recovering after the previous nights drink fest. I had the Five Spot with hash browns and it was amazing.

And though my time in Phoenix is always limited, that hour and a half wait for a table is worth the wait every single time.\n\nIf you're here for breakfast, order the special. You will never be disappointed. It's usually some sort of scramble, with fresh local ingredients. The potatoes with rosemary always hits the spot. Do yourself a favor and get the LARGE freshly squeezed orange juice. The small is a tiny little thing, and if you're gonna spend the money, spend the extra buck and get more.\n\nMy favorite lunch item is the Rueben. BEST RUEBEN EVER. And I've had my share of reubens. This sandwich is magic in your mouth. The last time I had one, I decided that I also wanted breakfast, so I had them add an over-easy egg in the sandwich. That was heaven in my mouth---- I still dream of that particular sandwich.\n\nA majority of the items on the menu are made with local ingredients (jam, bread, and coffee included). The service is ALWAYS fast and friendly. And as tiny as the place is, they turn tables quickly and keep everything immaculately clean.\n\nI love Matts. Best breakfast in the entire state of Arizona.

However, the fact that there IS a line should tell you that this place is pretty stellar.  Because I'm a creature of habit, I don't normally order anything besides the special or the hog and chick.  You really can't go wrong with either.  Every dish is made with high quality ingredients.  I always rave to my friends about how the spinach in the special was the most spinachy spinach I've ever tasted (that's a good thing).  Thick slices of peppery bacon = party in my mouth.  Their caramelized onions tossed with perfectly crispy on the outside but soft on the inside potatoes are also a different yet equally awesome party in my mouth.  What gets me every time is their thick slice of toast and organic preserves.  SO GOOD.  And a coffee mug that's never empty, that's always a plus too.  Matt, I don't know who you are but your breakfasts are delightful.	2	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	AyCmU_AJSBVRjQs9qnucig	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

However, we just walked around a little bit and explored the area, and pleasantly, there was no pressure by the servers to turn over tables once we were seated. The venue itself is small, but beautiful. The windows were large and filled with natural light making it seem open and spacious.\n\nThe food was also really good. While the salami scramble didn't particularly suit my taste, they had crispy hashbrowns and freshly made cherry jam to go with the toast-- both were above and beyond. I'll definitely be back next time in town.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	s8OAEU13DRLlsfaT0eIAew	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

BS8EsXEr6WF5I1bJiBpOBw	3	2009-08-02 00:00:00	I was disappointed too.  I waited an hour and then took at seat at the counter which is ok with me, but if you've got long legs your only option is to sit spread-eagled in order to get close enough to your plate and there's not that much legroom to each side.  In the small space in front of the counter the staff was in perpetual motion squeezing past each other to get drinks, etc.   My cheddar, jalepeno, sausage omelette was very good, but not huge, and the hash browns were crisp and tasty on the outside but soggy on the inside.  The whole wheat toast was great, but no choice of toppings...I was given a small dollop of peach preserves. \nThe waffles next to me looked fabulous, but I'm not a fan.   Basically I didn't think it wasn't worth the hour wait in 100 degrees and I was relieved to get outside where there was some breathing room.	2	2	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	sc5xvPjAOddvAn96GIYVZA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

By the sight of the long line outside the restaurant at 1230, I had big hopes for this place! We sat down and were greeted with water from a waitress who was dressed for the gym or a booty dance in her too short too tight too small shorts. \n\nThe meal-\n1) breakfast sandwich. Very tasty! The peppered bacon made the dish.\n2) famous has browns- crispy outside but the inside was a mushy mash consistency\n3) griddle cakes- fluffy and light, but nothing to write home about. \n\nService- we asked one of the waiters for an extra plate to share. He brought one with dried omelet residue on, put it on our table, saw the same leftover meal we saw, then proceeded to scrap it off with his nail, then put it back on our table. I didn't know what to do but laugh at the awkward experience, at which the same waiter rushed back and asked if that plate was okay. Oh boy...\n\nOverall good but wouldn't wait again for it	0	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	khYx7FUZPQ061E-x5S7q3w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

bXWSJHV6Jdv70JMheghHLw	4	2012-11-25 00:00:00	Matt's Big Breakfast is the real deal - celebrating tons of local ingredients and making everything from scratch. But the wait can be killer.\n\nWe were a party of three going to Matt's about noon on a Sunday. I had heard about the wait, but the hour we sat there was still pretty rough. Once we were seated, though, the service was fast and friendly.\n\nOur friend (who's a local) told us the best thing on the menu was The Hog & Chick, so that's what all of us ordered. I was totally pleased with everything:\n\n* Coffee - from a local roaster\n* OJ - freshly squeezed (in a teeny tiny glass)\n* Eggs - fresh and local\n* Potatoes - buttery, herbed, and delicious\n* Toast - thick, buttery, and delicious\n* Preserves - homemade at Matt's and super delish\n* ham - a giant slab of serious goodness\n\nThe price was very reasonable too - especially for the quality of food. For all the items listed above, I paid about $15. Next time I'm in the area, I'll totally go back to Matt's, but I'll try to pick an obscure time when the wait isn't quite so bad.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	wSByVbwME4MzgkJaFyfvNg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I don't have anything against Matt - I love the Roosevelt and visit there fairly often - I just don't see the point in waiting, in the sun, for breakfast - when it's not that special and if you have to walk into the hotel next door to use the restroom.  I am looking forward to some competition.	2	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Mq8Su0PZC8D4EaJrLJOhYw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
C2vIBc7Ci1ewgPg7swqO3w	5	2012-12-28 00:00:00	What do they do to make a basic breakfast so good? Well, actually mine wasn't basic. I took the special off the board: Andouille sausage, havarti cheese (I think), a lovely red spicy pepper three egg omelette AH-mazing, their famous potatoes on the side. Thick slices of whole grain bread on the side with a tiny bit of butter (I wish it had more). One of my kids had the breakfast sandwich with bacon, one had the chicken marinated in pesto sandwich, and the husband had something I can't remember but everyone was very full, very happy even after waiting well over an hour to get seated.  We did ask for a grilled cheese sandwich for our kid and the waitress looked at us stunned and said it's not on the menu. True but they have bread and cheese right? Oh well. What I loved more than anything was every staff person you come in contact with says: Thank you for waiting! \n\nI hope to go back soon even though it's a 40 minute drive from my house and more than likely an hour wait to get in - it's worth it.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	iylyMoq92gzB8RYMfO2NmQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
cctpw2poexgKBsez7SK3zQ	3	2008-03-20 00:00:00	Maybe I'm biased because I can make a damn tasty breakfast myself at home, but for all the rave reviews and even being on TV, I expected this place to be a little above average.\n\nDecent food, awesome waitstaff.  Let's weigh the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n*good tasty bacon...\n*hashbrowns to die for - crunchy on the outside, creamy inside...\n*definite use of fresh ingredients...\n\nCons:\n*it felt like eating in my pantry with 25 other people...\n*all the cooks get to hear you peeing in the water closet (and I mean closet)...(maybe this is a problem only for the female persuasion?)...\n*almost $2 for a CAN of RC that probably cost them 25 cents, no free refills...\n*one egg was undercooked and one was overcooked...\n*feeling rushed to finish and get out of there as people outside stare at you wondering why you're taking so long to eat...\n\nOh and not to mention the butter burger that was ordered with blue maytag that I had to try a bite of - and ended up with a couple of tablespoons of hot boiling butter in my lap.  The maytag was yummy and fortunately I could taste it despite my scorched tongue.\n\nWe definitely left with full tummies (including my red burnt one) but more cons than pros means it was worth it to try for the first time, but I think the only item I might crave is the hashbrowns.  If I ever REALLY have to have their hashbrowns, I'll order it to go!	3	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Q9NlyapDA97_NA0qaq8w0A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
CCwCX3WZmyy5ZpFzW7vCcQ	3	2012-09-16 00:00:00	This is the type of restaurant you only go to once.\nI have now been there twice - once at the old location, once at the new one.\nThe reason you only go there once?\n\nHOLY WAIT TIME, batman.\n\nI'm sorry, but there has to be a way to make the seating more efficient.  When you're hungry, there's nothing worse than 30-60 minute wait times, or a giant party of 15 people who arrive later than you do and they get to "squeeze in". Although Matt's has just upgraded to a new, bigger space, this still isn't the type of restaurant that should be accommodating 15-person groups (AKA almost the entire dining area).\n\nWe went here for my husband's birthday on a Friday morning. After waiting about 45 minutes, we were next on the list but got bumped to the uncomfortable street-facing counter seats, when at that very moment there were three empty two-top tables, completely set with silverware and everything. We asked if we could be seated there instead, but were turned down by the host, because they were being reserved for the aforementioned party. My husband was having trouble with knee pain that morning and the counter seats did not physically accommodate his needs, so we asked our waitress if there was anywhere else we could sit. Again, we were turned down. I was getting a little flustered, not the way you want to feel on your loved one's birthday. We considered leaving, even after we ordered our food. Eventually, they did allow us to sit at a two-top, which I appreciated.\n\nThe food was the only redeeming quality, but again I was too flustered to truly enjoy it. I got the cheese omelette with hash browns. Very good, although hash browns were a greasy, mushy mess. My husband got a ham scramble of some kind. We had a side of rye toast, which was tasty. Beverages were served in cute little jam jars.\n\nPROS:\nFood, Decor, Charm, Ambience, Supporting a local endeavor\n\nCONS:\nThe most hyper-inflated wait time and some of the worst seating options of any restaurant I've ever known.\n\nThe take-out option sounds nice, and would eliminate a lot of my frustrations.	1	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	kPaqBMv4mU-N80Fzd8vU3A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I recently went to breakfast there and order a cheese omelet with home fries and wnet away hungry and very disappointed.  The home fries were mostly uncooked and badly seasoned,  The eggs were hard and disappointing and the toast was hard and cold.  This was very unsatisfactory and it is certain that Matt's Breakfast lives off its laurels and not the food.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	xUrUxVNOfP7fztWPDXHbyA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Had the Salami Scramble which was DELICIOUS! The side of hashbrowns were AMAZING (maybe the best part of the meal) and I was pleasantly surprised the side of toast was a legit piece of bread, like something you would find at a bakery, and not just a slice of bread you could buy at the market. Eggs were fresh and light and the salami was perfection. \n\nOnly downside was that they made us wait outside for our table which was a little ridiculous considering it was 115 degrees outside. But I got nothing bad to say about their food.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	xydxp4ccdwtdBfim8DFGdw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

CsmGrMZImrlkRo1ioznKxg	5	2008-06-09 00:00:00	Please, people! For the love of God, stay home! Do not come to Matt's Big Breakfast.\n\nYou will not enjoy the crispy, fresh hash browns. You would not like the weekend specials, such as huevos rancheros with fresh salsa, or scrambles made with seasonal, organic ingredients. A cheese and mushroom omelette will not appeal to you. They do not serve delicious Wildflower Bread toasted with most entrees. The coffee will not be piping hot and the iced tea will certainly not be tasty and delightful.\n\nAnd whatever you do, please do not order one of the waffles made from scratch. They come dusted with powdered sugar, served with warm syrup and a big scoop of butter. You probably wouldn't like it.\n\nIf, for some unknown reason, you found yourself at Matt's for lunch, you would not enjoy the Butter Burger. It would not be served on a delicious roll and topped with gooey melty cheese and a thick slice of tomato. No it wouldn't. The macaroni salad is not an excellent substitute for the kettle chips that normally accompany said Burger.\n\nFor the last time, please stay away. May I recommend you get your breakfast on at the perfectly adequate U.S-Egg-Good-Peep, or First Watch? The lines at Matt's are long enough as it is, and the regulars are getting cranky about it.	9	17	11	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	AomCKd1tTI6qA70YckRwag	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Though breakfast is busy, it is worth the outside wait even in the middle of the summer.  The wait staff is great and always on their toes, it is fun to see the owner's wife active in the restaurant filling coffee, delivering food and following up on your experience.  Though the menu is not too long, it has all the classic greats, plus great specials.

CVqUK55oM4lw5P_mbXBQvg	5	2009-10-13 00:00:00	So it begins....I have finally started reviewing all the restaurants that I tried on my tour of the Southwest this summer and Matt's Big Breakfast was a BIG way to start it off!\n\nBeing from LA which seems to be the home of trendy but good and always crowded breakfast spots, I understand the love/hate relationship that people have with their local breakfast spot that have just become way to crowded.  That being said, I left LA to try some of the favorites in other cities.  The good thing about being on vacation is that you can schedule your meals around the crowds instead of dealing with them.\n\nSo we drove into Phoenix around 11pm under the blanket of the night which was great because the days were reaching 120 degrees.  It was quieter then most cities, almost ghost-town like.  We stayed at the motel next to Matt's Big Breakfast.  I think its called the Coronado or Casablanca Hotel.  It was more of a Motel then Hotel and definitely not the Holiday Inn.  Although a little on the scary side it served its purpose.  The goal was to wake up and walk into Matt's.  And that goal was certainly achieved.  \n\nAfter a super long wait of about...3 minutes (9:30am) we sat down and took a look at the menu.  \n\nhttp://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1410-1.jpg\n\nIt wasnt as big as I thought it was going to be (haha)...well, it wasnt as expansive as I thought it was going to be but I would rather restaurants do what they do right instead of tons of things done wrong.\n\nI got the Hog & Chick and Griddle Cakes.  Thick cut bacon and perfectly made eggs with delicious potatoes.  Nice thick bread and homemade jam came along side.  Im not a fan of citrus jams/preserves but this was fantastic!\n\nhttp://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1415.jpg\n\nhttp://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y143/skptk13/DSCF1417.jpg\n\nThe pancakes were possibly the best of the trip and also some of the best I have ever had.  Everything we had was great!   Our server/owner  even came and talked to us about our trip, the town and even gave us some other suggestions on places to see and eat at while in Phoenix.  I wish I could have tried some of the places she suggested but...alas, we still had a ton of places still on our own list.  \n\nOff to Joe's Farm Grill!!!	2	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Ez5XvlmwbZaUaKf8lp6fUw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

They definitely do not skimp on the good stuff!  I was talking about it with a guy at The Roosevelt later that night and he told me Matt drives out to Gilbert once a week for that bacon.  Definitely worth it!  The hash browns are even better.  Perfectly crispy without being burned.  Matt's will definitely fill you up at a very good price.

Somehow, I remembered that I needed to arrive around 8am if I would get a seat and parking and not starve at the door.  We walked right in!\n\nThis intimate kitchen setting stashed in the middle of downtown nowhere really is the BIG attraction in the area.  Wholesomely good with organic everything and home grown and home made this and that, I found myself ooohing and aaaahing before even opening my mouth to sample the tea and grapefruit juice!  EVERYONE's food seem to lure me in and I actually had a VERY hard time selecting just one item that I wanted for breakfast.\n\nThe menu is not big. But my eyes were as a re-contemplated the implications of not getting one item or selecting another option over another.  I landed somehow on the omelette!  Original n'est pas?\nI enjoyed everything about it.  Kristy got the pancakes and coffee and is still talking about how this was the next best thing to do if  you were denied a promised road trip by a hungover friend to Sedona!	3	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	jlpapIPWURjBUg3V31AjKw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

We went on a Sunday morning, so I expected a long wait (I even brought a book).\nThere was about an hour wait ahead of us, so I was already happy it wasn't longer than that.\nThe exterior is cute. I was already giving the place a point on style alone and because the interior is oh-so tiny! \nThey had some retro looking fans going-we ended up sitting in the rear room.\nI had the eggs and sausage, with wheat toast. Meh. I wasn't crazy about the food. The prices were very reasonable though.\nMy toast was way too thick, and was more a multi-grain than a wheat (hey I know the difference). I like thin, crunchy toast, not giant slabs of semi toasted bread.\nThere is no bathroom-you have to go next door to the creepy motel to use the bathroom which is in a room .Did I mention creepy? it's super creepy.\nBack to the food. I didn't notice any size selections for the juices. I had an orange juice. It was freshly squeezed and very tasty, but oh so tiny. I could have finished it in a gulp.\nNo one read us any specials, though I did hear the people next to us were read the specials (hey maybe I wanted the steak and eggs?! At least gimme the option. hmmph).\nThe service was hurried, but not rude. Our drinks were never refreshed.. so I was licking the pulp out of my cup by my 3rd bite.\nMy husband had the belgian waffle. Again, Meh. Nothing special.\nThere was really nothing special here that would make me come back, the wait alone, though not as long as I expected, will keep me away.	2	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	dJP1RDSrtDnSDCM2i23Wow	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Staff was very helpful considering my family put them through their paces ( not taking them again - they don't deserve it).	1	2	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	5dBgiiH_smly6bKMDrM79w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
DAvtX4ZYbxZJiqYMiyISTw	5	2009-08-15 00:00:00	Hi all! Went to Matt's last night for the PJ's and Eggs! Matt was great a bunch of the guys from Hickman farms were there having breakfast too! The special was steak and eggs, while I originally had my little heart set on a butter burger I had to try the Steak and eggs. I was not disappointed it was fantastic! Just as I suspected. I think I am becoming a Matt's groupie! lol. I can't help it between the cozy atmosphere, the friendly staff, fresh delicious menu choices and given that I am supporting a family business I am hooked! Now I will say last night we waited about an hour and there were 5 of us but all agreed it was so worth the wait. PS I had to get a butter burger to go I had it for lunch today YUM! Thanks Erenia and Matt!	4	2	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	THXdIY73jWmzYNrYPp-dIw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I don't mind paying for large portions or something super good but $7.50 for a couple pancakes is too much for my retired wallet.	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	DtOZkUVhQRPp8-oJ7updeg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
DbkvPJHLM7opZkhTFnkOKg	5	2009-07-16 00:00:00	I'm a huge fan of matts. Have been for 2 years now. Their service is great, but more importantly their food is amazing. Always order teh home fries. My favorites are the hog and chick and the big butter burger. The only slight downfall is the wait, if it looks like there are 25 people in front of you on the list, it might be best to just go another time.  Unless you're willing to wait more than two hours.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	mgDZezplapd4OpoCPHX5Ug	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
dBnsPGcr4vQWhAv_a7yk1Q	5	2007-12-31 00:00:00	First off I LOVE this place! I have never been disappointed with the food or service. If you love breakfast food this is your place. You have to try the Salami Scramble with home fries (which are the best damn potatoes this side of Idaho). \nAlso, if you're lucky the special of the day might be the eggs benedict that are making me hungry just thinking about them.\n\nIf you get there around 11:00 am be prepared to wait but they will seat you pretty fast. The customer service is great and the prices are cheap! Don't come here if you want a healthy breakfast because it won't be but it will be some of the best breakfast food you will ever have!	4	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	dLpB2Em0GstZy6LjFiFwBw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
DE3c-KQwT2tkcPqbSIVr7Q	5	2009-11-22 00:00:00	Since breakfast isn't my favorite meal to eat out (I like to eat as soon as I get up...breakfast is yummy just rolled out of bed), I had not tried, but  only been hearing raves about Matt's Big Breakfast for literally about a year, so I knew it had to be good...good enough to try breaking my fast outside my own kitchen.\n\nLuckily it wasn't too crowded (as I'd heard it might be).  We were seated at a window counter, but then moved once our food came to a little table by the door.  The staff was ultimately accommodating to the best experience for us. \n\nThe food was beyond delicious.  Egg salad sandwich with chips (I told you I wasn't a huge breakfast-out person), a waffle, and potatoes, and chocolate milk.  It was all SO delicious!  And SO MUCH!  We were able to take most of the sandwich home for later.  By the way, the break was AMAZING...just amazing.\n\nMy favorite thing I think (besides the food) was how friendly everyone was--from the staff to the customers.  It also was cool because since Matt's is small (but not too small), you wind up talking to the people around you.  Three tables joined in our conversation to complain about State Senator Russel Pearce, who led the slaughter of AZ's education budgets particularly in Spring 2009...but that's a different story...\n\nI need to go back to Matt's soon--it was a great time.	4	2	4	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	VePQan21Rmiw_xNo_kzsAg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
DFaiENmmCr3GZR70B8J30A	3	2011-02-01 00:00:00	After hearing all of the hype on diners, drive in and dives and reading the yelp ratings, we decided to try it.  We waited over 30 minutes  for a table.  The place is small and outside of a dungy motel.  The service was extremely fast once you got in the door and the waitstaff are very friendly.  I had a waffle and it was good but nothing memorable.  My partner had an omelette with portguese sausage that he loved.  The hash browns were so buttery and they were good.  \n\nI wouldn't make a special trip back.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	kBZRjaN04_55lMx3F4_oZQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
DGnmheIT7SWVolsJ8HuvVw	5	2011-01-29 00:00:00	I love this place. We've been going every Saturday for the past few months, and although there is always at least an hour wait on Saturdays the awesome food and cute cozy atmosphere has been worth it. This is definitely a gem in the heart of downtown Phoenix, I personally love the Hog and Chick which is two eggs cooked to order, three big strips of peppered bacon, your choice of hash browns or home fries and your choice of fresh baked toasted bread on the side served up with preserves from a local source. Their honey lemonade is inspired and their iced coffee is pretty good too. \n\nThey are right across the street from the Phoenix Public Market and if you want to go walk around and see the shops instead of waiting outside (for an hour) you can write 'market' by your name and you will be seated next up if you get back after you've been called. My daughter always orders the waffles and devours them and her dad keeps 'waffling' between the pancakes and the waffles but always cleans his plate (and usually some of mine as well!) the hostess is very cheery and efficient, she calls us 'Team Justin' and she always checks in with us at least once or twice during our meal.\n\nI'd definitely check this place out if you've never been, they used to be closed on Monday's but very recently that's changed and I've been told that if you want to get in WITHOUT the wait, Monday is the time to go! Happy Eating from Team Justin!	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	T7dYjXf7I9sR5P9U9xtd6w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I first read about Matt's in an America West in-flight magazine and put it on my list of places to go.\n\nYou know the wait was about 20 minutes, the staff was quick and the food was good. I would say the biggest appeal about Matt's is that it seems like the food is reliable, you go there for breakfast and guess what you get it straight up.\n\nWhat I most appreciate, is that Matt saw potential in an old downtown building and is doing his part to bring business to that part of town.	4	0	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	_4iFWWuZ6_RrzyXZrMq3Mw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
DhfcsxUzoeMH_rprblF0Rw	3	2012-10-02 00:00:00	What am I missing here?  I have heard about Matt's since moving to Phoenix almost 5 years ago, but never wanted to wait outside in the heat to try it.  Now that they have moved into a bigger building, I figured I could try it.  The space is cute -- kind of a minimalist industrial theme.  I was not AT ALL impressed with the menu.  Not much to choose from, and you'll end up having to order items a la carte if you want variety in your meal (e.g., I didn't see any meals that included pancakes, a side of breakfast meat and eggs -- in fact, the pancakes don't even include a side of breakfast meat, so you have to order that a la carte).\n\nI ordered the waffle, which does come with a side of bacon, and an orange juice.  The orange juice, although fresh-squeezed and very good, had to be the smallest glass of OJ I have ever seen. It was basically a large shot glass.  At $2.50 a glass, I felt a little jilted.  The waffle was really good!  It was definitely fresh and buttery.  The bacon left a lot to be desired.  It was pretty fatty, and the pepper crust really didn't add anything to the flavor. \n\nMaybe my expectations were too high based on all of the rave reviews I have heard about Matt's, but my experience was just okay.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	an-ijVpGQxgiOBX9qTBOyQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
dIMsYxwQdLGssG07UYdkVQ	3	2013-01-17 00:00:00	Matt's was my favorite breakfast place ever but now I have to add a caveat.  Do not go to Matt's during a busy if you want to hear anything the waitress or anyone that is with you.  The food is still fabulous and it is great that you do not need to wait long but the noise level is a constant roar of voices.  Even if I was alone it is uncomfortably noisy.  I would not go there again for breakfast until at least after 9 AM .  Maybe it gets busy again for the lunch crowd but I have never been there  after 10:30AM	0	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ki_YKul9tGyuZ0DTao77MQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Dtr1DOFhM09UgxzlYz-ahg	4	2012-10-15 00:00:00	Went to Matt's after checking on Yelp when we landed at Phoenix airport.  It seemed like a nice place to eat based on the reviews.\nThe restaurant is very small and located on an unassuming street corner just south of downtown.  Free parking is difficult to find so bring change for parking meters that are in abundance.  We arrived at around 9 in the morning and it was already warm, and yes there is a wait outside.  There is also not much shade other than a couple of umbrellas and the overhang.  I can't imagine really long waits.  By the way, don't go inside to sign up.  You put your name on a note pad outside of the door and they'll come out to get you when it is your turn.  Our wait on an off-day was about 15-20 minutes.  (Update:  Looks like they have moved).\n\nThe room for us inside was counter-seating next to the register.  It was a tad bit cramped and we didn't have a lot of space to wiggle since we were dealing with servers passing by us constantly.  The service was attentive and pleasant.  All the servers seemed like they were college co-eds but they did not lack any kind of customer service quality.  They buzzed around with purpose and had no problems with menus, rude customers, or getting around the cramped quarters of the establishment.  \n\nThe food is excellent.  We shared a three egg omelet with chicken apple sausage and local hot peppers that was one of the best I've tasted.  The pancakes were fluffy and delicious, and the side of pepper bacon complemented everything perfectly.  The star of the meal is the home fries; an amalgamation of potatoes, buttery goodness, and rosemary.  They are scrumptious beyond belief.  \n\nOverall the experience at Matt's was excellent, and maybe the new building will allow for better parking and less wait time.  And while the food was outstanding, the conditions for waiting, the parking, and the cramped spaces inside only warrant 4 stars.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	BFzyuOd7y3R6QTFZgRereg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

If you're only going to eat out breakfast a few times a month, this is the spot. \n\nDon't be fooled by other Phoenix Yelp haters..."too loud", "not worth the price", "I want to love this place, but...", same old tired reviews left at all of PHX's favorite restaurants. Check this place out, grab a coffee while you wait, and hope the Matt wants to expand the operation.	0	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	K5X5meD4V_9PrPLRooEYUw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

All their ingredients are local, organic, and farm raised. Their bacon is something I always tell people to try. Its insanely thick and peppered to perfection! I would go there just for a side of bacon! Their toast is thick and baked fresh. Even their OJ is fresh squeezed.

DwdRbeg0I2_xtSzWqtVykA	4	2012-07-05 00:00:00	Matt's Big Breakfast is a nice, quaint little breakfast joint that does breakfast very well. A friend and I came here this morning and we were very much pleased with the food, the atmosphere, and the service.\n\nWe both ordered the day's special. It was a apple sausage scramble with spinach, a helping of hash browns, and some toast. Everything about the dish was very well done. The eggs were scrambled just right so that they were buttery, a lil creamy, and very fluffy. The apple sausage was just alright. It wasn't bursting with flavor and could've used a lil more heat or smokiness or something. \n\nThe hash browns are worth raving about though. The top layer of hash browns were crazy crispy which is always a good thing. But beneath the crust were some great gooey gluey but not soggy potatoes that perfectly complimented the crisp of the outside. The crisp:gooey ratio was flawless!\n\nEven the toast was fantastic. Went with sourdough. Always do and forever will. The jam was made with fresh berries. The toast was thick and well-buttered. Went great with the freshly made jam.\n\nAll-in-all it was a good breakfast experience. It wasn't the best breakfast in the world. It wasn't super phenomenal or mind-blowing. But it was certainly above average so I'll give it 4 stars.	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	YwAbuujxLASmH4jn6iZBYQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

E-qRur7Z4HbyEcI-bM9wsQ	4	2009-03-21 00:00:00	Thanks to Guy Fieri of FoodNetwork fame, this place was at the top of my list for a weekend getaway to Phoenix/Scottsdale! My friend and I drove directly from the airport to Matt's, which turned out to be in a rather desolate location but easy enough to find. Our timing was just right because we arrived a little before noon and were seated within minutes.\n\nSince I'd been up since dawn and not had a proper meal, I went all out and ordered the Hog and the Chick (choice of pork product with eggs), plus a side of the pancakes! It was all fantastic--just wish I could have finished it. The bacon was tasty and the griddlecakes were amazing! They had this wonderful texture, substantial but still light, tasted of corn, and stood up to the syrup. I hate when pancakes go all soggy with syrup, but these didn't. They just stayed delicious to the last bite. Yum!\n\nWill definitely go back if I'm ever in Phoenix again.	3	2	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	BI43zsVnKZHtMI_4GBStng	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

e3KdeINjg8oMZ4dyBD1H8g	3	2012-06-19 00:00:00	Perhaps if I waited outside in the heat for an hour plus to the point that I became starved and dehydrated, I too would have thought Matt's was worthy of 5 stars. Or maybe the 5 star reviews come from people too ashamed to admit that they wasted most of their morning on a very average breakfast.\n\nIn my case, we came here before 7am on a Friday and got the last available seats by the window. Service was great; I didn't detect any attitudes from the waitstaff that has been mentioned in some reviews. They got our meal out quickly and made sure our coffee mugs never got empty.\n\nWith the exception of the toast and jam, the food never rose above "good." Isn't that pretty sad that the best offering from a breakfast diner is the bread? I liked my waffle since it was a bit crisper than what I can do at home with my geriatric waffle iron, but there was nothing noteworthy about the flavor. My husband said his eggs were cooked perfectly with his chop and chick dish, but the pork chop was under-seasoned. He found the hashbrowns way too greasy to be enjoyable, and the bacon suffered from being overcooked.\n\nMaybe we're spoiled since we have two great breakfast places within walking distance (Joe's Farm Grill and the Coffee Shop). Matt's just isn't worth the drive or wait.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	pu_AQig2fw40PshvtgONPQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Anyone who has eaten at Bryan's in San Diego would know what I mean.	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	BFTxzvXftqqBFgfry1kBgw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

They specialize in fresh pork products. I had the homemade country sausage and eggs. My son had the pork chop and eggs.  Both were very tasty.  We also split an order of griddle cakes.  They were light and fluffy. Overall, a great breakfast establishment, but plan on waiting. I can only imagine how long the wait is on weekends.

I live in Tucson and my family is mostly in the east  valley of Phoenix and I have been waiting for 2 years to go into downtown and eat at Matt's. I go and put my name on the waiting list. Other parties of 2 come after me and the guy kept sitting people that had been there for 20-30 minutes and I had been waiting exactly 1 hour. What really upset me is that I saw him seat 3 people at tables for 2 and when I walked in said he couldn't sit 3 there when there were others seated that way (i think he knew them).  I am truly disappointed as I've been waiting like I said for "2" years to eat there. If you have a party of more than 2, like a mere 3, you'll wait forever!	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	X89SPyEHgGgxK-0RIpa8lA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Guy Fieri knows good food so this was the first place I thought of when my parents wanted to grab breakfast in Phoenix. Luckily, on a Monday afternoon, we avoided the rush, and only waited 5 minutes! Score! Now on to the grub.\n\nA lot of the food here is locally grown, they use cage-free eggs, and they even make their own jam/preservatives. I loved everything we ordered. Pancakes were different- they are very sweet- no need for any syrup. The hash browns were very good, but very heavy- and a bit soggy (which I actually prefer). The toast is large, freshly baked, and served with real butter. (nothing beats real butter!) My pork chop was very tasty and seasoned just right. Also, our server was a sweetheart, very helpful and patient. \n\nTip- try the homemade berry lemonade if available\nTip- call ahead to find out about the wait- avoid the rush! \nTip- as mentioned in almost all other reviews, this place is very tiny- not a good for large parties or the claustrophobic.	12	7	8	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	04J_q_VhSBItxNiEAN-gkA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
ejtzy9KCK5dGahln3jFcsw	5	2010-06-07 00:00:00	This is a true breakfast/quick lunch spot. If you go in there with 6 people, you dont get it. If youre mad you had to wait 30 minutes for a 2 top, you dont get it. If you dont put your name down, YOU DONT GET IT! But if you can just show up, put your name on a list, and patiently wait till it gets called you will be privied to one of the best b-fast joints in town. Everything from top to bottom just tastes fresh (mostly because their product is almost all locally provided). The Chop an Chick is a great place to start, a hearty pork chop that has been marinating in some sort of love, most of the breakfasts are served with your choice of gold potatoes with rosemary and onions, or hashbrowns, eggs, and toast from Tammy Co. Bakery, they also serve it with fresh preservatives. The special is always good and always different! All in all I drive 25 minutes to this place atleast once a month and I have yet to have any sort of dissapointment once. If you ask, wheres my toast, YOU DONT GET IT!!!!	1	2	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	hyU3GKWcesZu8g1fMuDL7w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
eK21lzUTaRufUh0DGk6bLQ	5	2009-01-26 00:00:00	After finally going I definitely believe all the hype. Everything I got was delicious; the pancakes, waffle, eggs, bacon, hash browns and even fresh squeezed orange juice. I got there at 9:20 on a Sunday and there was about an hour wait, but it was well worth it. \n\nIt is a very small restaurant, but that obviously does not stop the people from enjoying their great food. The service was on point, our food came out right away and when I ordered some extra things, that came out right away too. I would definitely like to try their lunch menu as well.	1	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	JaWyPlPiQajclZbaa19PDg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
ek2DC713zFUUYhdPlw3dLg	4	2010-03-13 00:00:00	After standing in line a few minutes on a weekday, we made our way to the bar, I ordered up some pancakes. I should have had the special which turned out to look really good. The pancakes were alright, not great but OK. One thing about pancakes they are designed to need syrup, after all a pancake is a syrup delivery system. The pancakes came with about 1 ounce, about half of a shot glass of syrup. I knew right off that wasn't going to get it done but I figured no problem I would just ask for some more. I asked for more syrup and the lady wanted to make sure I understood they charge $1.50 for syrup, I said bring it on after all what good are pancakes without syrup. The refill came and it was probably about 1/2 an ounce of syrup. I ate most of the pancakes but ended up leaving some since pancakes without syrup is boring.	3	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	zIewiUTCheSak1c_vd4hvQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

If you are looking for a delicious well cooked breakfast, this has to be one of the best places in Phoenix.  I had the Hog and Chick very fulfilling meal.  Only thing I didn't like was the parking situation, not good.  Parking meters in front bring change.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	nxt_RCWMaCcMHcw8ezv0HQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The place is small (very small), expect to wait around an hour on the weekends.\n\nOnce you get in here try the "Hog and Chick", I suggest you get the hash browns over the potatoes, and you MUST MUST MUST try the bacon! (if you're a vegan - let it go for one day!) \n\nTheir waffles are to die for too.\n\nAnother 100 places like this and Downtown Phoenix will be THE place to live!!!	2	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	PeLGa5vUR8_mcsn-fn42Jg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Can I get a big woooooot wooooot!!!  MBB is an awesome LITTLE joint to stop at for breakfast.  I stress little because while the food is tall in stature, the place is small small small.  If you're going to go on the weekend, go early.  You probably have much less chance of a wait during the week.  \n\nDefinitely a hot spot for breakfast in Phoenix.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	QBnGYzmB_696kBJCdT_T1Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
EnJ5Y_62mFC2S4C-3VYV2g	4	2008-08-25 00:00:00	I've sadly become one of those people who turn to the Food Network for restaurant recommendations. Okay, not all the time but when a segment airs about thick cut bacon and huge burger patties cooked in butter, I immediately start making travel plans.\n\nWe arrived at Matt's for a late-lunch. Being that it was a weekday and close to 2pm, the restaurant was nearly empty and we didn't have to endure the wait or the harried service. In fact, other than a mix-up with toast, the staff was attentive and eager to please (or get us out so they could go home).\n\nI ordered the jalapeno burger with kettle chips and Jules got the Hog & Chick - 2 eggs with bacon. Her hash browns were buttery and sweet. My burger was juicy with a nice kick.\n\nI don't know if I'll jump on the plane the next time I see a tempting food segment but am I glad that we made a trip for some bacon and burger? You bet.	3	3	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	P9wmvuch_JmAa0SCfo3gdQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

EQQ96ppV5fbsJegpznz9rQ	1	2009-05-10 00:00:00	Ok, someone please explain something to me, WHAT ON EARTH HAS MADE THIS PLACE SO POPULAR????? I went to check this place out after seeing it on DDD. It looked interesting and the food looked like it could be pretty good. Well, not to sound mean or anything but, I can make much better breakfast in my own kitchen for about half the price. Any Denny's in America makes a better breakfast and you don't have to wait in line for an hour and a half either. Im sorry but I just don't get it. The only thing that "wasn't" completely average was the bacon. The portions were WAY to small and the food was WAY, WAY over priced. "Good food, good portion size, good price". This place breaks all 3 of those rules. Come on people lets stop following the crowd and lets try and open our minds a little. If everyone would do that I don't think Matts would be in business much longer.	2	3	5	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	nO375HmzagqxwcLwFucE2Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
ERoYA6wvq7kc_MZpiio-KA	4	2009-10-30 00:00:00	I have wanted to visit Matt's for quite some time now. My attempts have always been thwarted due to the extraordinary lines, the lack of time, and a growling stomach. Today, finally, I remedied that situation and finally ate at Matt's.\n\nIs Matt's overhyped? Perhaps. The small venue nearly guarantees a long wait. Is the food worth it? That is always a matter of opinion, but in mine, I think it was. I ordered the pancakes, pancakes that happened to be lightest and fluffiest I have probably ever eaten. For a side, I chose the cranberry walnut toast. It was good, as expected. Toast is hard to mess up unless obviously burnt. The friend who ate with me ordered the special that day, an egg scramble with sausage, havarti, and sweet peppers and rosemary. After sampling a bite, I wish I had ordered the special instead. The pancakes were good, but the special was great.\n\nWill I go back to Matt's? The answer is yes, though realistically it may not happen for a while due to the typical long wait times. Given the fact a wait is common, it might be a nice add to offer free WiFi or free coffee service outside for those waiting.	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	gn07pRXpaatiwG9pv7RiRA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
ERQnAHlYQ2p1R_L26F4d4A	5	2011-03-19 00:00:00	Went to Matt's Big Breakfast before our morning flight out of PHX airport after seeing reviews here.   We were lucky to find them open on Monday since they were not open Mondays in the past.\n\nThere was no wait for our party of two and were promptly greeted and informed of the daily special.  The waitress was very nice and attentive. \n\nI had the special which was a three egg scramble with canadian bacon and locally grown asparagus along with home fries.  K had the eggs, bacon, and hash browns.  Both meals came with toast and preserves.  Both the wheat and sourdough toast were thick slices and very fresh.  Everything was  fresh and tasty.  (Total bill $22.)\n\nWe will definitely be stopping back here in future trips to the area as it was a delicious meal.  I highly recommend this place to anyone although it is so very small that it is a good idea to get there early (they open at 630) seeing as we got there at 730 and by 815 there was a line to sit.	4	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	laH5dbH3Dwpov6KBRWzMbA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
eU_rVEvOmroRAh_ejO_5Cw	5	2011-03-16 00:00:00	I won't lie. I had been dying to try Matt's Big Breakfast ever since I saw it on DDD years ago. Since I live in NorCal, and the only reason for me to visit the Phoenix area is MLB spring training, Matt's has remained an elusive temptation, taunting me from afar. \n\nSo when I decided, after a 20 year absence, to take another trip to baseball's March mecca, I knew that a visit to Matt's was on my short "must do" list. I LOVE breakfast, and I am willing to wait for a good one.\n\nIt was a little intimidating to roll up and see the hoard of people waiting outside the restaurant on a Tuesday morning, but we put our name on the list and took our place amongst the throng.\n\nWe were seated after a wait of just under an hour and the waitress arrived promptly to take our order. My dining buddy and I both ordered the Hog and Chick, she with soft scrambled eggs, sausage and homefries, and I with over medium eggs, bacon and hash browns. We also decided to split a waffle. The homefried potatoes were good, but the hash browns were out of this world-- crispy on the top and bottom and soft and buttery in between. Seriously the best hash browns I've ever had. The bacon was thick and peppery, and lthough the waffle was tasty, I would have preferred it to have a crispier outside. The hand sliced whole wheat toast with homemade strawberry jam was perfect.\n\nI've been to a few places featured on Food Network, and though some of them haven't lived up to expectations, a few of them are home runs (Voula's Offshore Cafe, The Squeeze Inn, Bette's Oceanview Diner). Matt's knocks it out of the park.	9	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	8PbNqQZIxGYx0Q1Y8GMOXA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
eVr5xz4AiCUse6VYBsV4Jw	5	2007-04-23 00:00:00	I finally made the great Breakfast pilgrimage.  It was worth every minute of the wait.  We put in our names, and walked over to the downtown market to kill some time.  We still had to wait about 15 minutes after that, but it was a great way to go.  Highly suggest it.  \n\nThe best pancakes I've ever had.  Ever.  And the home fries?  I could eat just a big bowl of that and be happy.  Great rosemary taste.  Really loved the coffee. Yummy peppery bacon.  One of our companions said the ham was the best she'd had since she's lived in Tennessee more than 15 years ago.  \n\nRight before we left, we saw someone served a hamburger and we could hardly move.  It was the best looking burger I've ever seen.  We will TOTALLY be back just for lunch. Mmm.  Mmm.  Mmmm...  \n\nBut Matt himself cracking jokes with the patrons and chatting with downtown neighbors walking by was awesome.  While the food felt made with love, the big guy's personality totally put it over the top. You love supporting him supporting downtown.  Its the kind of business you would almost like to go even if it wasn't that good.  But thank goodness - it is that good.  Can't wait to go back.  \n\nVery.  Very.

When we finally caught them on an odd morning when the wait was reasonable, found the food was good but not worth the hype.  Plus, had to ask 3 times for my side waffle, and when it was brought out she poured the syrup all over me and made only a half effort to clean it up.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	T1q-4gXtDivFbGrBfW2K8w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

No, I mean I really don't like lines and I have horrible Disney World nightmares that sometimes wake me up.  Despite my hatred of lines, I love Matt's and I dream of Matt's, too, and sometimes I even find myself in line at Matt's in the blazing heat, waiting for those wonderful pancakes and floating like Bugs Bunny to a carrot.  I think I said something silly in my last review, like, "I won't go back for months because of the lines," but I was back and I felt guilty, so I'm rewriting the review to assuage my guilt and allow me a future guilt-free experience as I devour their pancakes.\n\nI wasn't kidding about the scooter gang, though.  Seriously, there was a scooter gang in line.	0	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	LkJSvJy7KaxVBPpWBFJe6g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
FB09aH1uK8-LxqC396IK5g	4	2011-06-03 00:00:00	I love Matt's big breakfast. I don't go there all the time. But any place that makes me drive a pretty good distance and wait in line just for breakfast! Must be doing something right. Went there this morning with my girlfriend. And we was greeted by a cute and very intelligent kid that was the owners son. Didn't have to wait to long but it was a nice day. I always get the griddlecakes when I go there. Ive never had anything even close to there's anywhere else. I can't give it 5 stars because of the wait and because its pretty small in there. And its always kind of weird eating breakfast next to a big window where people who are waiting outside can sit there and stare at you. I feel like im on display at a zoo eating. But those are minor gripes. I go to Matts for the food and the food never disappoints.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	zaxb0cSAjN8XcEFd0Tc44Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

fg-sD7anHbmCpzveuJ1buw	5	2008-05-02 00:00:00	Matt's Big Breakfast:\n\nYes it's busy.  Yes it's tiny.  And yes there's a 45 min. wait on a weekday @ 10:30.  Don't you people work?!  \n\nBut you know what?  All these things add to the charm of the place.  I secretly believe that people like to wait, they love the anticipation, people eat that sh*t up.  \n\nNow, with that being said, on to the food, it truly is delicious. There is no hype when the restaurant can actually deliver and prove that it was worth every minute of the wait. \n\nLemonade: fresh squeezed and flavored with honey.  A natural sweetener that is incredibly refreshing on a hot day. \n\nWaffle: most definitely the best waffle I have ever had.  Fluffy, light, piping hot, real butter and real maple syrup. \n\nOmelet: quite possibly the best omelet I have ever had.  Cooked to perfection with American cheese, mushrooms and bacon.  No skimping on these additions either, large button mushrooms, plenty of cheese and large chunks of thick cut bacon. \n\nThe bottom line....\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast:\n\nBig on taste.  Big on portions.  Big on appeal.  Even bigger on charm.	5	4	5	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ji1G3detbcEmjaO0rQU0yg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
Fhj0IOMwgpRAnKtLzVxvNQ	4	2012-09-18 00:00:00	This was the first time I had gone to Matt's Big Breakfast. I had heard some amazing things about it, outside of the fact that the wait times were horrendous, due to the fact that their original location was SO small. Low and behold, they opened up a second location, more than twice the size of their original one (still pretty small to be honest), so we HAD to try it. \n\nWe arrived at 7am on a Saturday morning, thinking we'd have NO issues getting in THAT early. We were wrong. We waited an hour or so... it could have been a longer wait though since our whole party didn't show up til 7:15ish. After the long anticipated wait, we finally ordered! Let me just mention, you really can't substitute or make many changes, if any, to your order. I ordered pancakes and wanted some blueberries, but was told no, lol. Regardless, the pancakes were super delicious! And they came with real maple syrup. Side note... use the syrup sparingly, asking for any extra will cost you an additional $1.50 :P\n\nOn another note, I heard their eggs benedict was AMAZING! Sadly, it's only a special and it wasn't on the day I went. I may just have to go again to try it!	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	TKel5cyUQOWx0NAn5gR-pg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
fLe5xmDYUiNbbxgUtJMN6Q	5	2010-09-21 00:00:00	The Chop and the Chick..............oh my pesto encrusted pork chop will I ever get to have you again? It was over 100 degrees, it was over an hour wait, but they keep ice water outside so you don't die, and, in my opinion, its worth the wait to experience dining inside- at least once. After that if you wanna come back, just order your goods to go. \n\nBut back to the pork chop.......it was incredible. It was perfectly cooked, and sometimes Porkchops are hit or miss when it comes to moist and dry. But this chop was plump and moist and pesto-y and out of this world. The ambiance and decor of this place was retro-vintage-mod, mostly white w/little but unique decor.  I loved my dining experience there, from the service to the food.  I'd definitely come back!!	3	2	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	96us9i9zB7QIxBtyRlhvDQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
FlHJD5tFeeP-5BQCaNgQtw	4	2011-11-17 00:00:00	So until today I didn't know there was a lot of hype about this place.  Ashley L. suggested it and I said sure why not.  While waiting for her in the parking lot, doors locked and windows up, I decided to look at it on Yelp.  Wow was there a lot of reviews.  \nSo we got there early and there was no wait.  I guess that is rare.  We both got The Hog and Chick with bacon and sourdough bread she got eggs over hard and I got them scrambled and we shared a stack of pancakes.  I have to admit that the food was really good.  I am not saying this because others have said it but because it is my own opinion.  Like I said I didn't even know it existed until she suggested it.  The service was great and we had a great experience. \nMy only problem is the size.  It is tiny.  Wow.  There is a place on the west side known as The Place and it used to be in a small location and moved to a larger one.  Much easier to get in and the food is still great.  They may stay there because it feels quaint but that I think was the only flaw I saw.	5	0	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Nkne0ukWVrzL3HFf1JuOmw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

And there is no way I'm going to wait for hours to give this place another chance.  If you want to wait in line for two hours and then receive a cup of grease along with your hash browns and eggs, then Matt's is the place for you.  Disgusting!

Was wrong to believe them. It was normal breakfast food that just tasted fresher than what you could eat at Denny's. Not sure why people are obsessed with it. I guess for that long of a wait you expect very yummy food and it was a let down.	0	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	MzNJ_gbrAbmPrkb6rF4o8A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Best Belgian style waffle I have ever had. It really is amazing. Butter was tasty and I even loved their syrup (I normally despise syrup). Their syrup lacked that really pungent smell that usually makes me a little sick. And it was a lot thinner than most syrups I've seen. Very yummy. You can tell everything is really fresh. Would highly recommend it. Service was friendly and came around frequently, but the wait and metered parking knocked it down from 5 to 4 stars.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	4M4qM82OPupdyzfyV6gqig	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The only draw back to Matt's is that it is just so small.  But then again, that is part of it's charm.  This is a tiny little house on a corner in downtown Phoenix.  I can just imagine what the weight is like on the weekends.  They have great fresh food and coffee.  I had the "Hog an Chick" meat and eggs....applewood smoked bacon...YUM!!  And the potatoes reminded me of my Uncle Ernie's potatoes.  So good with herbs and onions.  I gobbled up every bite!!  My coffee cup was never empty and the sourdough toast was .....mmmmm toasty.  I loved Matt's.  Just be sure to bring lots of quarters because there is nothing but metered parking all around.	5	3	4	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	-_vcdcTeTYp70lNsHrHljA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

A small diner, with a great small town atmosphere rules the morning meals. \n\nI got a recommendation from a collegue who like me was hungry for a good meal to get the day started. That said a short walk from the hotel, we quickly found a place with a crowd surrounding it. \n\nWe signed in and found a place outside to sit and wait. Friday morning, 9 am, we waited about 20 minutes. \n\nThe tables are small, their glasses of orange juice aren't very large, however it was freshly squeeed from what I could tell. \n\nWe both had the special, and it was a nicely portioned meal that filled is both up without regret. Their fasted fresh, and it was full of flavor. It was perfect for the morning.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ZPoxivgZ9mnZQZiuYmFgjw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

FvAbDNBMqmhvg4DilCY3pQ	5	2011-08-30 00:00:00	Like most great places, a review isn't necessary, so I haven't done so.  My latest visit gave me the need to do so, though.  I needn't say what's already been said, as most of the reviews are the same.\n\n1) You will wait, no matter what time of day or time of year.  Hot summer mornings, early, will have the shortest wait.  If you've never been here, what you do is show up, write down your name and the number of people in your party, snag some water and find some shade.  It's suggested you have good company or a book - you can get bored waiting!\n\n2) All the food is good.  All the food is fresh.  If there is a daily special, get it.\n\n3) Everyone rants and raves about the potatoes.  I could remove one star just to prove a point, but this is a five star place.  The hashbrowns are good because of the potatoes.  They are extremely fresh and full-flavored, unlike anything you get at most restaurants.  That said, they're not the *WORLDS GREATEST HASHBROWNS EVERRRRRRRRRRRR*.  They're fantastic, but they are a bit mushy on the inside.  They are possibly the very best potatoes in town, all said and done.\n\n4) Four Barrel coffee is served here now, instead of Cave Creek.  I'm all for this.  Despite it not being local, it is better than a lot of local roasts.\n\n5) Go here.	2	2	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	2QX1hoBlCgqIyJjGvr8TVw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
fVJStc0nFiXKqfcVL4CRIg	4	2011-11-02 00:00:00	Ok, so I have heard all the hype over Matt's and just never thought to go, as I don't usually have the patience to wait 2 hours to eat.  Fortunately, the missus and I had this morning off together and thought it might be easier to get in for breaky.  The wait was about 15 minutes when we got there, which is nothin.  We were seated at the table why the window and were greeted promptly.  I had a coffee and we both had fresh squeezed oj.  We both opted for the cheese omelette with mushrooms and onions, I had whole grain toast and she had sourdough that was served with house-made preserves (the bread, I learned, comes from Wildflower Bakery) and it was soooo effing good!  The hashbrowns were magical, all golden brown delicious on the outside and soft and gooey in the middle. We also shared a waffle for a breakfast-style dessert.  It was very good and I will definitely go back for more!!	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	CXVMRsnbuuNKetMy_gAyBw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

FzOLDPARKj8xS_2FW__2Xg	3	2010-04-05 00:00:00	Well I have heard the hype, seen it on DDD and viewed the lines wrapped around the block. A few friends raved about this place. I should have taken note to "who" of my friends were raving about it. They tend to eat anything.\n\nI will not say the food is bad. It is actually good. However, nothing that requires this much attention. I grew up in NYC and we had tons of great diners serving bkfst, lunch, dinner and late late night meals. The food is freshly made. The most impressive thing on my visit was the fresh squeezed o.j. It was perfect.\n\nThe menu is small and I swear they don't have a green veggie or fruit in that place. It is carb and fat overload. The portions are huge. But I know this is what some people like and what they go for.\n\nI was bamboozled by a friend into going here. He suggested lunch and was paying. Of course I will be gracious and go where he wants to go. I guess a part of me wanted to see what all the hype was about. \n\nI don't usually eat this type of food, which might be the problem right there. I don't get excited off plates full of pork, flour, syrup, carbs and more carbs. After waiting 30 mins or so I was hungry and decided that I will pay for the meal ltr by a kick butt hike. Well lets just say no hike happened. I took an extended nap ltr that day. That heavy food sucked the living energy out of me for two days. Ohh Matt your big breakfast was so not for me. \n\nIf this is your kind of food I am sure you will enjoy it. If you don't eat this way often be prepared to feel like you ate a ton of bricks the next few days.	0	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	US72XuETHCnMS0lItZGzMA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I ordered the 5 spot with hash browns. \nThe hash browns were really good, thin & crispy. I didn't really like my sandwich that much, it was ok. I didn't really cAre too much for the grilled onions & thick bacon....I think I prefer thinner crispier bacon? All in all I wouldn't wait 2 hours again to eat here- it seemed average to me but glad I tried it. Oh & one last thing I didn't like that they didn't have free refills on beverages...it was sold by the bottle or can.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ciKVTnZ1ucyt2gJgnBbBrQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

And I'm sure I'll get some flack for it!\n\nI met a friend at Matt's for breakfast around 9am on a Saturday. I expected a wait, and a wait we got. It wasn't too bad, there were benches and shade and lots of conversation. After about 30 minutes we were seated at the bar inside the teeny tiny restaurant.\n\nI loved the simple old-school vibe. We ordered and our food came out FAST, which was nice since we'd been waiting a bit. The food was simple and good, and the service was really great. But why all the hype?  Is it rude of me to give a lesser rating because the place doesn't hold up to the Yelp standard?\n\nI will absolutely give it a second chance, but I fear Matt's might be one of those places people love because other people love it.	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	RyeaKN9FOBhDf07yGcYTKg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The actual restaurant itself is very small, obvious reason for the wait.  I ordered the Special of the Day - Huevos Rancheros along with an order of Griddle Cakes, both were quite delicious. Overall, the only negative was the wait which again wasn't as bad I was expecting.  \nI definitely will come back to this place, guaranteed a good breakfast.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	yyuM6W2rpjym9YaCoKgH4Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
G2QOObQ2nLdTSDN52tmV3Q	5	2011-01-03 00:00:00	My favorite breakfast place.  Love the food, love the prices, love the decor.  But...\n\nHATE THE WAIT.\n\nThey know me.  My wife and I bring our two small kids here every week or two.  But our AVERAGE wait time, sitting in front on nice modernist benches, is about 25 minutes.  \n\nIt sucks.  I wish they would get rid of two rows of parking, put up an overhead tent with heaters/misters.\n\nBut I think the fact that people have to wait actually increases the love of the place?  Strange, huh.\n\nFood is delicious.  I love the aged cheese omelet.  Go for the home fries, which are delicious and dusted with fresh rosemary, over the overly buttery hash browns.  Almost everything on the menu is perfect.  My kids do a single pancake, perfectly cooked, with great syrup.  \n\nTheir bread may be the best part.  Fresh, thick cut bread with butter and fresh jam/jelly.\n\nLook, it's a slightly upscale "diner food" that is well worth every $ you spend and every calorie you consume.  \n\nI hate to give a good review... what if even MORE people come and my wait is even LONGER... :(	0	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	6ZEIvCcj3xCx8TNH7-R64A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

gGLINvCpBxX3vdDW7I5gVw	4	2010-12-03 00:00:00	I'd been waiting for the perfect time to experience Matt's.  This Wednesday morning I felt like that time had come.  I figured Wednesday at 11am shouldn't have much of a wait.  It didn't, and we were seated within 10-15 minutes.  The place is cute and the service is really great once you get seated (until then everyone looks kinda rushed and annoyed by you).  \n\nOur experience had it's high points:\n*Our extremely sweet server (love those glasses)\n*The ridiculously good coffee\n*and the novelty of eating in a shoe box.\n\nI got the Hog and Chick with Bacon.  It was yummy, but...gasp....nothing to wait an hour and a half for like most people do on the weekends.  Yes the bacon was thick cut, and the preserves for the toast were lovely, but still, I actually had a hard time picking something off of the menu because nothing seemed to jump out at me as unique or unmissable.  \nOne thing's for sure though, they do the classics well.\nFor me, the above high points are enough to bring me back again, and hopefully next time the special will rock my socks off.  \n\nMatt and Ernie have a great group of concepts, thanks for bringing downtown up a notch.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	6sOrsHBiRkeAQrg8Lrhuqw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
GgqwHzHBJrdhkyB48scPdQ	2	2008-07-27 00:00:00	Average at best.  I have been here 3 times, primarily based on all the hype and wanting to be sure that I was giving Matt's a fair shake.  Listen, it's not terrible...but it's just nothing special at all.  The menu is basic and unimaginative.  I guess I would expect some creativity in the menu selections for such a "hot spot," but alas there is none.  The execution is ok, but not great.  I thought the hash browns were terrible (greasy and overdone) and the rest of it was quite ordinary, if not excessively greasy.  It's small and crowded.  The service was generally fine.  I also thought it was a bit overpriced...particularly the OJ, which I think was like $4 for a tiny glass of what seemed to be made-from-concentrate OJ.  Anyway, I think I'm done with this place.	3	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	29OVXYSJw7fvy4KHwVgfmw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

WOW is all I can say we were both impressed and I really enjoyed the waffle and the thick sliced bacon.\n\nI really really enjoyed the thick sliced bread with the strawberry preserves and the omelet was amazing. Also the chocolate milk was very very good.\n\nIf your in phoenix I cant say enough that you should try Matt 's for friendly service and great food.

The waffle was good, but didn't reach the amazing wonder that was the bacon.\n\nBut if you're planning for a weekend pilgrimage then prepare yourself well for a super duper long wait, followed by quick rush out of the tiny diner space as soon as you're done with your food.   \n\nIf you want a nice leisurely brunch then go some place with more seating, or you can take the drive down to Queen Creek and stock up on that incredibly delicious pepper bacon from the Pork Shop.	2	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	xovKY9oB8s-NjKz_I1RpHQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

GpafLu2jnTrnotDlAASfgw	3	2012-12-10 00:00:00	Good occasion get some friends together who are virgin Matt's BB goers and we waited about 40 min for our table which ultimately wasn't too bad as we got seated in the private VIP nook at the front of their newly located establishment. The decor was plain and simple and service was top notch as our water was always topped up. I went for brekkie with the hog and chick and hubby did the BLT and our other two friends also went with lunch. \n\nSomehow I remembered that the hashbrowns were better than what I dined on today, there was a slight bitter/sour slant to them and I was a bit put off, perhaps too over buttered for my taste today, however thick cut slice bacon saved the day as usual. \n\nAll in all the company was priceless and we will likely stick to eating near our place as it is a trek.	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	uny77jqxY9JDmZcK8bnISw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
GpOv2GWR7adP2ghXIXQOvw	5	2009-01-06 00:00:00	Yes, I will admit that my family watches Triple D.  Now with that said my wife and I have been to a few of the joints showcased on that show.  As many of you that have started this journey like we have you find killer places and some okay places.  Matt's is a KILLER place.\n\nMy wife and I were recently in the Phoenix area for a part of our vacation and planned to stop in for breakfast at Matt's the first morning.  We got there ~8am on Saturday morning and only had to wait about 15 minutes.  Yes the place was small but being the two of us it was not a challenge.  There are about 9 tables total (assuming setup for 2) and 8 or so counter spots.\n\nThe food is awesome!!  It was so good we changed our plans and went back the next morning! \n\nHere is what we had:\n\nPork chop marinated with pesto and eggs with home fries, side of bacon and toast with their very tasty home made jelly.  The pork chop is to die for.  I am a big pork chop for breakfast fan and usually very disappointed.  Not at Matt's, it was tender and cooked perfectly.  My eggs were cooked exactly like I asked for and the bacon is like think slices of heaven!  I had to have bacon both mornings and I am not a breakfast bacon fan usually.  This bacon would make anything taste great!  My wife had the daily special which was chicken sausage, fresh spinach and fontina cheese scramble.  Once again cooked perfect, not greasy at all but with big flavor.  We both had home fries which were incredible.  Nice crust with some rosemary and caramelized onions.  Pretty close to perfect!\n\nThe next day my wife had the waffle, which she liked.  The fresh maple syrup was the real star of this dish.  She was kind enough to pass the bacon to me (I know twist my arm).  I had the breakfast special which was a sirloin steak, eggs and hash browns.  The steak was SUPER tender and cooked EXACTLY how I asked (you can tell I do not experience that often).  It was obviously a good cut of meat and had been seasoned very nicely.  The hash browns were very nice.  Crust on both sides and tender in the middle.  Exactly what you would hope for.  Lastly was their toast and home made jelly.  It was like butter!!!  Nothing like your store bought jelly.  I am not a jelly fan but ate all of it both mornings!!!\n\nAs for the service it was pretty good.  They were slammed on the first morning but were pleasant.  The family atmosphere really made the hustle and bustle not so bad.  The second time we went in they remembered us and took the time to talk for a few minutes and show their appreciation for us coming back so soon.  Very nice touch!\n\nOverall this now my favorite breakfast joint from Triple D.  Whenever I travel to Phoenix I will plan to stop in.  I would highly recommend it to anyone that wants breakfast cooked the way it should be!	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	7Wxxe4P8NGKlLqU8TKecbQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

gZzrvUhpn7YUpfCMlI92Ew	5	2012-06-21 00:00:00	Until I read the rant reviews about Matt's I never knew there could be so many people with cold coffee running through their veins.  Wow.\n\nSumming it down, it seems the #1 complaint is at Matt's (unlike Denny's) they have to wait in the hot Phoenix sun to get in or that the place is "small".  DUH!  If you go to a place that serves better-than-average food, and it is a small old historic place it's not going to be the same as squeezing your tubby stomach into a booth at Denny's and ordering an "out of your mind" $1.99 breakfast to make your butt even bigger.  In other words, if you like Denny's so much why did you go to Matt's?\n\nMake your choice ... pre-processed food from a mega-chain, or fresh food from local guy who works hard to serve locally grown/bought products and has gotten extremely popular because of it.  Small?  Are you kidding?  That's GOOD, not negative, how can you possibly rate a place bad because it is small?\n\nHate the Food Network?  Geez ... then don't go to a place that has been so highly rated.  Why subject your tender spoiled body to waiting in that "miserable" Phoenix sun?  People waiting in line means they know where to find great food.  BTW, my first few visits to Matt's were BEFORE Triple-D and it was and remains a place to go for people who have good taste.  And the complaint about having to go to the bathroom in the kitchen is pure BS - the clean bathroom is in the motel next door, not the kitchen.\n\nWe only have one Matt's in Phoenix and thank you heavens.  Is the food good?  Yes?  Is it fresh and uses the best local products?  Yes?  Is the service friendly and local?  Yes (if you're a tourist or Snow-Bird you just won't get this concept anyway).  Somebody believes the OJ is $2.50 for 2 ounces?  Really?  REALLY??  \n\nHere are a few personal observations:  I don't eat potatoes much, but I almost always finish Matt's home fries.  I am not a big bread eater, but I love Matt's fresh home-made bread.  Their eggs are local and bought by Matt every morning (he doesn't own a refrigerator or microwave at his restaurant).  The bacon on NOT what you will find at Denny's (a place you can walk right in to without having to spend 30 minutes of your precious self-consumed life standing in that horrid Phoenix sun). No, NO, I'm serious, there are actually tourists who reviewed Matt's and compared them negatively to DENNY'S!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhere Matt's really shines is not so much their excellent breakfasts, but the fact that they probably make one of the best Reuben Sandwiches in America.  Yes, better than Manhattan, better than that place where you chomp into a lot of fat and bread and pay twice as much for the privilege.  Not only is the sandwich great but the side of homemade macaroni salad is big enough to serve the entire restaurant.\n\nWant to avoid the 30 minute wait for breakfast?  Go to Matt's for lunch when the place is much less busy and get to know the people who work there and why their food is several cuts above most of what you will find in Phoenix.	2	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Pj9YpaP0T7A_5S_PT8IpNg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
H604MSzDa45KWT5Z5hhbGQ	2	2007-11-03 00:00:00	I like the bright, small-diner atmosphere and the use of cage-free eggs, organic produce and grain-fed natural Iowa pork and Angus beef.  I found the rationale stated on the backs of the menus and on the website, "We believe that food prepared this way not only tastes better but is better for you" quite ironic considering the amount of butter and olive oil their food is fried in.  My stomach couldn't take it.  I guess if I go back for breakfast, I can always get the Frosted Flakes for $4.	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	VEMEt3AqHr6hPac2wzf8Hw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I generally order sausage with eggs but you have to get the bacon here. I have ordered the burger before and it is a very good size good quality burger. Don't missed the old location which is less than a block away from the new restaurant. DDD was there for a reason.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	SRK_sUnvRmMwfexoL_DLQA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
H6JyOdgq4rN6zRMmOEGHpA	5	2010-07-31 00:00:00	When I was at Pizzeria Bianco, the second in line peeps mentioned that I try Matt's Big Breakfast. I had also saw the episode on Triple D with Guy Fieri and the dude raved that this was his fave. Now I had already put it on the "must go" list and then asked for recommendations. I was told to expect an hour wait, order the waffles or griddlecakes and the pork rib chop. Good info...\n\nIt was ambitious of us to want to wake up early to have Matt's, but we did eventually get there, even with the stoopid Android GPS getting us lost at First Ave and not First St. We had made a few passes around the block and saw the farmer's market diagonally from Matt's. I dropped off Kathy to put our names down, parked in the lot and headed over to the farmer's market. Now, you couldn't plan this any better, but the market is open Sat and Weds, so what better way to kill time, instead of sitting in heat? After about 40 mins, we headed back and got called immediately.\n\nWe got in and ordered waffles with a side of the griddlecakes, since Kathy couldn't decide. I went for the pesto crusted pork rib chop with home fries that were Yukon gold potatoes grilled with rosemary and onions and two eggs over easy. The batter used for both the waffles/griddlecakes were light and fluffy and when you factor in the homemade whipped butter and authentic Vermont maple syrup, the combination is Dyno-mite! My pork rib chop was tender and moist and the Yukon gold fries were absolutely perfect. The thick toast with a side of peach marmalade was delicious. I'm stoked they use locally grown produce, as that ensures that the food is always tip top. The super thick bacon that came with the waffles were just perfect balance of salt and savor. Simply bueno!\n\nI'm always in awe of the other reviewers who were expecting some Iron Chef to blow them away with spectacular gourmet food. To do the basic breakfast items and take them to another level should be spectacular in itself. I highly recommend Matt's Big Breakfast for simplistic elegance and for breakfast that truly did deserve Guy Fieri's adulation.\n\nHousekeeping items: Go Saturdays, so you can check out the Farmer's Market with all the free and tasty samples. That should keep you busy as your name floats to top of the wait list. The wait staff wants to turn over tables, so other Yelpers can get in and eat too. \n\nStay hungry my friends and happy eatings...	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	lkXuRqxYn_JIXWSbvc08nA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
HAfEKz0KOpa4ZXBJDEWM3w	4	2011-08-30 00:00:00	This is the first breakfast place I tried when I moved from Indiana to Arizona in May 2010. It is fantastic! \n\nOK, let me get the "negatives" out of the way: \n\n1. Small Place, (possible) Long Waits \n- Most people are impatient, no matter how good the food. If you are one of those people and want to eat here; get here BEFORE the doors open. \n\n2. OK, can't think of any more. \n\nAll the Positives: \n\n1. Yes it is small, but it has a wonderful old-school diner feel. \n2. The wait staff is friendly and attentive. \n3. The food is worth the wait! \n\nOn my trip to Matt's I had: \n\n1. Honey Lemonade (not as sweet as you might fear - very tasty) \n2. The Hog and Chick \n(Two eggs and choice of off-the-bone ham, thick-cut bacon, or country sausage - I went with the bacon) \n\nThe eggs were perfect; I always ask for over medium and rarely does a place get the consistency right (Matt's did). \n\nThe thick-cut bacon was always cooked to my specification - not too crispy; I still like a little chew to it. \n\nSince I got there at/before they opened, I was in right away, got my food, enjoyed it, and was out in about 30 mins. \n\nA small place, with great service, great food, and a loyal following. I can see why!	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	8MSZucmE47kH1av66SO_XA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Once inside we had trouble sitting on the bar stools, they are so small and slippery.(We aren't large people)\n  I stood up to eat my breakfast.

HcKcDVDfX66vxkOp5IHgRA	5	2010-05-25 00:00:00	Can't believe it took me so long to try this place! Heard about it from friends and of course saw it on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and I had been wanting to try it forever but just never had the chance. I finally tried it with some friends and WOW was it good! I had the salami scramble which was DELICIOUS! Never though of putting salami in eggs but I knew I had to try it and it was really delicious...the eggs and salami combo was really tasty. Got that with hash browns and sourdough toast...I have to say, the hash browns were the BEST I've ever tasted. I have no idea what they do to them to make them so good but they were amazing! Very crunchy too which I love. The toast and coffee were quite good as well, and I can't wait to try the pancakes next time!! Best breakfast I've had in a long time!	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	PYdSGRt4qZ2lG1Z8gB-PSw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
hdcmUiBwVvSyOI6582_Tcw	5	2011-01-06 00:00:00	Seriously, Matt's cooks up some of the best breakfast food I have ever had. I've been going here for three years or so, and I have never been disappointed. I've never waited much more than 30 minutes, but that's probably because I never go on weekends after 8:30 AM and never at lunch time on weekdays. \n\nTheir eggs benedict is hands down the best I have ever had. It's a special, so you have to be lucky to get it. Before I ever had their eggs benedict (the first was actually a sausage benedict with their AMAZING sausage), i had never really been a fan. But their benedict sparked such a deep love that whenever I've been in a restaurant that serves benedict, I always get it, but it never measures up. Their fresh hollandaise, perfectly poached egg, delicious ham and wonderful english muffin... just cannot be beat. And then you have their oh-so-buttery hash browns that I crave on a regular basis. I used to have a problem deciding between their also awesome homefries roasted perfectly with rosemary, but now I can't resist the hash browns. Also, their bacon is absolutely heavenly, and I'm not really a huge fan of bacon, so I always end up ordering a side of it. The omelets and pancakes are also always perfectly fluffy and delicious, and I've never found their portions to be remotely small. I always leave completely fat and happy. My only complaint that I can think of is that their delicious orange juice comes in an insanely small portion, but their delicious honey lemonade makes up for it.\n\nThis is always on my list of restaurants I absolutely have to go to when I'm home from college.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	TA8lMiUg95s2cveylmdVew	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

HiWrLFd_Q5IFFCRm0TMJaQ	1	2011-09-06 00:00:00	If you are craving basic nothing special breakfast food save yourself the hour long wait outside in the 100 degree heat and go eat at Denny's or IHOP.  Trust me you'll pay half as much and leave feeling less icky.\n\nI seriously don't understand the draw of this place.  The whole restaurant seats maybe 20-30 people, so we ended up sitting outside in the heat for over an hour waiting for a table.  Other reviews claim much longer wait times.  When we finally got a table our waitress was friendly enough and got our drink orders pretty promptly.  When they brought us our food  was nothing special just eggs, bacon, and hashbrowns.  The quality was no better than what you might get at any typical breakfast joint.  Seriously Food Network I don't understand what all the fuss is about.  The waitress forgot to bring us our bread.  After two requests and our meal just about finished our bread was finally delivered to the table.  Unfortunately, my boyfriend's bread had a little something extra...a nice long hair.  Disgusting!!  \n\nNever again.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	-SQeeulHTG1KxM1LbE_Fqw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
HjcMRi7G-0GlqKLxZ03Inw	5	2010-04-18 00:00:00	Yes you will have to wait. Is it worth it? YES. Today I visited with a friend of mine. I could smell the scent of bacon, coffee which fueled my appetite but I was craving a burger. You know a burger is good when no mayo, mustard, or ketchup are needed. Just the taste os a well cooked burger (side of kettle chips).  Expect a wait, most of the time. Come hungry. Waiting is outside (it is a very, very small building), but worth it. Next time, I will order the breakfast.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	4FQVx4326l2UnatfCMfRGg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
HkWgqaOyTQZwYGWXWjxX3w	4	2007-06-25 00:00:00	Buttery Buttery Buttery...YUMMY!\n\nAfter dealing with the WRONG way on 7th (thanks for nothing Yahoo! maps), we were now super duper hungry...and secretly, I need breakfast within 30 minutes of waking up. I knew there could be a weekend wait and with some toast in my belly I braved the hot noon sun. Located next to a sketchy hotel/residence space (hash browns AND heroin!), this small space is DAMN small. A nice walkway with cacti and rustic fence create a lil space, and dumps you into the counterspace/dining room. First impression-this place is WHITE-I mean, like the walls are white, the counter is, the seats are re-upholstered vintage chrome stools white, but the tables are a beautful blood orange formica-oh yeah, I like that...with lil' orange gerber daisies. Like so, cute.\n\nWe thought about sitting at the counter, but with a chance for shortie chairs, we went next to the window that actually gave a promising look of artsy downtown PHX-def. added to the experience instead of what I would consider a dreaded smooshed in one in the small room in the back (is that where bad people go to eat eggs?). After some confusion over why one would need water AND iced tea, I got to sample their coffee and orange juice. Man, I LOVED that orange juice-simply the best. And the coffee was good black, always a test of quality. The menu is small and due to the lack of veggies with the breakfast (does cheese count as a veggie?), I went with sweet instead of savoury. I got the belgian waffle (an option of fruit would have taken this to a whole 'nother level, btw) and WOW-but-ter-ry. I think made with real buttermilk too. With butter melting on top. Was the maple syrup made with butter too? Possible. I think maybe all of Matts Big Breakfast may be made of butter...mmmmm. It was so rich I really had to leave one lone piece on my plate. I could not eat it. Really. COULD NOT-immediate expulsion from the clean plate club. Totally ashamed of my inability for the MBB money shot.\n\nNice asides: \nThe taters are with caramelized onions and rosemary sprigs-HOLLA.\nI asked to have the bacon substituted with the afore-mentioned, and the waitress said that wasn't possible-but she did deduct buck and some change from the price of the waffle, which as a veggie I deeply appreciate-CLASSY\nParking lot and parking on street.\n\nBonus: Cute children will linger around your table and smile, much like nervous men at bars with bottles instead of beers, and not say much, making your experience alternate between unbearably cute and creepy.	3	5	4	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	je5k8a3qIOM0VJE5MaxsfQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I am so glad we did. Totally worth it. \n\nEverything was cooked perfect. The homemade bread with preserves was awesome. I got the hashbrowns which where great. So much butter which I know is bad for you but if you are coming here for breakfast I doubt health food is what you are looking for. My girlfriend got the home fries which where actually better. \n\nJust the best breakfast in town period. Go there and wait it out.

HPYZpFfXTVp-4Coa6xObxw	3	2010-08-25 00:00:00	I heard many people saying we should try Matt's Big Breakfast so we had to go.  This place is VERY small with very limited seating inside and no outside option when we were there.  We waited for about 45 minutes talking to people outside about how good it was.\n\nOnce seated, on the window bar stools, we were promptly greeted.  Service was good if not abrupt and to the point.  The portions were a good size, but there are bigger out there for sure.  \n\nOur food was good but nothing great as we had been hearing.  This is NOT worth the wait if you ask me, but I would go there as a neighborhood staple if no more than a 10 minute wait. \n\nFor my $ and time, I'm going to Farm House in Gilbert if I had a choice, now THAT PLACE is worth the wait.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	lhQsqPoCnjW4yvq34aBLgQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
hqDIwXOmUuxVh4df-U9BBA	3	2009-03-13 00:00:00	The Place: \nAfter reading many of the hundreds of reviews talking about the size of Matt's, I was still surprised when I pulled up with my family and the restaurant was the building that looked like a small shed.  LOL.  Forget small, the place is micro.  It has a bit of an urban chic/diner-vibe, but there is nothing to the appearance that would make someone ooh and aah.  Our table was two tables for two, butted together with two chairs facing the window/wall, and the other two facing each other, an odd, but space saving layout.  We were in the first room where there is also a tall bar to sit and eat, however that bar is also part of the "list".\n\nThe Food:\nI ordered the Hog & Chick with scrambled eggs, bacon, wheat toast, and home fries.  The bacon was as good as most have commented, a little sweet, smokey, and peppery.  The wheat toast was thick-cut and super grainy and served with raspberry lavender jam, both super.  The eggs were fresh, but just scrambled eggs.  In my opinion the highlight of my dish was the home fries - these potatoes were cut into chunks and fried with fresh rosemary twigs and onions.  I thought I needed ketchup for them, not hardly.  My wife tried the pancakes and wasn't particularly impressed, nor was I when I tried a bite.  They were okay, just not amazing.  Since there is no kids menu (which is an oversight in my mind) my older daughter ordered the waffle.  It smelled great, and she polished it off before I could get a taste.  I thought it looked good - and she said it tasted great.  Nice touch is that both waffles and pancakes come with REAL & VERY HOT maple syrup.  My other monkey, er daughter, had the Hog & Chick as well, however she had the hashbrowns and country ham.  The ham was good, but salty like good ham should be.  The hashbrowns were REALLY soaked in oil/butter.  They were crispy on both sides, but whoa ... really soaked.\n\nThe Bottom Line:\nWe got REALLY lucky in that we got there and were able to get seated within about 5 minutes.  This was around 8:30am on a Thursday, as soon as we were seated, the crowd showed up and there were at least 20 people milling around outside waiting to eat.  The parking stinks, micro lot behind the restaurant, and other than that it's metered parking.  $.60/hour is still cheap though.\n\nI enjoyed the food and the experience was a little to crazy for my family of four with two squirmy kids.  I'm not a hater, but I'm not going to tell you it's the best breakfast I've ever had either.  The prices were fair, but again with a family of four with two small kids we tend to appreciate a place with a kid menu.\n\nIf it was only adults and we weren't so wiggly it might have been a different story.  I'm not sure I'm headed back there any time soon with my little wiggle worms.  That being said, you should try it and see what you think.\n\n(big plus is that they took AMEX - one of the few small shops that do)	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	hg4AyAMgmQGO2tx6kjo8yw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
HR7gwmp6iTpUzlwurB52Hw	4	2012-09-23 00:00:00	Yay! I'm a fan! I tried Matt's Griddlecakes and Salami Scramble. Also tried the freshly squeezed orange juice and sipped on their coffee. \n\nHere's what I liked -- the griddlecakes are 3 stacked pancakes with "mystery" ingredients. It seems like they infused the pancakes with butter and milk. They place sweet cream butter on top! Please make sure to share this plate! It's very sweet and I could only eat half! They also mention to give real maple syrup on the side, which is a nice touch. I'm just a tad skeptical though if it is real. \n\nI do like their hash browns and salami scramble. It's a little on the salty side, but it is tasty! The orange juice to my surprise did taste great! I would definitely recommend this place to a friend!	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	2nE0zU6y_F7gkwHi3yL6cQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

But don't let the small size of this breakfast hot spot fool you, nor let the long wait deter you. Matt's had been right around the corner from me, and I had no idea until today what I had been missing out on. A group of friends and I all sprung for the daily special of scrambled eggs incorporated with hot links, white cheese, and peppers paired with delicious home fries. So while the wait, especially during a blustery summer day in Phoenix may make you want to stray, don't, and you will be in for a treat!	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	NXOMRw7UEUEd3Q95C58Jsg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
HvZsuIMZ3c2OFRtknKsHHA	3	2012-05-28 00:00:00	Finally made my way down to this place.  Was avoiding it because of the long wait everyone talks about but I had more time on my hands today so decided to give it a try.  Arrived around 12p on a Sunday and we were seated in about 45 min (party of 2- apparently, parties of 2 or 3 get seated the quickest).  Th wait wasn't so bad being that we found so shade and I had my phone to keep me occupied.  The hostess was very friendly.  The place is small.\n\nThe menu was a lot smaller than I expected.  For breakfast dishes, there were about 5-7 egg dish choices and a handful of other choices.  I opted for the griddlecakes and my husband ordered an omelette w/ cheddar, sausage and mushrooms.  He had coffee and I had the honey lemonade.  The lemonade was very refreshing, fresh squeezed and just the right sweetness.  As far as the food goes, it was good.  The sausage has a nice spice to it, the griddlecakes were light and fluffy, the strawberry jam and toast were yummy and the omelette was tasty.  My hubs ordered the hashbrowns with his dish and he prob should have gotten the home fries b/c they looked a lot better (based on the table next to us).\n\nI give it 3 stars b/c it's just good fresh food and, for the most part, cooked well (the hashbrowns were a litte more greasy than I prefer).  I don't know if I would go through the long wait for it in the future.  Coming from San Diego (Hash House, the Mission) and LA (The Griddle), it's missing something more unique to make it worth the wait.  I've waited 60-90 min for those places.  Def give it a try if you've never been.	1	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	kK0jULguPNF3Y1I8aM5EVQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

i60RRaBc4wht6fIdPA4Zsw	1	2012-12-02 00:00:00	The single handed worst breakfast experience I've ever had. The only time I've ever waited over 50 minutes for a table before giving up. I came alone on a Saturday at 9am. I asked how long the wait would be for a party of one and the hostess(I guess you could call her that) stated that, "they don't quote times, but that it goes fast." They don't write down the time you arrive so either management doesn't care how long the patrons are waiting for a table or are to dumb to look into it. I find it rude, disrespectful, and disingenuous to patrons to not quote a time on one hand while saying it goes fast on the other. They must have known that patrons were waiting close to an hour for a seat and they are hoping that we would become "pot committed" and hang out for the table. \n    Maybe they are hoping that you will wait so long that you get so hungry that the food will taste better. I've eaten at Matt's Big Breakfast before and I would give it 4 out of 5 stars on food quality. They aren't spectacular just good. Sadly Phoenix is deeply lacking in good breakfast joints. \n    So starving after a 50 minute wait I decided to head home and stop at McDonalds (also a one star restaurant, but at least I won't wait 50 minutes to get to place my order). While en route I drove by LO LO'S CHICKEN AND WAFFLES approx. 2 miles from Matt's big (slow) breakfast and noticed that it was fairly empty at 10am. I pulled in to Lo Lo's and was pleasantly surprised to find a hidden gem for breakfast. How about that the worst breakfast experience turns into one of the best. I was immediately sat at a table(there was enough space for 8 person parties. Coffee was promptly brought and it was perfect in every respect of the word. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and I was dumbfounded why I tried to go back to Matt's Big (slow) breakfast with so many other options available.\n    Two additional points I'd like to make: first, there was a bunch of people waiting for Matt's Big (slow) Breakfast but it wasn't a constant flow of additional people coming it was the same bunch of people waiting for 50+minutes; second, YOU'VE been warned.\n    If you want to try something different/unique/and worthwhile give LO LO's Chicken and Waffles a shot at breakfast. I don't mind waiting for a table at a desirable restaurant. What I mind is a restaurant that doesn't value it's patrons enough to respect their time and to allow their patrons to make conscious decision if they want to wait or not.	0	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	loG8W6cOsNFollQeGYO-Ew	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The food is great and people want to come here.\n\nThe waffle here is simply the best.  I've never had better, anywhere.  I've also had the burger, which was really, really, really good.  Next time I'll see if they can put a different cheese on it because I'm not a big fan of American cheese.  Regardless, everything here was delicious, regardless of the line.  If you're willing to wait, or maybe come at an off-hour, it's definitely worth the wait.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	tgyMunSEYZLDM216Ga9zlg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
iF6e1jbczKYhRask-zHSow	4	2011-10-26 00:00:00	We went at about 9 on a Monday morning, and didn't have to wait in line at all.  I had the Hog & Chick with bacon, hash browns, and sourdough toast.  It was fantastic.  The hash browns were a little crunchier on the outside and softer on the inside than I would have preferred, but overall they were good.  The bacon was different, but in a good way.  It was very thick, not overly crispy, a little sweet, and peppery.  I'm not usually a fan of bacon, but really enjoyed theirs.  The toast was fantastic.\n\nPerfect for: when you want a typical breakfast done better	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	OkEJBggP-HDcdkA4LYvVGg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
IfjB9aXs0JFaiigwl1TTzA	5	2012-05-08 00:00:00	do not be fazed by the massive amount of people waiting outside.  just put your name down on the notepad and make yourself comfortable.  the wait on a Sunday morning was 1 hr, which really is not all that bad.  turnover rate is quite fast.  the breakfast was very good and worth the wait.  i had the pork chop and eggs.  the chop was nicely marinaded and cooked well.  the toast was thick cut, with the right amount of butter (i.e. not soaking wet), and came with good strawberry jam with chunks of strawberries.  amazingly, even though the food looked like greasy diner food, it did not taste greasy!  i think it was the butter that made the difference.  i ate every bite of my breakfast and did not feel overloaded.  service was quick and pleasant although i did have to ask twice for ketchup.  seating will be crowded, but you'll be comfortable enough to enjoy your breakfast.  overall, a very good use of my sunday morning.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	9dPG2kAc2FP3RezYdLQh8A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Every time I bring the two year old with me the staff goes out their way to take care of this Daddy on a date with his daughter.  Hog and Chick is the staple and the hash brown taste like they've been cooked in a pound of butter.  Be still my beating heart... Eat any more and we'll see that.  The Missus had the pancakes and they were also great.  Fresh ingredients abound and you syrup isn't flavored corn syrup.  Real maple syrup!!!

The breakfast here is good don't get me wrong just skip breakfast & go 4 the butter burger. Also make sure u don't park on the empty dirt parking lots in front of & behind Matt's or you'll get a $120.00 ticket!

IKASS-BnWhurCDEwmh-E9Q	5	2010-09-29 00:00:00	Many reviewers indicate that it's worth the wait, and I MUST wholeheartedly agree!\n\nKnowing there would probably be a wait on a Sunday morning, my co-workers and I hustled ourselves out of bed a little earlier than we otherwise would have, checked out of our hotel, called for the valet to bring our car, and drove to Matt's.\n\nI was frankly surprised at how very tiny the building was - I knew it was small, but WOW!  There didn't seem to be *too* many people waiting before us, so we put our names on the list.\n\nWe waited probably 45 minutes, and were very glad that it hadn't gotten truly HOT out yet.  Once inside, the place looks even smaller than it did from outside.  We were seated at the bar, which honestly looked a lot less cramped than some of the other tables with "large" parties (read: more than 2-3 people).  I think the entire place might seat 20 people?\n\nWe were immediately asked for our drink orders (coffee, orange juice and water), then our food orders.\n\nI should have paid more attention to what my co-workers ordered (I know Hayden and Sheri shared an order of pancakes and bacon, and maybe something else, while John also had pancakes and something else with hash browns), but seriously?  Once my Belgian Waffle arrived, there was little room for me to pay attention to anything else.  \n\nI can't say I consider myself a connossieur of waffles or anything like that, but I've truly never tried another waffle that even comes close to comparing to this one.  The consistency was absolute PERFECTION!  It was crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and the texture was hearty enough to hold up to the (real!) butter and (real maple!) syrup I subjected it to.\n\nOh, yeah, I also had the thick-cut bacon.  It was just a little too peppery and a little too done for my taste, but it was still quite good.  John declared the hash browns to be the best he'd ever had, and the pancakes got the same pronouncement from Hayden and Sheri.\n\nService was spot-on and cheerful.\n\nThere's just a couple things I would change about Matt's if I had the opportunity:\n\nA) Expand.  With the demand, they could easily seat and serve twice or even three times as many customers and still have a wait on weekends!\n\nB) Get a public restroom.  My very first desire upon leaving was to find a restroom!\n\nC) Relocate.  Seriously, Austin needs a place this good!!!  I know at least 4 people who would ensure good business forever after...	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Jqts1Jow9-Xa8V2d8gKkUg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

That is how good this place is! \n\nRecently, on a business trip, we went for a sort of brunch/lunch. My wife had already had breakfast there that morning and insisted we return. Myself, being a skeptic, lowered my expectations so I would not burst her bubble. After my first bite of their Reuben sandwich and their hash browns I began to bubble myself! In a good way of course! \n\nThe combination of the QUALITY ingredients and the simplicity of the items made everything we ate a joy. This is a trait I have seen through most of Europe and hopefully the trend is coming here. Quality and simplicity are king! \n\nNow the trick is to somehow get back to Phoenix. Foiled again, I knew there was a catch to this place!	3	3	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	0QdwQLVxZpgy9Qb2Qakflw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
ip1hwHIuDKnUajaFUqni6Q	5	2012-03-10 00:00:00	I was first introduced to Matt's Big Breakfast when I was a resident of Flagstaff, AZ, where waiting for a good breakfast is an everyday part of life.  I know that some people in Phoenix will not be able to wait, since they have their Denny's and Waffle Houses in their neighborhood.\n\nWith that said, Matt's Big Breakfast is worth the wait.  Waiting is good for you.  And the wait is usually not that long.  And, while you are waiting, there is stuff to look and see and do!  The Downtown Public Market is adjacent to Matt's, the people at the Coronado Hotel are pretty cool after you give them a cigarette or "shfifty shents".  \n\nThe staff is always in a rush but as pleasant as cherubs.  The coffee smells delightful, and the honey lemonade is the bees knees  The food is the best part! I love the ingredients that Matt picks, which are local and organic when the product is convenient, affordable, or rockstar status.  All the eggs are from local cage free chickens.  All of the jams and jellies (which rotate on a daily basis) are from local businesses and they will probably help relieve any allergies you have (if you live in Phoenix).  When I was a young Big Breakfast eater, I enjoyed the Five Spot and worked my way up to the to the succulent egg and pork Chop and Chick before graduating to simply ordering the special, and trusting that Matt and his minions will take care of me.\n\nThe specials are the reason why I keep coming back, and why I bring my friends.  I have brought out of town poets, musicians, and artists to Matt's.  They all love the diner feel, the orange and simple menu, the nice and friendly staff, and of course - the BIG breakfast.	4	0	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	itveunhkoCwFOlqOaFlupw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

This is coming from the guy who plans cross-country road trips to get my lips on some of the food I see Triple-D.  Sorry Matt's, you kind of fell short on this one.  The wait was way too long for breakfast, although I guess the place is famous now so it's to be expected.  \n\nInside, there were definitely more staff than diners, yet we seemed to be invisible.  We waited forever to get menus, drink and food orders, etc.  The staff were friendly enough and apologized once realizing how long we waited, but come on - it's breakfast, and there are all of what, 5 tables in the whole place?\n\nThe food was fantastic, no way to argue that.  Just a little over-priced for the experience that we didn't end up getting.  \n\nWould I go back again?  Yeah, if someone came cross-country on a Fieri food frenzy and demanded it.  Otherwise, I would stick to a little more down-to-earth kind of place, which I bet this once was.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	VWDL0VgQ2ivpN3oYhL_WsA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Those of us who haven't had the pleasure of dining at Matt's thought we knew a good pancake... WRONG!  Matt's is where it's at, 1/2 hr-1 hr wait and all (We were seated in 1/2hr Tuesday @ 10am).  \n\nThe restaurant is very busy, so one cannot expect the servers to build rapport with the customer.  Rather it's more important they keep my coffee and OJ full with a smile, which they did well.\n\nI had the ribeye, eggs and home fries, which was one of the specials of the day.  While my steak was cooked medium when I requested medium-rare, it was delicious, well cooked and seasoned to perfection.  \nEggs over easy done text-book as well, fresh, hot and you can't get any better.\n\nThe portions on most of the orders seemed small, so we had to order some sides which drove up the bill total.  The menu can be inexpensive if you just order one thing, but there are so many great things to try!.. like the fresh strawberry preserves!\n\nHands down this is best breakfast gem in Arizona and I can't wait until we can go back!	3	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	tjmqE-70kkNO3oadBd7ZRQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
It3-FecICAlZitdb4n8-IA	4	2007-12-28 00:00:00	Don't go if you are in a hurry but definitely go if you're really hungry. I went on a Saturday morning and waited about 45 minutes. The servers were really friendly and not pushy even though you know they have a line of people waiting outside. I had the griddlecakes and my (very picky) friend had the salami scramble which he devoured. The food was really good, but I wasn't floored like I expected from what I've heard. I will definitely return though, it's a fun place to take people who don't venture to Phoenix much from the suburbs or are from out of town.	4	0	4	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Y5BDvzFOe2NbVmgmLd3H3g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
iu0VLJ153d5ak4QZtHudZw	2	2009-09-08 00:00:00	After hearing so many positives about Matts Big Breakfast, I decided after retrieving my friend from the airport to go and get my breakfast on! Love at first sight , no!! But never judge a book by it's cover, right? Huh, maybe... Parking is minimal, and in that part of the city.. It can be dicey to find parking . The place is tiny.. Tinier & more cramped with dreadful decor... Much like Over Easy, in fact! There are a handful of basic breakfast selections.. With catchy names though.. I ordered the 'hog & chick' for example.. Only bc I wanted to have poached eggs.. That was     just the easiest way to get them& I passed my 'hog' on to my hungry hog\n\nloving friend... The eggs are free range &  were perfectly poached, score ! Finally some chef in the desert got my poach correct... I'm very picky on the poach... Not like it's a hard process, I know as I have the calphelon pan for poaching in my own loft! I loved my home fries.. Big nice wedges of potatoes.. Sidenote -- too many Rosemary stems.. For me and my built in retainer , it could become a toothy disaster ! And whoa with the onions... Yikes ! Great for flavor, but not unless your planning on being amongst the masses following breakfast! There were a ton of big slivers of white onion.. But once your past picking all the flavor adding things out,you have great home fries..my friend has the hashbrowns, she said they reminded her of OreIda with alot of grease...I've never been a fan of shredded potatoes seemingly devised to soak up oil from the pan , so I wouldn't test them... Loved the bread... Wow! Homemade jams too.. Yum! There was no fruit on the plate.. It's presented in a basic diner way.. I personally like some fruit when I go down the breakfast path.. Relatively inexpensive.. Coffee , nothing special & no options for espresso ... Thot I was going to have a small panic attack over that alone... One other disappointment... Restroom?? No.. It's next door in a divey looking motel with wooden shutters ... I'll wait & use the Starbucks restroom as I drive home disappointed and needing espresso fast.. I'm thinking I'm seriously picky with my breakfast/brunch & just unable to find a 4star option here.. Oh well, I fly for free... I'm goin back to Cali..	2	2	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	1sGYXSkJHPhJ6wQtc-RbZw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
IvaZ6hroM611JWjMIYb3Bg	4	2009-07-28 00:00:00	3.5 stars for Matt's. While you can tell that their dishes are made with care and they use quality ingredients (local, when possible), I feel that this place is a little overhyped. The menu is basically glorified Americana diner breakfasts and, while they do it well and with a charm and authenticity rarely found in Phoenix, it's a little boring. Would it hurt to offer some variations of pancakes and waffles?! The pancakes were good - fluffy with a touch of sweetness - but nothing to phone home about. The standout was their breakfast special of the day - a three egg scramble with white cheddar, hot links, and a pepper they described as in between a green chile and a jalapeno. Proably the best egg breakfast dish I've had in a while. As good as it was, though, I can't imagine waiting a half hour or more for it. Luckily we went on a weekday at a good time and had no wait, but I've heard people wait for hours for this food, and it's just not that spectacular. My other complaint is that, for a place with "Big Breakfast" in the name, the portions are no larger than what you'd get at Denny's or IHOP. I'm not a proponent of oversized portions at all - I believe it's wasteful and contributes greatly to our nation's obesity epidemic - but, come on, ya gotta live up to your name. Not only that, but some of the prices are a little steep. $2.50 for the tiniest glass of OJ you've ever seen. Service is great, the place is cute, and the food is good, but the media attention and national recognition on Food Network have overhyped Matt's from what it truly is - a friendly neighborhood spot to grab a good, fresh, hearty breakfast made with care.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	lROh5HIO2jd2VhDOp8yO6w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

My impression here is that folks who rave about this place have never had really good food with flavor. I actually find that a lot in Phoenix...PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW GOOD FOOD HERE!!!! Look at most of the bad reviews and see where most of the people are from. Yeah, not here with exception of myself but I am actually from Los Angeles and have had access all my live to some of the best food around. Matt's big breakfast is a big joke!

jeFJoplSmrF3gvNNyxRq_w	5	2010-01-23 00:00:00	Best...hashed...browns...ever.  (and yes, it's hashED browns, folks.)  I have tried a new brunch place almost on a weekly basis since I moved here in August, and MBB wins the hashed browns contest hands down.  They're so perfectly and proportionately crispy and soft.  DELISH!  Do try!  \n\nI ordered the hog and chick kind of out of necessity since there wasn't a great variety of choices on the menu, but in the end, it didn't matter cuz it was delicious.  I think the thing about MBB is that everything on the small menu is probably awesome, which is why they can afford to keep the menu small.  A nice touch was that they carried the Sunday newspaper, which was perfect since we forgot ours that particular weekend, and that helped to pass the waiting time for our food (which was not bad at all.  maybe 15 minutes.).  \n\nFor all you coffee lovers, the java here is pretty good as well.  In fact, the waitress told us that the owners of MBB just recently opened up a coffee shop somewhere locally, so I'll have to find out where and go.  I just hope I don't have to wait as long as I did to get into MBB to get some coffee.  Truthfully, it wasn't so bad waiting.  I think we only waited about a half hour.  The only downside to MBB is the small space!  You'd think they would want to expand a little, but mayhaps this is part of the allure for us MBB fans.  No pain, no gain. \n\nSidenote: Parking is not the BEST, but if you go early, you should be able to find a spot just fine.  ALSO, note that they do NOT split checks.  Good to know beforehand.	1	0	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	77sBf7U2Heve6AI4Gd0qyg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

One time I woke up randomly at 6:30 on Sunday and went over there just in time not to wait for a ridiculous amount of time. That was nice. It almost motivates me to wake up early more often.

Here's my problem with Matt's: if you order the cheese omelet and have their paltry selection of veggies added to it, you're paying more than you would for a meat omelet.  That's pretty stupid; meat costs more than vegetables, and is a bigger deal to store and prep.  How hard is it to offer a reasonable vegetarian option?  \n\nI've eaten there twice for breakfast and lunch, and quality each time was middling.  The hashbrowns were not good, really slimy and squishy on the inside.  \n\nNot worth the wait.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	3FoZifwueCU8O89nETEH4g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I read the reviews for this place and decided to choose it based on the high rating.\n\nHad eggs, bacon, toast and the OJ. It was easily one of the best breakfasts I've had. When I visit again, I'll go back for sure and highly recommend it to anyone looking for breakfast.\n\nThe price was about right for the organic and natural foods they offer. It's probably a little more than most tiny breakfasts stops, but knowing the food served was chosen from natural food markets, the price was spot on for the quality of food.\n\nThere was a wait because the restaurant was tiny, but well worth the wait. Trust me, definitely swing by this breakfast diner. You'll be glad you did!	2	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	I4d-CbybQS7T__IrlaHOdA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
jZgJ7JwvzYkg87V0WwYMhg	4	2012-07-27 00:00:00	I just went to Phoenix for the first time this past week, and one of the must stop places on my list was this restaurant: Matt's Big Breakfast. This place has been featured on Dinners, Drive-Ins, and Dives on the Food Network. On the third day of our trip, my husband and I went here, despite warnings from my cousin that the wait could take hours. Fortunately for us, we only waited twenty minutes. Upon entering this tiny retro diner, I ordered the special, an egg scramble with thick bacon, fontina cheese, and baby spinach in it. This was accompanied by hash browns, homemade bread and homemade jam. I was very pleased with my choice of meals, it was awesome!! My husband ordered the Hog and Chick. This is a meal that comes with two eggs any style, ham, fresh bread and jam, as well as a choice of hash browns or potatoes. My husband said the ham was incredibly delicious. I tried the potatoes with fresh rosemary and liked those even more than my hash browns. Both of our meals were around $8.00 each. There were not too expensive and they kept us full all day.\nDespite working in tight quarters, the waiters and waitresses were friendly and helpful.\nBecause our overall experience was so good, my husband and I returned here the morning we left for the airport. This time we both had the hog and chick. It was just as good as what I ordered previously. I highly recommend this sweet little joint in the heart of the southwest!!	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Gfz7H31mWCvdgSkzknXL1w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
J_W3BHsKl96P3l_LWUf1Bg	4	2010-09-27 00:00:00	Oh, this place was worth the wait. My friends and I got there at 10:30AM and the wait was about 45min. Thankfully there was a farmers market across the street to keep me busy. \n\nMatt's was very small and there were no bathrooms inside of building. Strange floor plan. I ordered a Cheese Omelet with peppers and ham, coffee, and OJ. The coffee was heavenly...it was what I've been looking for all morning. The OJ was surprisingly tiny...the glass was as tall my fingers, but it was very fresh. The omelet came with a side of home fries or hash browns and bread. I HIGHLY recommend the home fries, which is chopped potatoes cooked with onions and rosemary. I got the wheat bread which was delicious. This is not your typical plain/thin wheat toast!  The omelet was huge and so were the ingredients. The peppers which I thought was be sprinkled in like most places was actually a whole sauteed pepper. The ham was smokey and thick. The serving was pretty good for a $10 breakfast. \n\nOverall, I think Matt's is superior to other popular breakfast joint such as the Breakfast Club or Orange Table. It was worth the wait, but I'll definitely be more strategic regarding the timing the next time around.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	aZ15v5efVH0gzNWWxAK3xA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

On to the food...everyone in our party thought it was great...had the Hog & Chick myself.  The menu prices have gone up from what I saw on-line though...need to update their website!  Ernie (Matt's wife) helped us and was very nice. Overall was worth the wait...about 30 minutes on a Saturday morning.  There is a Farmer's Market across the street that you can check out while waiting :)	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	lf-KW7oMqzKugOUTRTyAGQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The food is delicious, and buttery, and fatty.  But if you know in advance what you're getting in to, there's no room for complaints.  The food isn't healthy to put it mildly, but it's delicious. And it's perfect if you're hungover.  Seriously.  Go have breakfast here, take a nap when you get home and you'll be good to go.  \n\nBe advised that there is quite a wait on the weekends.  I had to wait around 35 minutes the time I went, but after reading all the reviews, I knew what to expect, so I didn't mind it. Good food usually means a considerable wait, so just suck it up and go anyways.  Once you try the food, you'll forget you had to sit outside for 40 minutes.	3	0	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	sYQyXDjGaJj7wfaqz5u8KQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

KcR5ZwfVyAGhlAz0o8GdjQ	2	2011-06-15 00:00:00	I have been hearing rave reviews about this place from all my co-workers, so I decided to give it a go.\n\nI called to place an order and the girl accidentally hung up on me. I don't know why that bothers me so much, maybe it's just because you should know how to operate your phone?\n\nWhen I went to pick up my order the place is busy, as always which is a great thing. It's like going to a Mexican restaurant and seeing Mexicans, it just means the food is good. \n\nI got the omelet with onions and ham, with hash browns and wheat toast. The top half of the hash browns were on point, crisp and tasty. The bottom half . . . soggy and soaked in grease. GROSS. \n\nThe omelet was huge! If you are looking for a lot of food this is the place to go, though if you are looking for taste I would skip the omelet. The only thing that didn't taste like cardboard was the ham. Thank God for the ham. \n\nThe wheat toast was ok, though the spread they include has chunks of fruit in it and is amazing.\n\nDon't order the OJ to go. You get about 3oz. of it in a plastic sippy cup. I don't know if they thought I was heading to the airport? \n\nAnyway, if you want a huge obese enticing portion go here you will get it. If you are looking for a non soggy breakfast I would keep looking.	3	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	h0bBE6IMpcVsuNthcyp2PQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I always stick with the classic bacon and eggs with some coffee, but I've had friends get the sausauge and steak which I tasted to make sure it wasn't poison...and I haven't tried anything that wasn't good! Part of what makes this place so good is the atmosphere. A tiny, trailer-esque diner? Sign me up! If there is a wait they usually have some water or lemonade to sip on while you wait....but the table turnover isn't too long, so it's nothing to complain about.	2	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	pL4NhW3rTokFr-CQh3Lzgg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
kM3FCYE8yytYJxp7kmrGyA	4	2008-08-04 00:00:00	While my friend Austin was here in town, he had wanted to eat at Matt's big breakfast after hearing about it on a travel channel show.  So, we wandered downtown and tried this place for breakfast.\n\nWhen approaching the restaurant, we noticed that parking was limited.  Mostly sidestreet metered parking.  We found an open meter, and went inside.\n\nThe place is really cute from the outside, and crazy small on the inside.  Its more of a simple decor, with orange table tops, and white walls.  We had a small wait, and put our name on the list.\n\nEventually, we sat at the bar after waiting about 15 minutes in the sun. I ordered a cheese omelette, and Austin ordered a cheeseburger.  Both our food came out, and it was tasty!  Service was quick, and we were in and out of there in less then an hour.\n\nO, and a word of advice.  The bathroom here is located in the middle of the kitchen!  I had "to go" while we were waiting, and I was surprised at the whole thing.  the bathroom is teeny tiny, and you have to walk through the kitchen to get to it.  Plus, its located immediately next to the grill!  If you can help it, either "hold it" or go before!  Fair warning for bathroom users!	5	2	4	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	qibGLHABNReGeJr2w4_8yQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

This place has a warm feel to it and the food is AWESOME!  They have daily egg specials that are remarkable.  The Honey Lemonade is fresh and like no other in town.

But now that I've made it inside, I can tell you that the wait is well worth it.\n\nM had it as simple as you can get: A single egg, scrambled. And it was light, fluffy and perfect.\n\nI had the Honey Lemonade and wish I could have it every day. \n\nI also had the waffle & Bacon, both were amazing. The thick cut peppery bacon is soo good. I don't eat a lot of pork; so for me to love bacon, it's a big deal.  The waffle is the best I've ever had. the exterior is perfectly golden brown, and the inside is like eating a cloud.

Kudos to Matt and Erenia for holding true to the idea of making rad, no-frills breakfast food like they do back on the farm.  I don't eat here as often as I'd like, because the lines are impossible and I don't have the time to devote to an hour wait for Saturday or Sunday breakfast, but if the night before was long and I end up sleeping in, I have no shame about grabbing some breakfast at 1:30, and the lines are usually gone by then.  I will miss this place dearly.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	s-QuNG8f5pMHsq3hlqniAQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
kySlHtN93lboIFgh5gqzcA	3	2013-01-24 00:00:00	I've been to Matt's Big Breakfast twice. I was not impressed by the long wait or the atmosphere. It  was small and dingy. The bathroom in the dive hotel next door was really disgusting.\n\nI did enjoy the food though. The first time I got an *egg white and vegetable omelet*, which was ok. It was fresh, which was good. The real stand out for me was the *toast*, they said they said it was local and the bakery sold at the farmers market around the corner. It was really delicious. I also enjoyed the *hashbrowns*, they were greasy but yummy. They used a spice that I couldn't discern. I think it was a little bit of nutmeg. It really popped. \n\nThe second time we went, I got the *egg salad sandwich*. It was well balanced. Same good bread. I got a side of hashbrowns, because I enjoyed them the first time. \n\nMy husband wasn't impressed at all. He thought his omelet was average and didn't really care for the atmosphere.\n\nBecause of the cost, and atmosphere, I don't think we will be returning anytime soon.	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	gh614Mg2VR_ZJxIX8BcIxA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
l1QIB31uo33IQQRNmPtxcQ	5	2010-05-23 00:00:00	It's worth the wait just for the orange juice - but the food is good too.\n\nThe boys went camping, so my daughter and I woke up early and headed downtown for the farmer's market and some breakfast. We stopped at Matt's long enough to put our name on the list and then ventured across the street to meander through all the local wares. We took our time and when we came back, we met and visited a couple of moms who had brought their daughters all the way from Calgary to try this place. (wow)\n\nHere's what we figured out about the wait: it's about 30-40 minutes per page of names ahead of you... (ish) Two pages of names ahead of us when we signed in = 1 hour 10 minutes total wait on the day we went.\n\nOnce inside, I loved the quaintness of the place ( and our service was superb. It's also obvious that they recognize people who have been in before and sometimes even know their names.\n\nBeing somewhat indecisive, we ordered the cheese omelet and the belgian waffle and shared. The omelet had just the right amount of cheese, making it a perfect accompaniment to the oh-my-gosh! fabulous wheat toast with locally made strawberry preserves. The hashbrowns were nothing to get excited about, but in the nirvana of the previously mentioned last bite, who cares?!?\n\nBut wait. Then I tried the waffle.\n\nOne of my best friends and I make waffles all the time - and have been making them for years. She's know for hers. I'm really sorry, dear friend, but Matt's has you beat. Their belgian is the ultimate experience of amazingness with just the right combination of being fluffy without being soggy. Add the 100% maple syrup and I'm good... so very very good. There's no need for the sweet cream butter - but it's there if you want it.\n\nIf they could pick the perfect orange at the moment of ultimate ripeness and squeeze it into a glass, you might be able to imagine the essence of every sip of the juice we drank. Just for kicks, we ordered the honey lemonade. Not really a breakfast beverage, but a must have for when we go back for lunch.\n\nGo knowing that you will wait and that it will be worth every minute. Definitely looking forward to going back.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	V0cLzrv-LSuOHs0-RWhBbQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
l5Jg8yR8jfJdpem0nV076Q	5	2009-08-31 00:00:00	Being in the Navy, I've faced two-hour lines for some of the worst meals our galley slaves can conjure up, since the other option was "starve", and walked away hungry. Back home in Phoenix, though, I'll happily pace back and forth for two hours outside Matt's Big Breakfast because I know in the end it'll be worth the wait.\n\nBreakfast on a fall morning is a particular treat due to the presence of seasonal apple cider, which is phenomenal. Same with the blackberry preserves served with your side of toast. On my first visit, I ordered the day's special, an omelet stuffed with spinach and mushrooms, though couldn't help snitching from my mom's plate--she'd ordered the Chop and Chick, eggs served with a perfectly browned pork chop. The hash browns--my god. Studded with deposits of melted cheese that oozed out with every poke of my fork. Amazing.\n\nI've only been once for lunch, but I can say without hyperbole that the Big Butter Burger is the best cheeseburger I've ever had. Cooked in rich creamery butter that calls to mind a particular episode of the Simpsons. BEST CORONARY EVER. I couldn't even complain about the presence of chips as opposed to french fries.\n\nI really don't get the reviews dismissing Matt's as "meh", I'd love to know what heavenly manna these people consume the rest of the time	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	UWftmIXUSRwgW8DEa57KzA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

LACw1u8Q3gaaXCpejjQg9w	4	2010-02-18 00:00:00	You gotta love Matts Big Breakfast...a simple menu with the freshest ingredients, good service, and a cozy down home setting that makes you feel like you're eating in Grandma's kitchen. We got lucky on our last visit b/c it was later in the day and drizzling outside, so there was no wait at all and we got right in. I don't think I would try to go here during peak hours on a Saturday or Sunday morning, unless you like waiting a while to get seated. \n\nWe ordered the Salami Scramble (good) and the Waffle (great), along with a side of bacon. Their bacon is definitely one of the best in all of Phoenix, that's for sure. It's flavorful and juicy and crisp all at the same time. \n\nI don't think I would change a thing about this place, except for the sketchy location that it is in. It's kind of artsy fartsy and trendy on the one hand, but then on the other hand there are about 5 crack dens surrounding it. Let's just say I wouldn't want to be there alone at night.....hence why it is a breakfast place I guess. We actually experienced some of the shadiness first hand when we went to the hotel next door to go pee after our meal (no bathroom in the place). There was a torn up hooker in her 50's arguing with the lady at the check in desk about money with some guy who was missing all of his front teeth. There was obviously something illegal about to do down in one of the rooms, so we peed as quickly and quietly as we could and left the scene before we could get shot. Even so, getting shot is definitely worth the risk for some of their delicious food!	8	10	8	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	9Lskp3870EP6fGbI9V6ZMQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

lgTUHJje-oI07Ca2JeCmNg	4	2007-01-04 00:00:00	For some reason, we hit Phoenix on the first rainy day since October but that did not deter us from checking out Matt's Big Breakfast based on all the Yelp raves.  We had to wait outside for about 10-15 minutes in the rain, but finally got two seats at the bar.  When people describe this place as tiny, think 8 small tables and 6 bar stools tiny.  Do not try with groups...it will not work.\n\nThe waitress behind the counter was a riot telling people to "Smile, it's Christmas!"  She definitely kept the spirits up.  Our service was great, but we were at the counter where coffee was readily available.  First impression was that the coffee was great.  It is local, fresh and delicious.  My husband's waffle was really good but I won with the cheese omelette with mushrooms, onion and bacon.  It was full of gooey cheese and my husband helped me polish it off.  The hashbrowns were good, but a little greasy and the sourdough was perfect.  \n\nBottom line - it is worth the trek downtown if you are on vacation or do not live downtown.  Good simple breakfast with plenty of butter for you arteries to soak up.	1	1	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	R0KVWeN9xR-F6j4z5k9wXQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Ernie lights up the room with her smile. Once that happens, the coffee is served, and the service begins then the rest of the breakfast is just a wonderful continuation. Peg and I went for my birthday (actually, we try to extend family occasions so that we can visit the family of chefs with whom we have grown since we moved here in '97). The OJ was fresh, the specials are always superb, and there is a continuity in the kitchen that virtually assures that the quality will be stellar.

I took my nieces with me and I wasn't sure if it was very kid friendly...let's say I wouldn't bring young ones there just because it is so small and there is no room to run around.  But since my gals are 10 and 11 there was no problem accommodating them.  They split the delicious belgian waffle.  Let me tell you this is the tastiest I have ever tried!!  Real maple syrup is the key and they serve the best.  All piping hot and fresh off the griddle (my mouth waters just thinking of it).  I ordered the egg sandwich with no bacon, so it was a fried egg with american cheese and sauteed onions.  Not the healthiest option but I really enjoyed it.  I am not sure what kind of bread it was on but it was soft and fantastic.  The fresh squeezed OJ is like eating a ripe orange and the coffee was very well made.  All in all I can see why people are willing to wait for a long time to eat here.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	9fV1WYZ-JUDuxsFMEh9bbg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Mine was during a rare Arizona downpour, but even so, it was well worth it.  I waited about half an hour, sharing an umbrella with strangers.  When it was time to be seated, I was asked "are you ready, honey?" by a woman who might have been half my age, if that.  Even though the place was cramped and extremely busy, all of the staff were friendly and accommodating.  Not long after being seated, I was poured the first of what turned out to be four cups of delicious, freshly-ground coffee, at which time my order was also taken.  I had the special - 3 scrambled eggs with locally-raised ham, roasted red peppers, and provolone cheese.  It arrived promptly, and was savored thoroughly.  I'm leaving Phoenix in less than 48 hours, but I'm definitely planning a return visit.	2	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	56K_9wpkZXLWziojc2Mk0w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Well worth the wait and one of the best not so hidden gems in town.  There is only one thing keeping me from 5 stars.  Tabasco... really?  In my humble opinion, a breakfast restaurant with no Cholula or Tapatio is missing the essentials.  Tabasco is bush league and Matt ... that is one thing you are not.  Your wife is hispanic, right??  C'mon brother - ditch the tabasco and get the real stuff.  Even your cooks keep a stash of the good stuff.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	58r_jKzlNBtIg2ZZLsCjiA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
M3cuM2kMDtC5DLqzexUJgA	4	2008-04-21 00:00:00	I had an excellent meal here.  There were two of us and we arrived at about 7:30am on a Saturday.  We waited only 25 minutes.  We could have been seated at the counter sooner but decided to wait for a table.  The service was EXCELLENT.  For the type of  food you get here it did take longer than expected to be brought to our table though.  My omlette was cooked perfectly, the wheat toast was outstanding.  I was expecting traditional home fries but was surprised when they brought me Yukon Gold potatoes cut up and lightly browned with olive oil and rosemary.  The bacon was also cooked just right.  I also tried a couple of bites of their waffle which was good and I will most likely order that next time.  While it is a small place, you do not feel to cramped inside nor is it too loud to have a conversation across the table.   Portions are a good size and for both of us the bill was $20.00.	2	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	rL1Iozf8bfVKCoBDxhpSBg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The three of us ordered grass fed steak and eggs, the pork chop and egg, the bacon and home fries... all were delicious!  The wheat bread came with their home made strawberry preserves.  \n\nGreat for an american breakfast spot!	0	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Us3ZuNZvLTK5FEvs6aABCw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
mC8OKUf4aPQYoO9PULWJpA	3	2010-02-27 00:00:00	My husband and I made it to the Farmer's Market early on a Saturday, which is quite a feat, so we decided to reward ourselves with breakfast across the street.  We'd heard great things about Matt's and I always see a crowd of people waiting outside.   He waited for our table while I shopped across the way at the farmer's market.  While he was waiting he went inside and asked for a cup of coffee.  He was told that they only sell coffee with to-go orders, so he asked for a coffee "to go".  He was turned down, so he walked across the street to the farmer's market and bought some coffee from a stand.  When our table was ready, they made him stand outside to finish his coffee because they have a strict "no outside food or drink" rule.  Pretty lame.  As far as the food, I had an omelet with spinach, mushrooms, and fontina cheese.  My husband had an omelet with hard salami.  While the food was good, it wasn't anything I couldn't have made at home.  The star of the meal was the locally made fresh strawberry preserves, but nobody told us that was coming and it didn't go too well with my husband's sourdough toast.  A heads up would have been nice.\n\nI think part of the allure of this place is the fact that there is almost always a crowd of people waiting outside.   There's very little chance I'll ever join them.  I'll stick to the breakfast gyros and free samples across the way at the farmer's market.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	NIHuPRTp7Ff9DwyT2XPONg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
me5trRtitoEDNE9tuEtvuw	5	2013-04-17 00:00:00	The first time I came here (their old location) I sat outside and waited for an hour and a half in the pouring rain. I had biked over, so I literally had nowhere indoors to sit and wait.\n\nAlthough I was hangry (adjective: angry from hunger), soaking wet and slightly impatient (this was back before they offered wait times), it was worth it.\n\nMatt's hash browns are perfectly crisp and golden. The eggs are rich and delicious, unlike the ones you find in chain grocery stores. The coffee (from a local roaster) is clean, fresh and bright. Their 5 Spot sandwich is a perfect sampling of all their delicious breakfast offerings, and the simple Hog n Chick is a fresh, local take on a classic egg and ham breakfast.\n\nI would recommend Matt's Big Breakfast to absolutely everyone.\n\nTip: If you don't want to wait for half an hour to 45 minutes, come between 7:45 and 8:15 nearly any morning of the week. The wait will be ~5 minutes, and you'll be leaving just as people begin to pile up!	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	6wQ-jgk9nPlt-_5iSHWKew	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The bacon has this special seasoning that goes nicely on it. One of the best hash browns I ever had. Long wait but worth it, the waiters are average they all work together which they try very hard to speed things up. 4.5.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	aIdtOiLjNMFTexCCH7V2vg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
MHGCs3rURv4L8rapg-p7dA	5	2009-05-04 00:00:00	My husband and I were visting Phoenix this past week. We looked on Yelp for a recommendation for a great breakfast place that wasn't far from our hotel downtown. \n\nBoy were we happy we found Matts! It was Thursday morning and the wait was only about 10 minutes. The restaurant is small and lively. The service was fast and friendly. And the food was FANTASTIC!\n\n I got the H & C - with delicious thick cut peppered bacon and fluffy scrambled eggs. The hashbrowns were delicous and the thick slices of sourdough toast with raspberry preserves completed the meal. The coffee was also very good. My husband had the salami scramble and thought it was very tasty as well. \n\nMatt's was one of the highlights of our week!	2	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	v_8GyxeeuO9MiVZcqW7U_Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
MJLbImlp2mkBkWf9Xhjtmw	3	2010-04-04 00:00:00	I thought the food was really good here. I went just like everyone else because of Diners, Drive-in's and Dives and some other local input. I can't even tell you how long we waited. It was unbelievable. The quality was good and the price was great. I would have given it 4 stars if we didn't wait outside for at least 2 hours. The place only holds like 5 tables so the service better be good. We have not been back because it's hard to justify that length of time waiting to eat.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	-NV5_GlekzoPB2aZCs6kDQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
MJzE0pkgWcNqkCV3-wV2Rg	5	2010-11-01 00:00:00	Matt's was absolutely fantastic. Got there at 2pm on a Sunday, which is apparently the time to do it (half an hour before close), as we walked right in, sat right down, and had food in 5 minutes or less. Brilliant.\n\nI had the Five Spot which was simply the best egg sandwich I have ever had. Two eggs, two huge slices of perfectly cooked bacon, american cheese (my favorite with eggs when I'm not going fancy-style, reminds me of when I was a kid), and well grilled onions round it out, served on a fantastic roll. \n\nBy default, this item doesn't include the normal potatoes and toast, so I had them add homefries--they were magnificent, and entirely unnecessary. A huge portion of them, with a wonderful smattering of rosemary to punch them up, they were delicious, but I couldn't finish them.\n\nThe girlfriend got a waffle with bacon and it should just be said that restaurants who serve waffles without real maple syrup are simply criminal. Matt's brings the good stuff, and it's MUCH appreciated. Perfect for dipping both waffle and bacon alike. The waffle was fluffy, light, and had that good, homemade flavor.\n\nI can't get over how filling and delicious my sandwich was. Service was prompt and friendly, and overall, it was a great experience. Added a glass of OJ and a coffee to my sandwich with added homefries and her bacon and waffles bringing our tab to right about $21. Absolutely worth every penny. Will be coming back. Probably near 2 o'clock again, to avoid the wait!	2	0	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	2AZaPPRAWhDDO7k-jlpfwg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
MLklfcjStb9zY8l4DWb-Aw	2	2008-01-07 00:00:00	So, it was 7:22 a.m. on the first Saturday of 2008 when we walked into Matt's Big Breakfast.  The place was maybe half full when we were taken to a table for two with a seat on the side.  A friendly waiter came by for drink orders; I went with apple juice but was later informed they were out.  The whole order went a little something like this, 2 coffees, 1 milk, 1 waffle, 1 cakes, and 1 special of ham eggs green chili and cheese scramble.  I hear the coffee was drinkable.  The waffle and pancakes had somewhat of a buckwheat taste but not sure if that is what they actually were.  I am a huge fan of Belgium waffles and found myself terribly disappointed.  I see a Belgium waffle as having a slight crisp of an edge and a soft center.  This waffle was very soft with no crisp and almost like a moist sponge.  The special was not the best and the pancakes seemed pretty heavy.  The home fries seemed like they were cooked in bacon grease and maybe sat there too long.  I did like the small quaint feel of the restaurant.  All of the staff was very friendly and worked together.  People of all styles came for breakfast, there were regulars, people in a hurry for the airport, couples, families, singles, people of all kinds.  They all were all asked, "How is the food?"  They all seemed to enjoy.  At the places prime they could probably seat 24 people, give or take.  I will probably not be one of them, but I am glad I was one once.	4	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	z9YGQ3jA9-IjcKWYrOTkdw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

But... it's breakfast.  I know that big chains can somehow screw it up, but for the most part, it's not that difficult to pull off. \n\nThis is one of the better places I've had breakfast... Maybe it was the hype, maybe the wait in the cold rain, or maybe it was just the food.  \n\nWas it worth waiting in the rain for an hour?  No.  Was it worth waiting an hour without the rain?  No.  Was it some tasty breakfast?  Yes.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	lnERjRtMzDPRIUkaKJJACA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

MSdZnTjsz27qRWoNPEE6SQ	1	2008-04-10 00:00:00	OVERRATED.\n\nI know it was reviewed on Food network channel as top 10 something or another in the nation.  Did their quality go down since they know that people will seek it out irregardless of the review?\n\nLocation- in down town Phoenix- but in a crappy part that doesn't look safe at night.  Dirt lot in back is not an option to park because of city ordinances or safety issues.\n\nWait time- for those reviewers who waited over 1hour in the hot desert sun- i don't know what to say. There is little to no shade, it's hot, you lean on wooden fences... it's a strange system where you sign your name to be called. However, if you sign in, and say you want to go do something else instead of wait an hour in the hot sun, they will cross you off the list if you aren't there for roll call. Some people behind us, just waited a bit then walked in and sat at the bar (where they were seating other people).  And they say they don't play favorites?  Please....  If you can't stand to wait, you can  order take out and get your food before all the other people waiting.  Do they let anyone know? NO. Do they care that people waiting over 1 hour have to wait another hour for food so To-Go people can get their food? NO...\n\nFood- maybe the food tastes better because your out in the hot sun,dehydrating, standing, waiting... because the food didn't look like anything special and didn't taste special either.  Just run of the mill breakfast food.  Does it take 45min to make waffles and toast?  We told them we had a flight to catch, and our food took a crazy amount of time to make. No wonder the wait is so long outside! 2oz of OJ was $2.50\n\nAmbiance- it's a 3 room (1 kitchen, one bar set up, 1 room with 4 tables and seating on bar-like thing looking outside. Think they can seat ~20 people inside?  Poor decor, crappy furniture.... they must make a ton of money because none of it is going into the location/upkeep/decor.\n\nDon't even think about coming here with more than 6 people.... Where will you put them? Wait til the restaurant clears so you have a room to yourself?  ha...\n\nOnce again, OVER-RATED.	1	2	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	FSl6qeRIu7kPQfZpBl1Npg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

If you dont have the patience to wait for quality food, call ahead or go to Denny's. Their portions are very large, and honestly I don't get why that is a complaint, get a togo box and enjoy the rest of your lunch or breakfast later.\n Everyone is always friendly who works there and you have to respect the fact that almost all of there food is locally sourced.	1	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	bdoNz7NpcrzAkrw6gKCpfA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

MxoxabB9r6F9P3hdxiXGTg	3	2011-11-11 00:00:00	I think there was way...too much hype for this little place. The food is good, but it wasn't worth waiting over an hour to eat here. I was lucky enough to have come by here and while waiting I walked over to the Farmer's Market, it helped kill my waiting time and standing in the heat. \nNo joke that the place is tiny. They do have a friendly staff and have lots of staff to help with the crowds they get. So the service is good.\nI had The Chop & Chick, the chop was pretty tasty. The homefries were just okay, the hash browns tasted better. I also tried The Five Spot and it was good. There are lots of great reviews on the bacon from this place and...it is good, but I wouldn't want to pay $2.50 for a side order of bacon.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	PaUcJDgJX3pEbCIFX0R5fw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Bacon, Bacon, Bacon is what keeps me coming back to Matt's Big Breakfast and of course their pancakes, pork chops, omelets, hash browns, home fries...\n\nThis place is small as many Yelpers have stated already and no thanks to Guy and his "Triple D" it's hard to find the right time to come to Matt's with out having to wait due to all the foodie followers of Food Network.  \n\nThe service at Matt's is what you make of it. If your in a rush, let your server know and she will accommodate you, but if you don't say anything you'll wait for refills. \n\nAs many Yelpers have already stated their food is amazing!  Matt uses the freshest ingredients, most of which are organic and locally grown.  I had something not on their normal menu: scrambled eggs with sliced chorizo, jalapeños and cheesy goodness with a side of their hash browns, toast and of course bacon!  It was FANTASTIC! Great combination and it wasn't spicy at all!  Ask for it when you go, you must try it!! They bacon and chorizo are made special for Matt at a market.  He uses Wildflower's bread and the egg and veggies are all from local farmers.\n\nRecommendation:  Stacy C is right, the best time to come is during the week and in the early or late morning.  Plan a business breakfast in lieu of a luncheon.  We went last week and the three of us had problem finding a table, be it a small table : -)	7	5	5	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	0mKUbIUXOvH0cHcGQ1KGqg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
m_eb3upOU6nQezwxOdyrEA	4	2007-07-28 00:00:00	The food at Matt's Big Breakfast is pretty great. I defy you to find a better omelette anywhere in town.  However...\n\nI don't know why they had to go ahead and screw up perfectly good food with such terrible service.  Do not go to Matt's if you are thirsty. It takes forever to get your drinks and forget about re-fills. The waiters all act like you are bothering them if you ask for anything. The act like the good food gives them carte blanche to drop the ball on service entirely. Also - STOP using so much OIL. Yucky!\n\n***Edited on 10/07 to add the following: The staff at Matt's must be reading all the Yelp's about their poor service because I went back there today and they were really NICE! It was the first time they have ever been so attentive, quick and nice. And they were not just nice to me. They were nice to everyone. It was awesome! There is one kind of bitchy, slow, mean waitress who was not there today - so maybe everyone is in a better mood on her day off. I hope this trend of excellent service at Matt's continues. It it does I will re-Yelp with only positive things to say. Except...still...chill out with the oil!	5	1	4	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	m2xXzkkKFxzx_yG29y3q8A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
N0PF6cex0FwIigckQoxS1Q	3	2012-01-21 00:00:00	Let's be positive.  Matt's has the best waffles I have ever had. And the pancakes are pretty darn amazing. \n\nBut, Matt's has too many rules. Especially for a diner-style resturant. I feel like every time I go there, I leave being pissed off about something.\n\nFirst, NO substituions.  I'm a vegetarian and most of their dishes come with a side a meat.  I would rather have a side of potatoes (and that is cheaper for the resturant than a side of meat). But, NO substituions. I have to order "no meat" and then pay for a side of potatoes. C'mon, now.\n \nAlso, NO outside beverages.  Matt's is located in an epicenter of amazing local coffee shops.  I would like to enjoy a handcrafted latte from Lola's instead of Matt's drip with breakfast - but the waitress will jump on your butt about that coffee cup before you even sit down.\n \nLoosen up, Matt. It's a diner.\n\nAwesome tip: Matt's does take-out orders. If you're craving some yummy pancakes on a Sunday morning and have no desire to stand outside for 90 minutes - call it in! It will be ready in 15 minutes and you can enjoy a local latte with it!	8	2	5	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	U8m0BamO3PIF29QoLjGFhw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

n1Xm02swJBKLJ4x4c3Rqpw	2	2010-05-17 00:00:00	We decided that we would take in another great breakfast this Saturday at Matt's.  The food again was awesome that is not my beef.  We arrived at 0600 and our course there was no one else there since they still didnt open until 0630.  The employees were busy getting ready for the day.  Meanwhile some other customers started showing up and it seemed that a few of them knew each other so they must be regulars there.  \n\nThe door opened and 0630 and a young blond lady invited us in with the others that were waiting.  This is were it happened!   I walked in the door and chose a table to the right and was informed that "that table is set for three".   WTF??    We were the first people in the door and anyone who has ever eaten knows that it is open seating and if seats are not available then you put your name on a notebook sheet of paper by the door and wait.  So, we sat down and watched three "men"  cruise over to the table "set for three"....   I guess that they get prefered seating over other customers.   I know it sounds petty but the tone of little blondy completely pissed me off.......  I dont think it was right and I think her tone was rude and you could tell she really didnt care what we thought about it..\n\nI will think again before returning to eat here.   There are a lot of choices alot closer to home for breakfast.	3	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	IRcxlU428HsFYtp1JtiPYA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
n3V037o5DE1JTaa6sDwqeA	5	2012-04-06 00:00:00	I arrived in Phoenix from San Francisco and was starving so I Yelp'ed breakfast joints in the area and Matt's Big Breakfast was one of the places with the most quality reviews so I said why not?\n\nUpon arriving there were a number of small parties waiting outside so I knew it was going to be a long wait. Me and my sister ended up waiting an hour as the morning Phoenix sun started creeping up on us. We were able to sit at the counter which was awesome because I was able to see Matt cook in the kitchen. I ordered the hog and chick which consisted of scrambled eggs, fat slices of bacon, hash brown and wheat toast. In addition I ordered the orange juice which was freshly squeezed. The toast is freaking amazing! Best toast I've ever had! The homemade jam was tasteful because it didn't taste like the nasty jam you would get at normal diners. The hash brown was perfect! Crispy brown on the top and bottom and juicy in the inside. The hash brown was the best I've had because it wasn't dry which makes eating that much more enjoyable. The bacon... It was freaking delicious! 4 fat slices of bacon. Yum! I rarely finish my breakfast but I surprisingly finished the hog and chick plate at Matt's.\n\nI will most definitely be back if I'm ever in then phoenix area. This is the best breakfast joint in Arizona and maybe the west coast. Try it out but beware of the wait.	4	1	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	IvDmbTPZkKGepGLj5W8asg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
nagyh0VyuE7JPG-MkD_1IQ	3	2013-01-14 00:00:00	3.5 stars!\n\nThere is a huge hype about this place. It was featured on tv. I get there early to eat here with my brother in law and there was a half hour wait. While we were waiting, a huge line started forming to the outside of the restaurant around 8:30am on a Friday. \n\nMy brother in law had the special of the day, which was a chipotle jalepeno sausage and cheddar scramble served with potatoes and a tortilla instead of toast. I ordered the Salami scramble. I liked his dish because the chipotle sausage was spicy and full of flavor! My Salami scramble was good, but on the salty side. The salami was cut similar to fries, in long rectangular thick pieces. For some reason, I expected thin slices, but it was good all the same. The "home fries" looked more like a hashbrown cassarole and were much, much better than the regular breakfast potatoes. The home fries were my favorite part about being there, more than the salami scramble itself. \n\nThe side of sourdough toast that came with my meal was impressive. The toast appeared to be nearly 2 inches thick, and that was a single slice! It was served with a savory homemade marmalade. \n\nThe owner and the servers there were very friendly, and despite the chaos of the line of people waiting and people constantly checking to see if a spot opened up yet, the staff handled it very well! That alone I give them 4 stars. \n\nFor being a big breakfast, I'd say that my dish was just the "right portion size for me." For some place with big breakfast in the title, if the portion is just right for me, that means that the dish is on the smaller side. \n\nAfter telling about my experience to another friend, who adores this restaurant, I guess I was supposed to order the pancakes, because they are ridiculously good. I've yet to experience those pancakes. If I'm in the area, I will definitely stop by this place again and give it another try, but I'm not sure if it's worth the 40 minute drive from where I live to wait another hour to get a table once I get there, so that's why I took away half a star, but I still really like the place.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	eAJ3Ip0vh-zuk_BmcmchYA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
NAoKiQXPMLI7uLPZFczZ-g	4	2009-10-29 00:00:00	I must say that this place was pretty darned good. They open at 6:30 AM on Sunday and there was already a line. The whole place was full upon the doors opening, great sign. They have a very small menu but it certainly covers all of your breakfast needs.\n\nI opted for three sides, a pancake, rosemary homestyle potatoes and rye toast with jam. I asked my waitress which to order, the hashbrowns or the homestyle potatoes and she steered me towards my final choice. I'm glad I listened to her as they were delicious, covered with onions, olive oil and rosemary, the were cooked perfectly. They were some of the freshest potatoes I've had for breakfast in a long time. They weren't greasy at all. I felt like I had just gone to the Farmers' Market, chopped these up and cooked them myself for a Sunday brunch at home.\n\nThe pancake was good, nothing outside the ordinary. You can tell by the photo that there wasn't too much love in making it. For some reason the syrup was very good, I'm not quite sure what they used, it was a pancake syrup but obviously not the generic diner variety. The rye and jam were fantastic, just look at how thick the slice was cut, I've never seen a rye like that. I wish other places would serve their breads like this. I'd be a huge fan of any place that cut their slices in this manner.\n\nI would certainly go out of my way to eat here again. The staff were terrific, the place was spotless, the owner walked around and spoke with all diners (it seemed like everyone was a local) and the food was great. The prices have risen, at least since their website has been in place but it's still a good deal (the $5 Spot is now $5.75). A great place to grab a Big Breakfast in a nice atmosphere.\n\nI have photos and a more in depth review on my personal blog.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	szwcIizcup-Cxc9JybCpDw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
Nc09BT-Kid3BF39hglSprA	1	2008-07-14 00:00:00	I heard lots of good stuff regarding this place so I decided to check it out and here's what I concluded\n\n1. Space: first of all this place is really, really, really tiny so sitting situations are way too close for comfort.  I recommend small party with 4 people max.\n\n2. Menu: just because its listed does not mean its available.\n\n3. Quality: not so great, my hash browns were burnt (more like hash blacks) and the rest of the food too greasy. I myself is not a big fan of Fat.\n\n4. Beverage: uh, I rather go to Circle K and get a cup.\n\n5: Service: ok, but for such a limited customers how can service go wrong?\n\n\n\nAll in all I was not impress with this place.  I even went back for lunch thinking maybe it was only during breakfast that this place lacked the hype that everybody was talking about, but once again I very disappointed.  \n\nBTW i like my Burger with Butter and not Butter with Burger.	6	3	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Bvofk-gNzMxX-CyBZ7d5Lw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
NEdWTQG8W5vSn9IR_jxVSw	3	2009-01-12 00:00:00	Because of the name of the restaurant and the line outside, I gained certain expectations. I was expecting a BIG BREAKFAST and amazing tasting food. However, I was disappointed. \n\nI had the Chop and Chick with home fries. This item was not worth the wait or the price. The serving size was small. The taste was forgettable. \n\nI also had the Waffle, which saved the experience. I have to admit it was tasty. I love a waffle where the batter is sweet and doesn't need too much syrup. Also, it came with a slice of bacon, which had a kick to it making it super good. Lastly, it was decently priced. I was close to saying that it's worth the wait, but I found out it's not too hard to make a similar waffle at home by just adding malt to your waffle mix. \n\nThis wouldn't be my first choice for breakfast, but if you're like me and you like to try places featured on the Food Network, just order the bacon. It's unique and different.	2	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	xA_upwVTOVtXkS0NGISGng	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
nHeJOs8ZZ2hSqxNAmMEsNg	5	2011-01-25 00:00:00	Obviously I've been here for breakfast.  I got the steak and eggs and I was amazed.  This amazement isn't from the steak or the eggs, even though they were both delicious, but it was with the toast.  I have never had such great toast before, and the jam was so fresh....\n\nThe wait was long, and we were there in July.  Limited shade outside, but at least they had a water jug for the people waiting.  I recommend preparing for the heat if you decide to go during the summer.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	uZjadWrDiw1Z2ZYbgCJHmQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The restaurant itself and the menu are really simple, breakfast staples, but they are done so well that they taste better! All ingredients are local and organic.   I always try to do the "special", which is usually a type of scramble.  Always delicious!  There are only about 7 tables in the whole place, so I left off a star for the wait you will see on the weekends.  However, it is 100% worth the wait!	2	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	YKNsFxoj6lGR7Sm2do7XSw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
NJn6q28EMjmSGgbXf6ayxg	5	2012-01-30 00:00:00	Hey this place is a classic down town breakfast joint. They sure dont need a A+ review from me, but what the hell. This Place Is Awesome.I love riding my bike to this funky little diner. I always get the breakfast special; this time it was scrambled eggs, ham, fresh jalapenos, and pepper jack cheese, with a side of home frys. Holy Sh** it was good! Everything is super fresh, affordable, and clean. The portions are big, so be mindful of spiting with a friend if so inclined. Also I would recommend getting your delicious food to go and sit in the park just to the south. The wait to sit inside can be very long.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	F7oFLgP6Rlz2xqJuNE1alw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The coffee was delicious, as was the daily lemonade.  We ordered an egg special with country sausage patties, homefries, and toast.  My husband is a huge sausage fan, and he thought it was very good.  The bacon was delish, and the pancakes were simply but fluffy and flavorful.  We will be back, but we will go early because by the time we left, there was a very lengthy wait.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Iw-FNstP5xfbKT0jiJ2wCg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

npIiRNKNU8vjqVwy4m5h-w	3	2011-07-23 00:00:00	We got to Matt's on a Sunday afternoon and only waited about 15 minutes! Hooray, what a good start to what I hoped would be the best breakfast/brunch experience I've had in my 7 years in Phx! The service was outstanding, too!\n\n My fiancé got the Salami Scramble and I got the Chick and Chop. Maybe it's because I grew up in the south where food like this is pretty standard, but I really didn't taste anything special about the breakfast, even though I really wanted to have the "foodgasm" that so many others here claim. The hashbrowns were good, but very, very greasy, and my porkchop was overcooked and very dried out, and was completely overpowered by Rosemary, which I typically love. \n\nMy highest compliments go to the honey lemonade, the berry preserves we were given for the thick sourdough bread, and, of course, the waitstaff! Overall, I think the place is overhyped, much like Pizzeria Bianco, but worth a shot for the experience.  I personally would have felt robbed had I waited more than 15 minutes and gotten food that just made me go "eh."	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	YVEF0hfps0TCml6-K_PZwA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I said, "I don't know, where are you taking me?"  Realized we were in area of Matt's Big Breakfast, looked it up on Yelp for address and decided to try it.  Special today was Eggs Benedict with choice of hash browns or home fries.  I normally don't like poached eggs but thought I'd give it a try.  Glad I did.  The hollandaise sauce was delicious, the canadian bacon was very flavorful, nice sized english muffin and I choose hash browns which were soft and moist but a little too dark.  friend got the 3 egg salami sopprosata omelete (sure spelled wrong) with hash browns and oj.  the homemade, organic strawberry preserves they serves with his toast was amazing.  not too tart, not too sweet, just wonderful.  \n\nwill go back again, however, probably not during the snowbird season.  we were able to get right in this morning and we did hear some regulars talk about how it was nice to see so many people in there today, considering it's now off season for visitors.  apparently, as others have indicated, there can be very long waits to get in.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ewgBCrgzFxDPM8sUvHJ1Wg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The wait in weekends makes it a bit hard to justify at times, and the crowd feels different - folks in their groups who aren't as willing to socialize with others. The weekday crowd feels like more of a community - more solo diners willing to chat. \n\nFood is solid all around - I've had almost everything on the menu and thus stick to the specials most days. You can't go wrong if you're looking for a hearty, well-prepared breakfast.	2	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	OCjgTMSDcI0xmIsrf8KHww	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

O00um48Z358CDwsr6aprWQ	5	2009-04-29 00:00:00	It appears as if my first review of this fine establishment was pushing the envelope a bit, so allow me to reintroduce my opinion of one of my favorite places to dine in this city. \n\nMatt Pool and his breakfast restaurant have received national critical acclaim for their use of local, fresh, organic ingredients and their simple traditional preparation of American breakfast classics. \n\nThe number one complaint I encounter about this restaurant is the wait. Of course there's a wait, it's probably the most famous breakfast joint in this state, and there's a reason people flock to it 6 days a week: because its really good food served by a really good staff. I'm sure that the people who complain about the wait here are the same people who complain about the wait at Pizzeria Bianco. \n\nTo all of those people, I pose this question to you: since when has dining out in America become this rush to get in, stuff your gullet and get out as fast as possible? Why is dining in this country no longer about the experience and the socialization you get with your fellow diners? Why not come downtown, sign up for a table, and then stroll down to Fair Trade for a latte while you wait, or take a nice walk around and see what the Roosevelt district has to offer? We're always in such a hurry...I say it's nice to slow down, spend some time with our friends and family and nosh on a breakfast that is totally worth the wait. I believe that many restaurants have spoiled the average American consumer with instant gratification--how many times have you refused to wait at a restaurant because the wait was 30+ minutes? We want good food, and we want it now, screw everyone else, and if you can't feed our bellies within 30 minutes, we'll take our business somewhere else. This attitude is crap. \n\nYou have to slow down and appreciate how hard this little restaurant works. Matt's wife is there 6 days a week to ensure that their business is performing at the level at which it should. The kitchen staff is there from 6:00 am to almost 4pm sometimes churning out thousands of plates of fried eggs, thick peppered bacon, hash browns, home fries, pancakes, pork chops, burgers...The point is, a lot of love and thought has gone into this restaurant to make sure that every single ingredient put on your plate is of the highest quality possible and is prepared by a very talented kitchen staff. \n\nIt is a small restaurant, but it's always warm and inviting, and the coffee is always hot and fresh and they might not serve you a huge glass of orange juice, but it's always 100% fresh, squeezed that morning by the staff. \n\nAfter my plea to try and understand the other side of this restaurant, I know that I may not have been able to make everyone stop and reconsider any opinions they might have about this place: the wait, the small serving of orange juice, the confined areas, and that's OK. All I'm saying is that this place is an institution in downtown dining...and it's really nice to go an experience the food, the service and the though that goes into running this business if only every once in a blue moon. And if not, that's OK, because there are plenty of people who will gladly take your place in line.	2	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	DETxc-CCwuYFGuAn0c1jEg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I had griddlecakes, bacon and a diet RC and with tip it was $16.  Portions were generous and I was only able to eat one pancake.  Another side note is it's so tiny your wait is outside... Consider the weather.  There is no shade.  I thought it was worth it but I am not sure I'd wait again.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	2Pbc4q74apyOdcQb6Tgj3g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
o60HTosdMwZNx-mNgikESg	5	2011-08-16 00:00:00	There are very few places that I'm completely OK with waiting thirty to forty-five minutes to eat breakfast, much less in the Phoenix heat, but when it comes to Matt's Big Breakfast I don't think twice about it.  It's actually a regular occurrence, while sitting on the outdoor waiting benches, for the guests who are leaving to assure you it is worth the wait.\n\nThe place is small, you might even say cramped depending on where you are sat, but the food is second to none.  I always get the special, which varies from day to day.  It's typically a scrambler with generous helpings of meat and cheese, and some locally grown veggies or peppers.  I recommend a side of home fries with rosemary as opposed to the hash browns.  If you're not in the mood for eggs try the waffle or pancakes (seriously it's just all good), and if bread doesn't come with what you order you've got to try the sourdough toast with house made organic blueberry jelly...so delicious.\n\nIn addition to the amazing food, the service is always great.  Hands down, Matt's Big Breakfast is my favorite breakfast stop.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	MjYqamx898JiRnqYm7kD8Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
OaDmPEFLAUJBGQifOiOkiw	4	2011-04-08 00:00:00	I went to Matt's BB for the first time last weekend.  Took me a moment to get oriented - it's not immediately obvious if you present yourself inside to get on a list or not.  The answer: not.  You sign yourself in.  Once we had that figured out, we waited - but not for as long as I thought.  They certainly have an efficient little operation.  The staff brought out menus for any large parties so the kitchen could start in on their order before they were seated.\n\nOnce inside, we were greeted warmly and had our orders taken promptly.  My wife tried the special - an odd scramble of eggs, spinach and chicken sauage.  She got hers with hashbrowns and some really nice, thick, fibrous toast.  I had a few bites of her toast and was frankly tempted to order some for myself.  I thought the hashbrowns were OK, but I am not crazy about hashbrowns.\n\nI ended up with a bowl of their steel-cut oatmeal, which came with raisins and brown sugar (and milk), then got a side of the homefries.  Sure glad I ordered that side - they were the highlight of the meal.  Perfectly cooked, with nice big chunks of potato, slightly blackened, with fresh rosemary.  Now, I am not always enthusiastic about rosemary.  Can be too strong.  But they'd added the perfect amount.  \n\nI commented to my wife that I could see coming there and having a couple orders of their homefries as my meal - they were that satisfying.  \n\nThe oatmeal was also very tasty.  I wasn't going to bother with it until I saw it was steel-cut.  It was my first time having steel-cut oatmeal at a restaurant, and I enjoyed the contrast to the typical restaurant oatmeal. \n\nSomeone at the next table ordered the pancakes, and they looked fantastic. \n\nService was very attentive and efficient.  We'll definitely be back.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	8whrlF5cxd4OFcjeNrMm0Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Honestly, everything looked appealing. The portions are fair, the prices even fairer, and the food all excellent. My waffle with two slices of bacon was the best waffle and best bacon I've had. Bacon was thick, not too fatty, and perfectly charred. Waffle had texture and crisp. Real maple syrup on the side :) The special chorizo, jalapeno scramble was nice and hot and spicy!

ObtjlZbXt64FhkpyesvKAA	1	2012-07-08 00:00:00	The one star review is because having to wait in the heat totally ruined the whole meal. Seeing there were over 600 yelp reviews, I was expecting to wait. However, if you are successful enough to have a long wait for your restaurant, you should provide something to keep the waiting customers cool. Misters maybe? Maybe expand to have a foyer? \n\nWe waited in the 100+ heat for 40+ minutes. They have a list outside you write your name on so no one is there to tell you how long your wait will be. They provide minimal seating and no misters. There's some ice water with oranges to drink with tiny dixie cups (the kind the dentist provides to swish with). By the time we had our pre-order (where they take your order 10 minutes before they seat you so you don't take up a table too long), I wasn't very hungry and definitely didn't want hot eggs.  After finally getting seated, we immediately have hot plates set down in front of us. \n\nI ordered the BLT (again, I did NOT want eggs when I was so hot!) and it just wasn't that good. Way too much crusty bread that scratched the roof of my mouth. The three people I was with ordered scrambles and said they were nothing they couldn't get elsewhere. The bacon and the waffles were very good. \n\nThe wait staff was very friendly and apologetic but it's not their fault and there's nothing they can say to make up for being terribly uncomfortable.	1	2	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	FOZozF5z2dTlHL451YjxFg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
oDhS6zG3lDqvuw_ormVB7w	4	2009-04-12 00:00:00	This morning's target was Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix. After all of the media hype over this little original were they going to be as good as promised?\n\nWe were thrilled to find that Matt's is very close to the Light Rail stop at Roosevelt and Central, so we took the train and didn't have to worry about finding a parking spot. A very good thing as it turns out as there are a few parking lots near Matt's but all of them were full.\n\nI had heard that's Matt's was small, but I was not prepared for just how small. One car garage small. Including the kitchen! This causes a major problem for hungry customers, the wait was nearly two hours! Wow, this place must be great if people are willing to stand out in the rain for nearly two hours to get in.\n\nOnce we were inside and seated things actually moved pretty quickly. We actually had food inside of ten minutes of ordering. The only con inside I saw really was how loud it was. But hey, I could live with that.\n\nThe food was very good. My wife had the Chop and Chix, a lovely seasoned pork chop, eggs perfectly cooked, home style potatoes and toast. I had a Salami Scramble, three eggs, Molinari sopresseta, hash browns and toast. It was all very good, very flavorful.\n\nHowever, after the hype and the nearly 2 hour wait to get in I was expecting outstanding not just very good. The other reality check item for Matt's was the price. I ordered a soda, $2.75, what I received was a 12oz can of soda. Yup, nearly twice the price of a six-pack of soda at any store in town for one can. A 4oz glass of orange juice, granted freshly squeezed, was also nearly $3.00. Hmmm, I didn't order any. \n\nTotal bill for our breakfast was $27.00 plus tip.\n\nBottom line? Matt's Big Breakfast has very good food, but only very good food. There was nothing exceptional here to justify all of the hype, there are many other breakfast places here in town with food at least as good if not better than Matt's for less money and without the marathon wait to get in.\n\nIf you go to Matt's expect to wait at least an hour, you will enjoy the food I promise. Only you can decide if the wait and the price are worth it.	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	N3bLACFC7VL0T7OBmVDSrA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Not for vegetarians, I guess, because one of my dining companions was not impressed (except, I think she liked the eggs), but I was in hog heaven. Great atmosphere in a city bereft of great atmosphere. Seriously. I asked the hot counter girl what there is to do in Phoenix. She seemed confused by the question. But at least she was hot. Yeah, sorry for even going there, but all the women who worked at Matt's when I was there were really friggin' hot, and I can't honestly say as an honest Yelp reviewer that it didn't count as a factor in the number of times I returned here. But what I can also say is that I wouldn't have gone near the place, hot serving wenches notwithstanding, had the food not been completely, utterly satisfying. Totally worth a drive across the "city" for. Really. I mean. Being from New York, I tend to compliment nobody. I enjoyed Matt's. So congratulations, management. You hired the right people. You cook a mean egg. You know what to do with pork. All of this was appetizing, satisfying, and filling. YUM.	0	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	1aDE-Xns1vqHgQsegbQlcQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

A friend of mine had seen it on Diner's, Dives and Drive In's (or something along those lines) and was excited to try it out. The wait was about 20 minutes(arrived at 9 am) and seating is very limited but worth it!\n\nI'm all about the breakfast food so I was excited to try somewhere new. The menu is limited but covers all bases. The coffee (a special blend just for them) is local as is everything that they serve. I swear the bacon tastes better when it's from around the corner.\n\nI decided on the belgian waffle and a side of hash browns. SUPER YUMMY!! I appreciate the note on the menu that they only use butter and extra virgin olive oil... No trans fats here! The hash browns were a bit oily but tasty overall.\n\nAs I was leaving I saw a huge stack of pancakes on their way to a table... I know what I'm getting next time!!	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	XDuYVWW6xn6e429hjkbF2Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
OjKf_LezBXaEP_S9pOoe4g	5	2010-11-04 00:00:00	I never thought I would say this, but I recently had a breakfast better than one consumed at Matt's.  It's best not to go any further.  That being said, whenever I am off on a weekday, the urge to go to Matt's emerges at the crack of dawn and does not subsist until I have either satiated myself with hash browns at their tiny digs or have painfully decided to deny myself the rich excess.\n\nThe wait is almost always 45 minutes even if you are a party of 1.  Going later helps reduce the wait.  Sometimes.  The wait though only builds the appetite and anticipation.  This is food that deserves such dedication.\n\nI almost exclusively get the special.  And they are all special.  However, the most special of all specials was my first and one that I hope will make a comeback soon.  Imagine for yourself: Chicken Artichoke Sausage, Fresh Mozzarella, Organic Spinach (locally grown, mind you), Hash Browns, and Whole Wheat Toast (with some local fruit preserves that they like to give a lot of props to when they deliver it to you).\n\nAlso, cheers to the wait staff who work frantically in such a small space.  I also appreciate their sort of Mother Hubbard, pseduo-indie, partially jeans and a t-shirt dress code.	1	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	5Z-3tcM07Pyc4mOF2Rjt6Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

This is a tiny converted house and boy is it small. The inside is cute though and there are tables packed in along with a counter top bar.\n\nThe wait is long, and it is also worth it. The best days to go of course are the weekdays. Just avoid the weekend period. Local eggs, cheeses and milk. Local goods in general. The coffee was to die for! Home made jam! Thick cut delicious BACON! Do stop here.	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	We3OtSP2uyHf_uBOl2ixOg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The waffles were soggy and the hash browns were very greasy (both times).  I could have done that at home without the 45 minute wait.  Plus, the coffee is putrid.	7	1	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	fTME7hXl60V5VMQOdW_6xw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Even the water with lemon they have outside for you while you wait is delicious and satisfying. I always go for the special, and my oh my it has never disappointed.\nYou can tell the difference between this place and other breakfast joint once you taste their food, its natural, organic, with lots of flavor and it smells fresh. \nTheir rosemary garlic potatoes are the best, their pancakes are a trip to Neverland, and their coffee is just as good as the one at a Starbucks. \nThis place has a special place in my heart because I remember going to it when the hype hadnt started and I hardly to wait to eat there at first, so I am glad for them because they really deserve all of the attention that they get for their delicious food. Plus, the owners wife always remembers me and even tells me she hasnt seen me in a long time when I go, its just a wonderful place that knows how to treat its customers and how to keep em happy.	1	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ubTxUri-3oU_WjXFY61uYw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

oVEP5BCISHaU0JsFbiXVzQ	5	2012-07-04 00:00:00	Matt's Big Breakfast should be at the top of anyone's Phoenix "Must" list. All of the food is locally sourced and served up so fresh you really can taste it. Everything from their kick ass bacon to their bread to their coffee and juice will knock your socks off with their freshness. It is no surprise that even on a summer's day people sit outside in the heat and wait for a table.\n\nI'm surprised by comments about the service here because all of the girls came out to check on those of us waiting outside and even took our orders in advance so they would be prepared the moment we were seated. Everyone working there was very sweet.\n\nMy last visit was a sad one however because I was suffering from a brief but very severe hangover (what I like to call an Express Hangover) that was so bad all I could manage was a few sips of juice and coffee. If Matt's is in the future I have to make it a point to behave myself the night before because passing up such a great breakfast is a crime in this Yelper's book!	2	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	aKhv49qQ1A1MDvGZ-cVh7Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The eggs tasted SO fresh. THE BEST PART - the HASH BROWNS. Oh my gosh, I have never tasted hash browns like that before - they were perfect! Crunchy on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside - yum yum. The toast was made fresh (like my mom's), and was THE best toast I have ever had at a restaurant. Fresh squeezed OJ was dynamite! SO GOOD! Best OJ I have ever had. Even the coffee was good!! Great vibe - really small place so no wonder there is a wait. PLUS, I saw the workers give a little to-go box to one of the homeless guys on the street - LOVE THAT!!

OYefn3Xq-k_VtU5AMnR_Dw	4	2012-09-30 00:00:00	Big. Big might be a bit of an understatement when describing this place. The portions are HUGE. I ordered the 3 egg omelette with salami, which also came with hash browns and toast. The 3 eggs was more like 4. Half the plate was eggs/salami, the other half was hash browns. Then she brought the toast out, with a homemade jam. Then I had the nerve to order a side of bacon. \n*sidenote* the bacon was 3 thick strips sprinkled in pepper. When I bit into that first piece, the amalgamation of pepper, maple and succulent pig meat did a slow sensual tango with my tongue. I immediately looked around to see if anyone else was having this same experience. Yes. I was not the only one. Bacon. Get it. *end sidenote*\nThere was so much food I had to map out a quick strategy. Started with the bacon. (BACON. GET IT) then dove into the eggs which was very good. The hash browns were on point, and the jam was very good. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give me a 5 is because of the wait. This is a popular spot, so be prepared to wait about 45 min. The place isn't that big, so we waited out front for just about 45. The wait was def worth it.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	-de8fWXYXr5mMAvAQU1-Sw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

P0A2UBClx7JlRinL4_iKAQ	4	2009-03-22 00:00:00	Went here this morning. As usual, the wait was crowded out to the corner of 1st Street. People are willing to wait for good food, I suppose. \n\nOnce you get inside Matt's Big Breakfast (it was about an hour wait for us on a Saturday morning), you see why it took so long. There's about 15 seats in the whole place and it's tiny...like a Manhattan hotel room. People are bumping into each other, sliding around and the commotion is high. It's loud, it's gritty and it's the perfect diner setting.\n\nFor all the press it's gotten, the food better be damn good. And it is. The eggs are cage raised and organic, the pork is from high-quality Iowa farms and most of the produce is local. The fresh-squeezed OJ is legit. And the coffee is from a premium roaster in Cave Creek, AZ. The hash browns are very much like you would find at a joint in the Midwest: buttery on the inside and crispy brown on the outside. \n\nDo yourself a favor and brave the wait and the commotion... it's worth it.	3	2	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	7yi6Mrk1sCU2REZegMf9zw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

As usual there was a wait, but there was some seating outside for us. I have to say I really liked the desert landscaping out front. I ordered the special which was an omelet with fresh jalapenos, cheese, with hash browns. I also ordered a side of the bacon which was delicious! Actually it was all delicious. All of the servers were extremely friendly and said goodbye and thank you to every patron that was leaving. The orange juice is also a must to try. It was like they picked an orange right off a tree.

I had the breakfast special. I have to say that the eggs tasted a bit different to me, but maybe it's because I've rarely had REAL eggs before, lol. I'm used to the thin shelled, mass produced, break up a bunch & keep them in a container till someone orders something with eggs in it kind of taste. They don't even crack them open until they are making your order. Cage free eggs from happy well fed chickens is the way to go :)\n\nThe only con I have to point out is the waiting line if you don't get yourself down there early enough. Especially in this heat! My friend decided that we should, but if her makeup started melting off we'd have to find somewhere else for breakfast, lol. Fortunately, we were called in just on time!	11	8	9	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	KQMzfaaI9jfo68S4CsCifA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
PePWeMkxv8xR1mEgJ9oALQ	4	2009-05-16 00:00:00	Rather than making this another dissertation on every detail of my restaurant experience, I'll try for once to keep it short and sweet. I came here on a Tuesday morning with my friend and my toddler, after a short wait we were seated. We both ordered the bacon and eggs with hash browns. Mine scrambled, hers sunny side up and I also got a pancake on the side for the toddler and me to share (so he wouldn't steal all of my scrambled eggs). The food came pretty quickly and everything was good. My friend said the hash browns were better seasoned last time she was there (they needed a little salt). They were actually made from honest to god, real potatoes, and when was the last time you saw that? I saw in the reviews that they have the best scrambled eggs but I wouldn't go that far. They were good. They also needed a sprinkling of salt and pepper but they were not the best. You have to go to Essence for that. The bacon was nice and thick and delicious and the raisin bread that came with my breakfast delighted my toddler. My pancake was OK. It tasted like a typical good restaurant buttermilk pancake. It did come with warm syrup though and that always makes me happy. Would I come here again? Sure! Would I wait in line on a Saturday for an hour and half? Are you f-ing kidding me?	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	lKPUyA6DveoWk-3zFrHA9w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
PgArmRPE5bFKV_fxASNIQg	5	2011-01-24 00:00:00	I have been here probably five times, but not for awhile.  The only reason for that is that, by the time I'm ready to get breakfast, I'm pretty hungry and can't stand waiting 30 minutes to an hour to get in.  Last Sunday, I actually packed a snack and sat on the curb to face 45 long, hard minutes of being tantalized by delicious smelling food.\n\nI had forgotten just how great this place is.  The service is super friendly and very efficient.  Once you get in, you get served very quickly.  I could swear that they laid down our enormous spread of food within 5 minutes of us ordering, and it's not old, sitting-around-under-a-heat-lamp stuff, it's hot and fresh.  I got some eggs (fresh and cooked to perfection), and wheat toast which was thick cut and had some delicious local strawberry preserves with it, but the standout is always the hashbrowns.  They are the stuff of dreams: a giant, salty, crisp on the outside/soft on the inside, just greasy enough slab of heaven.  Sweet Pea got his usual Hog n Chick that comes with the thickest, most peppery bacon I've ever seen.  And THEN we split a waffle, also delicious (not as outstanding as the rest, but I'm not usually a waffle person.)\n\nIf you want the real deal, a straight-up BREAKFAST - no frills and newfangled foods, but just really quality delicious stuff, then pack a snack and get to Matt's. Nobody does it better.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	0SbZc-oRoMiVtrZjxcIDUg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Its possible that there was another element on the sandwich, but I was in taste heaven and didn't stop to consider what the sandwich was made of.... My home fries were thick cut potatoes with lots of grilled onions and large pieces of rosemary. The large pieces allowed for the flavor to permeate, and I was able to pick around them so that it didn't feel that I was chewing on little sticks. \n\nThe honey lemonade was so great that I ordered a second glass to-go! \n\nMatt's is small and seats only 25 diners at a time, but it is definitely a flavor powerhouse! \n\nFrom now on, I will encourage anyone I know traveling to Phoenix to stop by Matt's. It was fantastic.	4	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	mJWhCoWXpoxgAHXWd0c-3w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

PpFfK10Kfvc-s_cEOlRR2Q	4	2012-09-03 00:00:00	http://stevelerer.com\n\nI traveled to Phoenix only a few days away from the LA marathon in March and was determined to start carbo loading early. My first stop was Matt's Big Breakfast, a place I had patroned back in 2010. That time I ordered the item that Guy tried on triple D and it was really good. He ordered the chop and the chick which was a pork chop and two fried eggs. It was delicious, with a great pesto topping, I only wished I could have had more pesto but they may have given it to me if I had asked.\n\nThe restaurant is small usually with a 10 minute wait even for one person. I didn't mind and hung out with the locals for a little bit before I was able to sit at the bar. The decor and ambiance is not much different than most other small breakfast spots but it is clean and welcoming. The staff was nice and took my order quickly and it was only a short while before my order of the hog and the chick was in front of me. Placed at my spot of the counter was beautifully cooked think cut peppered bacon, crispy hashbrowns, and two perfectly cooked over medium eggs. Everything on the plate was cooked really well and was a perfect breakfast. The eggs were right under medium which is where I like them and the hashbrowns were crunchy and crispy on the outside while still creamy on the inside. Somewhat like a potato latke, just without all the onion. By far the star on the plate was the think cut bacon. Sometimes when a restaurant says that the bacon is think cut it really isn't and other times it is so thick that it comes out uncooked. Matt's got it just right and peppered right to the edge of too much. Just where I like it. I could have eaten platefuls of this stuff, if only they were in LA at the end of the marathon.\n\nThe last thing in my order was the real reason I returned to Matt's. Each breakfast arrives with a side of bread of which you have a few options. Bread aside, the start was the strawberry jam they served on the side. The jam is without a doubt the best thing in the restaurant. It is super sweet with chunks of fruit inside. It has so much flavor in such a simple concoction, I could eat a jar of it. Too bad they only give you about two ounces. I wonder if they bottle and sell it because I would buy.\n\nAll in all Matt's Big Breakfast is a really solid breakfast joint in downtown Phoenix. No wonder it always has a wait. The peppered bacon was delicious and the rest of the meal was nothing to scoff at but, in the end, I would come here every time I visit Phoenix just for the strawberry jam. Check out Matt's Big Breakfast the next time you are in town and let me know what you think.\n\nOverall Review: 7/10	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	0poYV3uCsnYjxQBjUI9XoQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Ate the daily special omelette (3 eggs, turkey sausage, peppers) with tortilla and hash browns. Very good. Will definitely return next time I'm in town.	0	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Pio1zbnpMEW7siJlGqcalg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
pQiTK1zk6LqtGWZcrIPRkg	2	2009-10-03 00:00:00	In the movie "The 40-Year Old Virgin," there is a line they repeat often to Steve Carrell: "You're putting the pu$$y on a pedestal, that's your problem!"\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast was on a pedestal. We'd tried to go there a couple years ago, but the crowd outside was always too threatening a wait. Then, in August, we tried to go, but when we asked "What's the probable wait time?" We were told, "Oh we don't really provide anyone with wait times." The line outside was pretty long, and there wasn't really any shade, and with no potential end to the wait, we came to terms with the possibility that we'd turn into bacon ourselves sitting outside waiting for a table. \n\nThen this morning I woke up at 6:30am on a Saturday due to insomnia and we said "Hey there might actually not be a line if we go right now."\n\nI just came back from breakfast at Matt's Big Breakfast and now I'm waiting for my heart attack.\n\nI'd tried to find out what the big deal was about this greasy spoon so many times in reviews, and nobody ever gave a good explanation in detail of what makes the "traditional breakfast food" so "different."\n\nI ordered the special - which was an egg, cheese, onion and sausage omelette, with hash browns. Since it was our first time there, we also ordered a belgian waffle to split.\n\nThe omelette was more like "Onion and Sausage with a side of egg and cheese." The sausage was giant sliced links, enough to feed an army. The amount of onion was not what I expected - it was probably two entire onions sliced up and thrown in there. The hash browns are a serving for 4 people or something. They're not sliced like ordinary hash browns are sliced - they're ultra skinny slices like angelhair pasta. There are a lot of really crunchy crispy areas of angelhair sliced hash browns which are tasty. Thankfully, they are not all salty. But what sort of human can ingest this much potato in one sitting?\n\nI'm one year away from having been a vegetarian for 5 years, and I was willing to "go there" at this meal because I had to see what everyone was raving about, and I read on the menu that the meat is natural and grain-fed. Not free-range, grass-fed, but at least not corn-fed and hormonalized and antibiotic-ridden. Also, I eat burgers at Delux and Rokerij and I'll eat the prosciutto at Bomberos. So I thought, why not see what the fuss is all about?\n\nIt was a'ight. Not FABULOUS. I tried to figure out why this place is SUCH a big deal to so many. Maybe it is shocking to some people's palates to taste food made with real butter and real cream - people who ordinarily cook at home and fill their cupboards with the healthy substitutes of every ingredient. Or maybe typical people buy Kraft cheese or something, I don't know. The ingredients were definitely "real," which is, I suppose, a big deal if you ordinarily eat Crap for breakfast or eat at Denny's. It most definitely beats "Moons Over My Hammy" for instance.\n\nBut we really missed Pallate, which really WAS the best breakfast downtown.\n\nThe bread they brought for the toast was delicious ... but it's BREAD. Most bread is pretty good. The waffle was uber fluffy. I had a few bites and said "That's a tasty plate of diabetes right there," while I felt my blood sugar go through the roof.\n\nMostly, I really felt a lack in the vegetables department. \n\nI might seem like a health nut, because of this, but trust me, I'm not. I'm a tall, big person and I eat breakfasts at Dick's Hideaway several times a week. It's just that at Dick's Hideaway I can have them substitute the potatoes for veggies (usually asparagus and broccoli), and substitute the meat in the breakfast burrito with avocado. I'm used to having an entire day's worth of greens at breakfast. I suppose meat, for me, is like dessert: I'll eat it but it has to be high quality, and it has to be really worth it. It has to be tremendously delicious, I won't eat meat for meat's sake. This was probably somewhat ethical meat, but it wasn't an irresistible herby or spicy delicious sensation.\n\nThe "thick-cut bacon" that came with the waffle was definitely thick, and was lined with pepper. It was good, but it was also bacon ... bacon SHOULD be good, it's hard to do bad.\n\nI see the trendy hipster appeal everywhere - orange countertops, orange everywhere, down to the stapler on the counter, the 1950's signs that say "Eggs!" and stuff. Whatever. I get it, it's better than Denny's, and it's better than 5 & Diner. It's NOT "The Best" and it's most definitely not worth standing around outside in no shade, without any idea how long the wait will be for a table, like a sucker.\n\nThe chalkboard on the wall inside says "Visit our bar The Roosevelt around the corner." I hadn't known they own the Roosevelt. I recommend going to the Roosevelt and waiting around for a seat there, where it's worth the wait.\n\nI'm glad I finally went, to knock the place off its pedestal. Now I just need to wait like a month or something for my arteries to un-clog.	8	4	5	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	NcvTdn5YGE4CZoESrgZGSw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
PqXFZuxgk0h63GTUxrBXkA	4	2010-01-10 00:00:00	I am a fan of Guy Fieri and this makes the second restaurant from DDD I have visited. I will be honest and tell you that he co-owns two restaurants in California, one of them being a place called Johnny Garlic's. The food was VERY VERY mediocre so I started to wonder if I should trust his taste in food, but then I said ok he goes to these places because people write to him and tell him they are amazing, not because he has any participation in the restaurant itself. So my mom and I went yesterday (Saturday) morning for breakfast. \n\nWe got there around 9 I think and we had to wait about an hour before we were able to be seated. \n\nWe looked at the menu and were like what the heck this is just basic breakfast food, did we just make a huge mistake? Boy were we wrong. The OJ was great. The coffee on the other hand, eh. I've had a lot better. \n\nI ordered the omelet with provolone and mushrooms and onions and home fries and sourdough bread. \n\nMy mom ordered the eggs with hashbrowns and slice of ham. \n\nThe omelet was huge and gooey with cheese. The mushrooms and onions were cooked to perfection. The home fries were only ok, and that might be because they were a tad cold. The bread is obviously homemade and the jam that came out with it was incredible. \n\nMy moms ham was great. We were not expecting such a big slice and such a thick slice. The taste was amazing as well. \n\nAfter breakfast we walked across the street and went to the farmers market. \n\nI am visiting from California, and should I ever find myself in Phoenix ever again, I will definitely come back and maybe next time try the bacon egg and cheese sandwich. \n\nThe only thing keeping this place from 5 stars is the coffee and the limited menu options.	6	3	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	zy4NqQpPWNRftutQEhVb1g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
Pt4pewz8agHkTWtocngmEQ	5	2011-08-22 00:00:00	There are 480 reviews of Matt's Big Breakfast at this time. My guess is that I can't say anything that hasn't been said here or on Food Network. I have wanted to get here for a while, but finally made it in last week with "second wife". She and I are always up for sharing, so we got the cheese omelet with wheat bread and the griddlecakes. Wow.\n\nThe omelet was large and tasty; it went very well with the Tapatio that we both tried (for the first time!). We got the rosemary potatoes on the side and they were delish. The griddlecakes were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, just perfect. Light and airy with a touch of sweetness.\n\nSaving the best for last... the toast. The bread was dark and amazing- full of seeds and whole grains. It came with a little butter, even though we asked for it dry. There was a small side of house-made blueberry preserves that were incredible. I would go back just for the toast and preserves!\n\nWe went on Friday at 1pm, probably a smart move.	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	2TAvvTz9E6AOYObB9OOjaw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
pTsBbXoUt8Ik3WzTzUdV5Q	5	2008-12-16 00:00:00	Simply the best place in Arizona for breakfast!\n\nMatt's does absolutely everything right.  No freezers in the back, fresh produce from the market, and quality ingredients all the way around shows just how amazing independent restaurants can be.\n\nThe obvious bad about Matt's is the wait.  There are few breakfast places that don't have a wait on Saturday or Sunday morning and Matt's is no exception.  The problem is, however, due to the limited capacity, the wait can become excessive.  I've never waited more than 90 minutes (that was with a group of 5) but when you are hungry, 20 minutes can seem like an hour.  \n\nIf you can occupy yourself with a Kontakt or the Farmers Market long enough to stick around, the rewards are great.  Wonderful, quaint diner setting filled with bright white and orange walls and counters.  An intimate setting where you can be sure you will interact with at least someone else during your meal.  \n\nThe food is great and I have yet to be disappointed.  I usually just order the Special, whatever it may be.  It makes it easier than trying to decide.  The Five Spot is another favorite of mine - egg and cheese breakfast sandwich that is top quality.  The wife always orders the hog and chick (meat and eggs).  The best part of every breakfast is the hashedbrowns that are cooked in butter and better than you've ever had them.\n\nThe workers are sweet and full of personality.  Matt sometimes stops in to drop off milk or eggs or to say Hi to his wife.  She is usually running around making sure everything goes smoothly.  \n\nDo not let the wait deter you.  Go to Matt's.  Take every one of your visiting relatives and friends to Matt's.  Make a special trip from the far east or west valley to go to Matt's.  Just don't do it the day that I go.	2	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	-RhRXVW9z9fs5zzxhFfnHg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
pVKFS2MorNZx8mKNrvxUjQ	3	2010-01-16 00:00:00	I wish I could give 31/2 stars...\n\nFirst of all...just check this place out and decide for yourself- that is if  you don't die of heat stroke while waiting in the 110 degree summer sweatfest that is most notably Phoenix. Or better yet just thank Matt once you make it inside for not bothering to accommodate patrons with some type of effing shading device!!!!! PLANT SOME TREES!!!! UMBRELLAS!!!! OVER HANG! PATIO! A GUY U PAY $3.35/hr WITH A HUGE PIECE OF CARDBOARD! ANYTHING! ok..you get the point. \n(I understand this setup in any other state people, but seriously....!) and btdubs..the outside is just fugly...trees plz!\n\nblah blah blah... once you make it inside everything is great! Simple, basic food, friendly service, quaint atmosphere, decent prices. Yeah you could make it at home, but you can make any breakfast food at home, that is the point of "going out" for breakfast.\n\n*TIP! call ahead and order and then eat while you walk to your car! superkewl time saver DOH!	2	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	7yoVn6xAPu8iEeXT5H3j1g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
pVKzeGYOCTgsz6vCdfYzlw	2	2012-09-16 00:00:00	This place came highly recommended.  Perhaps my expectations were too high.\n\nThey have a boring, uninspired menu. Nothing special. The food itself was fine.  It was fresh, and they apparently use all-natural organics.  We had the special Denver scramble. The home fries are chunks of pan-fried potato. Lots of rosemary.  But the flavors just weren't very exciting or bold.\n\nThe strawberry preserves were very good, as was thick cut toast.  Yes, the toast is worth mentioning.  Cut thick, toasted to perfection.  And the bread itself is a really good bread.\n\nI doubt I will return.  If I'm going to go out for breakfast I would choose someplace that features bolder flavors, like The Farmhouse in Gilbert.\n\nMy wife liked it better than I did.  It's really not bad, but if I'm going to go out and pay for a meal I prefer something less pedestrian.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	YJYFsF4z-C2qODH5HnGXiw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

PxwZmN5BNHOTy4h73geESQ	1	2010-10-02 00:00:00	After all the hype this was an overpriced disappointment. I orderd the griddlecakes with milk and coffee to drink. I also ordered a side of bacon as several reviewers recommended it. Including tax but not tip my total for breakfast was $16.01.  \n\nThe pancakes tasted like Bisquik and the bacon was crispy black and looked and tasted like the cheap grocery store bacon you buy in the shrink-wrap packages. Even funnier the "three pieces" were actuallly only 1/2 pieces of bacon at around 4" long. Overall I've had much better breakfasts at The Good Egg and First Watch at a lower price. \n\nAnother disappointment was waiting for me in the parking lot. An employee had parked her white Volvo behind my car and blocked me in. I first waited for her to finish unloading the car, assuming she would move the car after she was done. Instead she came out once more, closed the the trunk and went back inside. I had to go back inside and ask her to move.  The employee did finally move her car but she didn't bother to apologize.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	oljNOXt0KnejLICACwnzdg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
Q3R9wWkq6TWOLfufpEhStw	5	2008-07-05 00:00:00	Matt's Big Breakfast is a wonderful place in the morning to feel the life of downtown Phoenix.  I have eaten there 5 times in the last year and each meal was worth the 10 to 20 minute wait out side on the sidewalk.  \n\nAt 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday, July 3, my wife Marie and I ventured downtown and decided to have breakfast out.  Matt's was on our mind.  We waited outside only 5 minutes before getting a table by the window next to the kitchen entry.  Busy place, but the service was great.  Quick with the coffee for Marie and ice tea for me.  Marie ordered an omelet with cheese and mushrooms, while I decided on the special, eggs benedict.  We both had the home fries. \n\nWhen everything arrived, the meal was very yummy.  Marie, in her delicate way, snarfed down her omelet with a smile.  My eggs benedict was on a fresh English muffin, topped with ham, poached eggs, and a yummy hollandaise sauce.  Calories be damned!\n\nThe whole meal cost $22.53 + 4.00 tip.\n\nYes the place is small and you'll most likely have a short wait for a table, but get over that, because the experience of eating good food prepared by great people is worth your time.	3	0	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	A6qsbNic6ikqgKV-t1bxRg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I am finding Guy F. loves Arizona... after spending a week here I can see why.. tons of good eats super little time! Got here after the business people but before the slacker crowd (back home that means somewhere between 8:30 and 9 AM). So we had no wait....\n\nI got the five spot which totally kept me full for hours...that and the three cups of local coffee... The peppery bacon this joint uses is to die for...My five spot: The sweet onions, the bun, the bacon and the perfectly cooked eggs.... solid breakfast. I had a taste of Julie K's griddlecakes and they were yummy. \n\nI appreciate simplicity and this place has some basics on the menu but do them well. Reasonably priced menu... I highly recommend :-).\n\nFew things\n1. BRING QUARTERS ....  lots of places to park but it is metered parking\n2. come early and make sure EVERYONE in your party is there\n3.

The wait makes it all the better. And that strawberry lemonade?! Whoo, tasty. Just lighten up on the ice!

Nah just kidding about the memory but totally serious about the food coma.  We checked this place out on an off day and it was still pretty populated.  Breakfast anytime CAN NOT BEAT THAT!!!  My bro and I got the the same platter which was the special of the day.  Linguisa with sourdough toast, hash browns, home fries, eggs, homemade preserves!!!  Everything was SPECTACULAR!  Like seriously!!!  It was a very homey and neighborhood feel to the restaurant with super excellent service.  Ninja water and coffee refills, great timing and check ups!  I think that it was part of our server as well but she was magnificent as well.

(when going downtown, carpool, people!) we were promptly seated, and just in time, as a bunch of people came in 5 minutes later, and had to wait outside. \n\ni had the daily special of chorizo with eggs and jalapenos, my bf had the sausage and eggs combo (forgot its actual name). i personally don't really care for rosemary, but if you like it, the potatoes will rock your socks off. we were both stuffffffed. the food was incredibly hot, fresh and delish (and spicy!). service was fast... so we were happy. until we thought about how much butter we were consuming. but bc it was so yummy, that we decided we didn't care. \n\n the homemade toast and preserves were also pretty killer. even though i was stuffed to the brim, i ended up eating my bf's last piece of toast and preserves as we walked out. they were that good.\n\ni just wish there were more menu options...	2	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	zSwb7qNpSgU3ekHMpiHsOA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Ordered Hog (sausage patties) and Chick, but really didn't want hashbrowns. No subs tough, so got a single pancake side. Sadly, I must say it was only an average breakfast. Eggs OM as requested, and sausage good, but almost too spicy, overpowering the pork. The hashbrowns are a waste though, like an afterthought to fill the plate. Almost burned, raw in the middle. Easy enough issue to fix though. Matt should bump up the quality control to keep the place hoppin'. No big worries though, I'll be comin' back!	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ZBzk54ElTdGh-C4reDnqcg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The third time my name was scratched off. In this hour of waiting I hadn't even been acknowledged. I love small places like this and don't mind waiting, but I would rather drive to Tucson and wait for a table at Franks or BoBos than go back and try this place again. No food is good enough for an hour+ wait and to be forgotten. Again, don't bother.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	4C0XJB8A96FWEuXrJRQ5bQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
Qm4K7RGY-Q5Yah8QtVlHag	3	2011-02-12 00:00:00	We heard about this from a friend and when I did a google search to find it I came across a video clip from "Diners, Drive-ins and Dives" on Youtube. They made it look yummy so I took my hubby there one weekday morning last week. The parking lot was full and there were about 6 people waiting outside. Take a timetravel trip back to the 40's or 50's...there is an old motel and attached to it is this little, TINY diner. You walk up to the door and add your own name and # in party to the paper on the cart by the front door. Find a seat on a bench, if you can. Oh, if you have to park on the street because the lot is full bring some quarters because the spaces are metered.\n\nWe waited about 15-20 minutes. When you go in there is a counter and tables for two around the outside wall. There is at least 1 table for 4 in the back.\n\nI wanted to go here because they claim that they use all fresh ingredients "No freezer or microwave" and they use organic when possible. I saw the eggs being delivered and they were regular, not organic. When we were seated the waitress was right there to take our order. Since it was the first time we had been there we were a little slow, felt pressured because they want to turn the tables in this 7 top restaurant.\n\nMy hubby and I both ordered the "local, organic apple cider" at $3.95 per glass. It was an 8 oz glass so I felt that was steep! He ordered the bacon, eggs, hash browns and toast. The eggs were perfect, the bacon was limp- he asked for extra crisp, but it tasted good. The hash browns were a very large serving and crisp on the outside but very creamy, mushy on the inside, tasted good. The bread was homemade, 2 thick slices of cranberry walnut and he enjoyed it.  I ordered the waffle. It was a waffle, sprinkled with powdered sugar- which I can't stand and served with warm maple syrup. It came with 2 large slices of pepper bacon. It was all good, but with all the hype I was expecting more. \n\nI saw a woman at the counter eating what I thought was eggs benedict so I asked the waitress. She said it was but that they had just run out! Boo hoo! I would have really enjoyed that! She said it is their special every Thursday and to come back. Now, I checked the website before we went and did not see this special or any others. If it is a weekly special I don't understand why it isn't on the website so people know. \n\nI had to visit the ladies room. Now I have been to some out of the way places but this was really odd! You have to go out of the restaurant, into the hotel next door, wander down the hall...you can hear a tv, there is a no vacancy sign. There is a small sign for "Matt's customers", turn right (into a room) the restroom is a unisex bathroom in a hotel room. There is no waste basket for ladies and the hand towel is a real towel on the bar. It was vintage and clean but using the same towel as everyone else is NOT sanitary.\n\nI would go again if I happened to be in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	57Hg2ad5RO6OjIzwT6lPQw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

So if you can't get there at 6:30am when they open, I would recommend going after the lunch crowd dies down, before they close at 2:30p. Look at how empty it gets:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix?userid=QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA#l4u6G9p-5Jzlbw7oS2kCjA\n\nAt that time you can order off the breakfast OR lunch menu, if they haven't sold out of everything by then.	10	6	8	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	QhYJx2jQdPuSq3fGe3aGcA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

We had the eggs benedict, which were quite good and the hashbrowns were extremely crisp. I had the waffles which melted in my mouth. The batter was not salty but sweet. We were really impressed. Matt's has a tiny parking lot next to the building but parking can be a problem.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Jb5VI6q-h0O34EcRRZegwA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Wonderful, friendly, on the ball staff.\n\nMy wishes for this place are:\n \nThey would put an awning and some misters outside for while you are enduring the long wait. The sun was beating down on us and we almost left as we had our 6 year old....it was getting to be a bit much. Easily rectified with some more shade and misters. I'm guessing they don't bother as they get enough business even without them.\n\nAs vegetarians, when we get something without meat, and don't sub it for something else, I always wish the price would be adjusted slightly. Wishful thinking in most places, I know.\n\nOpen something in Laveen Matt. :)	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	zjWXlQHTFfTiCUyqcCCnEA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
qsCMuwBhzDGelZRTxPQ7BA	4	2008-11-26 00:00:00	It's tempting to suggest, "an egg is just an egg". You hear that kind of thing a lot, and admittedly, there have been plenty of "legendary" breakfast places that have made me feel just that. Matt's Big Breakfast is not one of them.\n\nWhat makes MBB unique is the quality of the food and the quality of the ingredients they use to make it. True, there menu is small, and when you read it, nothing particular will jump out at you , but that doesn't mean there's nothing special on it. For instace, everybody serves hashbrowns but these are without a doubt THE BEST hashbrowns I have ever had. The omlettes and eggs are great too. \n\nNo doubt, Matt's serves five-star food. It only loses a star because it's a little pricey and the wait is usually waaay too long. Maybe I shouldn't hold that against them, but I do...so get over it. \n\nAlso, their lunch is just average, and of course, they close far too early.	2	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	sCkAjRH06MLgubOYNCT2Dw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
qswsxM7PbKJEYVYlC5e7NQ	4	2011-01-01 00:00:00	Because of all of the other yelpers describing the long waits, my partner and I decided to try Matt's on a Wednesday, mid morning.  We waited about 10 minutes before being seated.  I enjoyed the unpretentious atmosphere of Matt's Big Breakfast.  The service was excellent.  When I say excellent, I mean our waitress took our drink orders immediately, answered our questions expertly, and brought our meals exactly as ordered (which is impressive because I can be a tad high maintenance).  Our food was pipping hot and very tasty.  I had the cheddar omelette and added mushrooms and onions. I ordered home fries (roasted potatoes with rosemary and onions) and fresh squeezed orange juice.  The orange juice was just the right size, and not too sweet.  The omelette was chock full of mushrooms, onions and cheddar.  The potatoes were golden brown and delicious with a little extra salt.  My partner ordered the griddle cakes which she said were soft, buttery and with the real maple syrup, yummy.  While Matt's is pretty small, I think there's plenty of room to enjoy a great meal!	0	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	eHaId2y7uUSbdh69E-yLtg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
QTOk9GdZa4BrriiKdHUCeg	5	2011-01-03 00:00:00	Its been a while since the hubs and I had been to Matt's. \n\nWe woke up on New Years Eve and I knew Matt's had to be our last breakfast of the year. \n\nWe got there at about 930 and were 5th in line! Wooooot! \n\nThe hubs and I grabbed a spot on one of the benches and had fun watching all the newbs come up. They always walk right past all the people standing outside waiting, past the sign in page and march inside like they own the place. soooo funny. \n\nThe food and service is still as great as its ever been! The waffle was sent from heaven and so was the bacon! \n\nEven though our visits have become few and far between due to moving further away, Ernie still knows who we are and keeps teasing us and asking when we are going to have kids, she is like a distant aunt! Love her! \n\nKeep it up Matts!	2	2	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	BmipmKVTx37gpfPzK7eU4A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
qYIfNfWA3EJ8LKEgcIadmg	4	2009-01-07 00:00:00	The fam and I were hitting some DDD spots last week in Phoenix while we were out there from LA, and we had to hit Matts.\n\nI've actually thought a lot about this place since, and I have to say I dig it.  It has a serious funky factor - it's tiny, loud and the servers are friendly and outgoing.\n\nAs for the food, the pancakes were rock star - absolutely delicious.  If I was on death row getting my last meal, those cakes would send me to the great beyond in peace.\n\nOther foods were good, and I don't get the deal with everyone saying the coffee is crappy - it's better than chain restaurants, so I don't know what the problem is.\n\nThere is one thing that's keeping me from giving it 5 start.  While we were there, about 5 minutes after we ordered, the power went out on the whole block.  To their credit, they finished our order, but the place heated up and filled with smoke from the grill (the fans weren't working), and by the end of the meal we couldn't see the back of the restaurant from the smoke.\n\nThat's fine and all, but someone called Matt and he came down and was stomping back and forth through the restaurant - walking around outside, back in, back outside.  The place was full, and it would have been appropriate for him, as the proprietor to talk to the customers, let us know what's going on - he didn't do anything, and we were all just staring at each other and him.  It was a weird scene - he could have set everyone at ease, and at least poured everyone some free iced tea, but there was nada.\n\nPower failures aside, the place is the bomb, and just what a breakfast place should be.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	b6i0lJga9-e10y1osb2Vww	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

QZI0V4niS3m7y-vX--eo5g	5	2010-04-01 00:00:00	Matt's Big Breakfast is a place that I try to get to multiple times a month.  To put it simply... it is amazing.  I am not a big breakfast person, but I would gladly make time to get over there for some food when I can.  The Eggs Benedict and most of the specials are great!  I typically choose hash browns over home fries, as the hash browns are a little lighter, but both are quite tasty.  Most people overlook the lunch items on the menu, they are just as good as the breakfast items.  The pesto chicken sandwich and the big butter burger are quite delicious.\n\nWhat else to say... The staff is very friendly and attentive. I have never had a bad experience there and it is well worth the wait if you have the time.\n\nOh and do yourself a favor... make sure to get some Bacon (unless you don't eat bacon).	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	lCu30WXGpmTv0oZ4fjDogw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
qztDOnCYwrz7mdJkF0yNHQ	3	2007-10-08 00:00:00	When people say Matt's is small, they're right.  I think there are maybe 8 tables and some stools up at the bar and that's about it.   Also, don't expect to walk right in & grab a seat.  Popular spot + tiny place = waiting (we waited about 45 minutes for a table for 2).  Thankfully, it was a pretty nice day, though there isn't a whole heckuva lot to explore in the area.\n\nPlusses:  \n-They serve RC cola!  Fun times.  I haven't had an RC since I was a kid.\n-Their waffle is really good.   Light, sweet, buttery deliciousness.  \n-Small place = intimate setting.  It's a good place for conversation, at least in a small group setting.\n\nMinuses: \n-The place, and my silverware, weren't especially clean.  Having a knife that's gunky doesn't make me want to eat.\n-The bacon was underdone.  I like chewy bacon, but mine was almost oinking.  I'll take a steak medium-rare, but please not the bacon.\n-The aforementioned RC cola gets served to you in can form. \n\nAll-in-all, the food was pretty good, but not a place I'd wait outside for 45 minutes for.  \n\n3.5 stars.	1	0	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	jzjcDOIaiJOP5mci0FEStg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

rFAeki7-P1PNwCGNSU6Kfw	5	2011-01-10 00:00:00	We were heading towards Scottsdale from Peoria and wanted a great breakfast place.  This breakfast did not disappoint!  We had to wait about 45 min. due to all the Oregon and Auburn fans in town, but well worth the wait anyway.  I had the pancakes and they were the best I have had served up in a restaurant.  My husband had the eggs, hash browns (crispy and buttery), toast with home made strawberry jam (like freezer jam my mom use to make with strawberries from our garden) and thick peppery bacon that you could smell cooking while waiting outside.  Next time I think I might ask for the jam and spread it on the pancakes.  Very limited menu, but like a lot of people say pick a few things and make them very good.  This is exactly what they have done there.  \nYou might even have a chance to meet the owner of the building and the Hotel Coronado next door, he mingles in the crowd and likes to strike up conversations with anyone.\nWe have had many people recommend different restaurants to us and they don't always live up to the hype, however this place was above and beyond what we expected.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	LMiKP_LoHgSbNtRjrU_yYA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
RfxJK69VoZ8nLeLyM5-IEQ	2	2013-01-20 00:00:00	I've been hearing good things about this place for so long, it was ridiculous I hadn't yet been. I'm all about supporting local business & breakfast is my favorite meal, so this past Saturday I decided to check it off my foodie bucket list. I met 2 friends at 10am. One of them had gotten there at 945 and put our name on the list for a table of 3. Almost 1 hour later, we were seated at a 2 top with an additional chair pulled up. To start, a hipster waitress wearing a huge gold watch and too many bracelets asked what we wanted to order after we had been seated for no more than 2 minutes. Menu-  I've been craving French toast all morning. Come to find they don't have French toast. "French toast is seasonal". Really? Waitress is back again asking what we want after an additional 2 minutes. I ordered a waffle that came with 2 pieces of bacon for $7.50. Waffle was good, served with real cream butter. They do have real maple syrup which is a plus. The bacon was thick, but peppered on the sides which I don't like. Maybe I'm greedy but I also think they should have given 3 slices for a $7.50 plate. I also ordered a cup of coffee (which admittedly I am a coffee snob). Ick.  Burned and watered down at the same time. Needing the extra caffeine, I got my coffee refilled once the cup had been empty for almost 15 mins. I actually asked a server passing by twice if they could refill it.  They never did bring the creamer I asked for (also twice) so I couldn't even drink the 2nd cup. All in all, we waited entirely too long for a crowded place whose food was nothing to write home about. Our bill was almost $50 including tip for 3 people. I recommend you skip this hipster spot that has been hyped up entirely too much. Simply doesn't meet up to expectations IMO. If I'm craving a hipster breakfast and am prepared to shell out $50 for 3 people, I will swing by Postino's for brunch on Saturday/Sunday and get a meal with fresher ingredients and much better coffee and service. Likely a shorter wait, too.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	jYJBIyY3IPWvwizu6qyzcw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
Rg7wZf6Au-0iVOqGT1WoXQ	4	2010-09-08 00:00:00	Bright and early, there I was standing in line, waiting to get into Matt's Big Breakfast.  The wait was tolerable, perhaps because it was still early (roughly 8AM).  Although, this tiny restaurant only provides limited number of seating; they were well-managed and promptly operated.  In addition, the waiter was friendly and the service was just flawless.  It didn't just take the restaurant's staff members to provide customers' smooth dining experiences; the customers also knew the etiquette.  They get in, eat, and get out, making the wait bearable.\n\nLike the name of the restaurant, the portions of our breakfast were extremely satisfying.  The extra plus Matt's deserves is the reasonable pricing that is particularly easy on your wallet.  Both their breakfast and lunch menu items range from $4 to $8 - incredibly affordable.\n\nI ordered the five spots with home fries.  As the dish was placed in front of me, the smell of fresh rosemary had swiftly increased my appetite.  The home fries were buttery, perfectly cooked, and well-seasoned.  The eggs weren't as fluffy as I'd like, but overall the pros definitely exceed the cons.\n\nI'd definitely stop by whenever I happen to be in town.  Bottom-line, good food, good service, and affordable prices, who wouldn't be a fan?	2	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	vVYhAa0P2RfpWPQBrlztJg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

RjuSkxQvJR-t67AhS0jnXA	4	2007-06-23 00:00:00	There and back again..\n\nWe ventured this morning to a great land called Phoenix (though today we shall call that Gondor) from our little Scottsdale burrow (we shall call that the Shire). The Shire has many wonderful things to offer so we don't venture to far. \n\nThere's been talk of a movement in the great land of Gondor.. this movement is called Slow Food. Were great humans feed others based on sustainable crops, dairy and meat. These humans try to whenever possible, use only locally grown ingredients. There was word of an outdoor market that believes in these philosophies and shares with all the locals there. So off to Gondor.  \n\nAfter an easy and painless journey we arrived at the great outdoor market to find that it wasn't open yet. A very small distance east of there were a few humans mulling around a classic Gondor building that looked to have been turned into some sort of eatery. Once inside we discovered a great man named Matt and his magical Big Breakfast! We were seated at a counter with many other hungry travelers. \n\nA fair maiden appeared.. she was so friendly and welcoming.. then took our orders.. the great man Matt had created something just for that day.. Salsa Verde Huevos Rancheros. The way the maiden pronounced these words we though for a moment she was speaking Elven.. only moments had passed and then set before us were 2 huge plates filled with roasted potatoes, 2 eggs over easy atop a corn tortilla covered in a green sauce. You see hobbits love good food, you can tell by their round bellies and lack of defined abs.. this was indeed a bountiful feast!  The fragrance arose from the plate and filled our nostrils.. we both stared into each others eyes then quickly began eating.. the flavors and textures were simply heavenly.. each better then the last! \n\nWe could see ourselves making the journey to Gondor quite often from the Shire.. we could see someday perhaps living in Gondor close to the outdoor market and of course the great Matt's Big Breakfast.	4	9	7	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	p_azadim_uWFOXAhhKB3ag	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

You MUSt get the hashbrowns!! everything tastes so fresh and flavorful. Its one of my favorite breakfast joints.

rthXQ9aVr25amCMuvh3M1w	1	2008-06-18 00:00:00	It's about time that people be a lot more honest in their reviews of Matt's Big Breakfast.\nThis place is over hyped in every sense, and mainly - still - because of its faux-trendy/hip atmosphere...  that was cute five or so years back.\nThough, what matters is the food and maybe the surroundings of a place, right?\n\nWell, the servings are hearty (pack an extra artery), and the home fried potatoes are tasty.\n\nThat's about it.\nEnd of review.\n\nNo... got to be a little more honest here.\n\nThe rest of the menu is mediocre at best, and hardly worth an hours' wait in line and/or just to be seated, nor enough to chew on or pay for.  The first or second time might be cool, you may enjoy it.  But the third time there you'll be honest to admit that there's far better elsewhere.\nAs surroundings go, the place is like a muggy gym locker room but smaller in size, and so poorly ventilated that you'll think that the proprietor's must think nothing of sitting in the humidity upon a toilet of a rest stop in Austin, TX with their plate of food on their knees.\nMe thinks that anyone with a few simple squares of aluminum foil and heat could cook any of Matt's menu items within their own kitchen and very likely do better within 20 minutes flat, easy.\n\nI don't mean to sound harsh or scathing, but after hearing so many sheep over hyping this place time after time you realize it's all fake kissy-kiss talk.  "Phooey!", I say.\n\nThe most important thing you must know and take from this - regardless of whether anything I'm saying here is something you agree with or not - is to beware of the... ehm... "coffee".  Sincerely.  I've heard many others state that you must be an incredibly gracious customer to take a sip.  Merely a whiff of its bouquet brings to mind a vinaigrette of acrid rags and dank wool socks.  Most folks count on having a great cup of coffee with their breakfast; a great cup of coffee is obviously required in conjunction with breakfast.  Like the necessary combinations of two things: Sun & Moon, peanut butter & honey, soap & water, doesn't everyone have a knowing that if you're going to serve coffee during breakfast it needs to taste like coffee?  Even if it's the most watered down brew it needs to taste something LIKE coffee.  Apparently Matt's will hear none of that; they don't seem to be aware nor have heard the talk that some folks don't return just because their coffee resembles what Grandpappy brewed up in a drop-pan a week ago ON TOP OF the coffee grounds that he brewed a month ago, then filtered through newspaper taken from the doghouse outside and used a second time to line the bottom of a bird cage.  (Shwew!)  In fact, I can count two separate occasions when I had actually overheard a server apologize to customers who'd commented on their putrid brew.  Utterly disgusting.\n\nThe servers and cooks are nice, friendly and personable (I'm talking - genuinely enjoy what they do) and that, admittedly, counts for a whole lot.\nNonetheless, give Matt's a try at least once.\nAt least.\nBut, pass on the coffee... or, "Don't go into the light!" as they say of near death experiences.	5	8	6	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	vRQzrDWd5w-wOiyh6fjxEQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Despite how busy it gets, the food came promptly and the wait was bearable (though 30-40 minutes on a Sunday morning can be hard for those running short on time!).  It's funny how you can smell bacon/greasy meat before you even walk in!  I eventually got accustomed to it.  I didn't get to try the waffles, but their hash browns were soo good!  I will definitely come back again if I'm in Phoenix again.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	DRH27qFWsNjMF6dMBwOMGg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
RU5qm7Wey6jrr1qJbIOTkA	2	2012-12-05 00:00:00	I am new to the Phoenix area and was in the mood for someone else to cook my breakfast for a change and stumbled across all these rave reviews of Matt's on yelp. Normally I find that the yelp reviews are just about spot on and very honest. This is my first case of the contrary. I don't know what hole in the wall "amazing" breakfast joint these reviews were for, but I must have been at the wrong place.........\n\nDon't get me wrong this place is reasonably priced for your basic breakfast, but that is about it. I gave them an extra star for using "local" ingredients. This place is below Waffle House and the like on my list. \n\nThe hash browns were more like a chopped potato omelet that needed a few more minuets, I.E. raw mashed potato in the middle. They take "over easy" a little too serious also. If there were such a thing as egg tar tar, that's what was on my plate. If you have ever had eggs like this, the ones that can't even be eaten with a fork, then you know my pain. I will say my pork chop was good, but who can screw up a pork chop? The bread was good, nice thick cut slices of what looked to be locally baked loafs. The preserve that came with said toast was okay too, but it got snatched away before I could finish. \n\nAll in all, this place is good for the sheep that need to eat downtown, but lacks anything for a reason to return or recommend it to anyone. If you are in the area and thinking of eating here, try somewhere else. I didn't have to wait in line like many on yelp have stated, and I'm sure glad I didn't for that lack of quality. There are many other options in the area, give someone else a shot that's not banking on you eating there because they were on T.V.................	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	N_L16gWLJP5CQv9tAel1aw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
rwDAHss_bkqKSZP18yXcTw	3	2012-08-06 00:00:00	Googled best breakfast in Phoenix and this place  popped up, saw Guy F's review from April this year and it was good so we gave it a try this morning. It is easy to miss because it is so small. It had awesome service, was very fresh and tasty but disappointed because they only have RC Cola ( no refills) and not a huge menu but overall it was good. The special was awesome with home fries, around $8, my son got the waffle ( only get 1) with 2 bacon for around 8-9$ and my husband got 3 pancakes for about 9$ as well. You only get a small amount of syrup so an extra side is $1.50 ( too pricy for 3 pancakes). Bill was $28.00 and I think too much for what we got. The food was good, had to give it a try. Would never wait for more then a few minutes to eat there.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	l2pHdxDMHfdU34W6vJNjhg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Thick cut bacon, fresh squeezed orange juice, crispy has browns, fresh preserves on sourdough toast.  Oh man, is this place good. Yes, you might have to wait a while to get seated in this TINY place, but it is worth it! \n\nThe service is very friendly and very quick.  I enjoy sitting along the window with their cute little knick knacks.  \n\nI hear the lunch menu is just as good at breakfast, but I have yet to try.  I honestly wish this place was open for dinner..."brinner" is my favorite meal! ;-)	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	5g5BjhARiZ4zw0SthMH0OQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
S10t1G-rrHfixnjKAJBAVg	4	2010-04-26 00:00:00	After driving from Lake Havasu to Phoenix, the bf and I were ravenous and wanted something big and breakfast-y.  Matt's Big Breakfast was the natural choice, and we didn't regret it, not one bit!\n\nWe arrived at 2pm, and the place closes at 2:30, according to the sign on the door.  Luckily, they let us eat.  I got the waffle and eggs ($6).  The waffle was possibly the best I'd ever had - big squares of Belgian waffle fluffiness.  The eggs, scrambled, were organic, and they made sure we knew it.  I appreciated this very much because I live in organic capital of the world.  Also on the side was a delicious, fresh thick-cut of bacon, perfectly peppered.\n\nThe bf had the salami scramble ($6.50), equally delicious, with authentic, not-out-of-the-bag salami.  These were thick chunks, and tasted wonderful in the softly scrambled eggs.\n\nIf I'm ever in this neck of the woods again, I'll be sure to stop by Matt's. Overall, a delicious breakfast experience for a steal!	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	jjuxiwKoiz8voegbWEJVMg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
s3o3QUmKcwHb94V3OjxqYg	4	2012-11-28 00:00:00	Since we were on vacation and Guy Fiere had suggested a breakfast place my wife agreed to go to Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix. This place may have converted my wife to becoming a breakfast liker.\n\nThough there menu below is kinda of lite on options. Nine breakfast items and if your there after 11am you can choose from another nine lunch items. If it wasn't for Guy Fiere featuring them on them twice on the Food Network we would have skipped this place. How could any of these common breakfast items be so good to wait in line for about forty-five minutes.\n\nOverall the restaurant can hold maybe about fifty people. I wouldn't suggest this place if you had a party of more then four. They really don't have room to combine a whole lot of tables. Also they don't quote wait times be scared, be very scared or bring a newspaper or your phone with a 2 person game like we did. We like playing Connect 4 it's an easy game but both of us are pretty competitive, so time passes fast. \n\nWe got seated at the bar, the service was prompt. We ordered coffee's, Griddle Cakes and The Chop and Chicks. Took under fifteen minutes to get our food out. The food was hot and smelled amazing.\n\nAccording to my wife these are the best pancakes the ever! She almost couldn't put the fork down. They were really light, sweet and fluffy pancakes. It was served with a nice dollop of butter and warm maple syrup.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	4n0nYiAhMPtVoRbmtpdahg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The quality of the ingredients were high; however, the service was not so great. I felt that the waitresses were attempting to rush us out of the restaurant. I realize that it is a busy place, but their overt pushiness was not warranted. \n\nOverall I would not go back again. The food was made with great ingrediants, but it just didn't "do it " for me.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	dvaLCoQykxcTy8fwuUGvNQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
S7XDcjTPidEzH9IAkrkIEQ	5	2010-10-20 00:00:00	I LOVE this place and if I lived closer I would come here every day. I've had breakfast twice here with my boyfriend. I so want to branch out my order but both times I ordered the Hog and Chick with bacon and hashbrowns. Thick-cut, delicious peppered bacon and crispy on top, soft in the middle hashbrowns, what more could you want? The thick slices of toast with jam are a really nice touch and the honey lemonade is to die for. My boyfriend always gets the Five Spot breakfast sandwich that has eggs, bacon, onions and cheese on a fresh roll. De-lish! Next time we go I plan on trying the pancakes, I always eye them enviously when I'm there.\n\nWhen you get there, simply put your name on the list and the number in your party. The pad is usually on top of the water cooler by the door. Then grab a seat in the shade if you can find one and wait anxiously for your name to be called. Don't let the wait detour you, it's completely worth it. Now that it's cooling down the wait won't be so unbearable, especially if you're like me and want your weekend brunch around 1. (I've waited about 30 mins on average)\n\nThe restaurant is small and there are only a few tables but it doesn't feel crowded. The staff is super friendly and quick with your orders. You can usually hear some good tunes coming out of the kitchen. The prices are beyond reasonable for the quality of food that you get.\n\nYou will leave full, happy and extremely satisfied.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	tMz5_vct38pM04ItZhE20w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
s85307VxNPnhE8oPxxywQw	4	2012-02-11 00:00:00	As far as the food goes it is absolutely delicious. I had the special which was a 3 egg scramble with asparagus, top sirloin steak and fontina cheese and it was very tasty. One thing I really like about this place is that they have fresh squeezed orange juice. I love fresh squeezed orange juice and it is rare to find it in restaurants these days - or at least at the ones I have been going to :)\n\nThe glass of orange juice was awesome but it was tiny. There is also always a long wait here since the restaurant is very small and cannot accommodate very many people.\n\nI am deducting one star for the wait and the portions of orange juice, but the food was delicious - my wife and I ate every bite.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	s8aAfSEr8IZ4KlS5-Mks8Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
S9AylJlgXIVfX9SzobVmdA	4	2010-03-04 00:00:00	We'd always wanted to try this place out, especially after it gained fame on The Travel Channel. It's a literal hole in the wall in downtown Phoenix that's known for fabulous breakfast and endless waits. \n\n"Matt's Big Breakfast on N. First St. is a popular diner that serves heaping plates of Chop and Chick (pork chops and eggs). A local favorite, the small dining room fills up fast causing a line of early birds to pour out onto the street." - the Travel Channel\n\nEverything about this place could be described as, well, cute. The yellow door, tiny juice glasses with roosters on them, vintage art on the walls, even the waitress aprons. \n\nMy bf ordered the special; a concoction of eggs, hashbrowns and Andouille sausage in a hearty sauce. I opted for the waffle that came with A. the best butter I've ever had and B. some bacon. \n\nThe service was lightening fast once we were seated and the food was tasty. My waffle was by far the winner of our two entrees.\n\nWould I wait an hour to eat here again? Doubtful. Am I glad I got to experience it? Very.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	4Bn-2V-Mp3I3nLGkdI3J-Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

And I hate the feeling of being rushed through my weekend breakfast because they are more interested in turning over tables than me having a good dining experience.\n\nBut the food keeps me coming back. It is consistently good. They always prepare my food exactly how I request it. And I never leave a crumb to waste, which isn't usually the case.\n\nSa, as much as I hate to say it, Matt's is worth the wait.

The hostess was rude, after a mix up when she called me (the name she called before me didn't come so she went to seat me, but then realized that she said the name wrong so I waited ten more minutes and then she called tables who were after me), she told me "oh there's a table inside in the corner you can go now". I felt super rushed and that I was inconveniencing the restaurant. The waiter I had seemed not all there.

SJjddmxUZgrKA35carlZOA	2	2010-07-23 00:00:00	I've been to Matt's a couple of times now.  There is always a line.  Most recently I went on a Wednesday, which they will tell you is the slowest day,  and the line was shorter that day.\n\nMatt's is small, not in a quaint way, but in a cramped way.  I sat at the counter.  It's impossible to sit comfortably at their counter, because of the lack of leg room, but the other problem is that  they have put one too many chairs at the counter, so I was bumping elbows throughout my meal with my neighbors.  If you go by yourself, they won't let you sit at a table, so you're stuck at their crappy counter.  (don't get me wrong...I normally love to sit at the counter at a restaurant, as you get better and faster service)\n\nOne of my meals, the AZ scramble (a special) was pretty solid.  And I like the rosemary homefries.  Other meals (including the salami and eggs) weren't that remarkable.\n\nMatt's won't be my first, second, third choice for breakfast in the valley.  Too much trouble for inconsistent results.  If I want to wait in a line I'll go to Morning Glory Cafe, where the atmosphere is SO much better and the food is better.  If I don't want to wait in a line, there are many other breakfast places that offer good consistent food without a wait.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	8zmWTG2rUAfu5VuizRfg1Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

It's a true dive; it can only fit about 25 people, your really never going to avoid a long wait and it's nothing special on the inside.\n\nThat aside, the food is RIDICULOUS. The butter burger is easily the best burger I've ever had. It's incomparable. I got a side of country fries which were also insanely delicious and tried the waffles which were unmatched in quality. They actually added a slight seasoning to the waffles which give it a nice touch to the sweetness.\n\nHighly recommended!	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ddJ7Z3VRhx8MR3amxIS3nQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Sq0pvKrosqrJAB9eubvjBg	4	2012-06-11 00:00:00	Finally made it to Matt's Big Breakfast.  I was prepared to wait a bit so didn't really mind that part, but they do need more seats in the shade.  \n\nThe menu at Matt's is somewhat limited.  While I like to keep things simple and can easily get overwhelmed by those menus with zillions of options, I was annoyed by the 'no substitutions' policy.  There was a daily special posted on the board that had jalapenos and sausage.  I don't eat sausage, so I asked if I could get a vegetable instead.  The answer was no.  Okay fine.  Could they add jalapeno to one of the dishes that didn't come with sausage?  No.  Ugh.  I ended up ordering the cheese omelet and paying $1 each for onion and red peppers.  \n\nI couldn't get enough of the hash browns, although unfortunately they were probably loaded with butter.  Good thing I went to kickboxing that day.  Overall this is a cute little restaurant with great food.  Just be prepared to wait and plan on your food being made Matt's way, not your way.	4	1	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Rs-HbyVraRCP2X4ey1t-IQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
sQ2TWEezFFLvuW-prwT2PA	5	2007-02-26 00:00:00	For any of you that have been to Matt's and don't like it, no offense, but we wouldn't make a good breakfast eating team. \n\nBecause I love it. I had read and heard many a glowing review of this place from friends but the lingering question in the back of my mind was "How can bacon, toast, and eggs be that good?" Candidly, I still don't know the answer to that question. What I do know, however, is that it is, indeed, that good, if not better than I ever dreamed simple breakfast foods could be. \n\nThe line can be a formidable obstacle. There is a pad on top of the water by the front door where people write in the name of their party and number of people and you just wait for them to call your name into the tiny restaurant. I saw quite a few people outside, content to be waiting with a book, obviously knowing what they had in store.\n\nAs for the "too much butter" complaint from other reviewers, my advice is don't worry about it. If you want a light breakfast, Matt's isn't what you're looking for. For an obscenely delicious plate exploding with flavor and goodness, bring a book and post up at Matt's. It's worth it.	2	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	R4eLJKwG9yQ44vfwaUHS3g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
sQSzwi5zK0fdXvmthmKfWQ	5	2010-05-22 00:00:00	Coming from busy Los Angeles, California, this place is stellar in the mellow neighborhood of Arizona. A little mom n pop breakfast house. Little in size but big in name where I had to wait for 45 minutes. Yes!! just for a plate of breakfast. \n\nFriend and I got the pesto pork chop and the hash brown ham combination. Hands down best hash brown ever! Crispy on the outside but savory sweet potatoes on the inside. Eggs were huge and had a very sweet yolk...organic maybe. \n\nOverall was just very satisfying for a simple American breakfast. Nothing fancy but premium ingredients for solid goodness. Honestly best hash brown  and home fried potatoes I've had thus far. Caramelized and seasoned to perfection. I can really eat potatoes every day if this place was around town.\n\nStreet parking but it's not bad at all on a weekend. I'm glad I was able to swing by on my visit here. Definitely must try if you're close in town.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	HjzdgntLFvd8JiL44WBxkw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

One of the biggest pluses, Matt's actually knows how to cook hash browns, I didn't need to order them well done, they come nice and crispy as is.

They just moved to a great place up the street (where Verde used to be for locals) with more room so now everything isn't so crammed! Not that we all didn't enjoy their original house, this one just says, "I'm still awesome, I just stepped up a notch." Everything is delicious. I love their 5 Spot, the waffles are great, and their lunch specials are always amazing. If you like jelly - try their homemade stuff. Try the bacon.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	AoIqYDqqIk2pL5eS_abpCg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Note to owners: Your food is good enough,  your staff is great, so please save your money and move to a better location.  Right now, you're next to a rundown hotel with police baracade tape all over the place.The local residents(?) pan-handling all the waiting customers outside your place. Seriously?   Just sad.  Won't go again, won't recommend it either.  Good luck this summer, the heat will melt all your 'waiting area' customers out .	3	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	wQO8Rwn33b0Uqrnj0v3dCA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
SwqrDV5KXiojB1rGa9BM5g	4	2010-03-07 00:00:00	After a few times of walking past the group of hungry patrons waiting for their table at Matt's Big Breakfast, it was about time to stop in and try it myself. It was certainly worth the wait, and there is definitely nothing small about the breakfast. I had the special of the morning - three egg scramble with provolone, chicken sausage and spinach, and Sean S. had the griddlecakes. My scramble was the perfect mix of egg-y cheesy deliciousness for a Sunday morning breakfast. The home fries it came with were also mouthwatering. I think onions and fresh rosemary can make any potato taste good, and Matt's certainly had mastered this mix. I did try some of Sean's griddlecakes, and they were perfection - melt in your mouth, fluffy, and buttery. Finally, the service and the atmosphere were great. I don't think my waistline could handle Matt's often, but the breakfast is worth the indulgence occasionally.	3	0	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	HPuTCCL4W3u5sxrbBFu9YA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

szEfFSZ5nB7q83DfwqtrFg	5	2012-03-29 00:00:00	This is the idyllic breakfast stop for all you yelping food fanatics. Matt's is an upscale diner that will keep you believing breakfast really is the most important meal of the day; no matter how many carbs you just ate. My game plan was to order a meal and save half of it for later or even the next day; unfortunately, it was sooo good that I just couldn't stop.\n\nWhen they asked me what type of toast I wanted I half shrugged it off as just give me the "whatever" flavor and I won't eat it anyway. I generally stay away from generic tasting food in an effort to make my calories count for at the very least and awesome tasting meal.\n\nEven the toast was awesome! If they didn't bake the loaf of bread that my toast came from just as I was making my order, you could have foolded me. The hashbrowns were awesome, so much that I ate them all.  I wish I knew how to make my scrambled eggs taste like Matt does. You will not be dissapointed with any meal you order here.\n\nWords just don't give this breakfast joint justice, so be sure to check out all the pictures!\n\nExpect to pay about $10-11 per person after tax and tip for one of these awesome breakfast meals.\n\n**WARNING** Don't eat here if you are looking for just another breakfast place. **	10	5	5	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	8SgjU2fID9VqKQooFt1DIQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
T51bvq0ogKKZ0a8rNYechA	5	2011-02-24 00:00:00	As soon as we got word that class was canceled for the day we hit road with one destination in mind: Matt's Big Breakfast. This was my first experience with Matt's; my classmate is a little more cultured that I am, so he knew the ropes from previous experiences. \n\nThere really isn't a lot that the general public can use for parking near the restaurant, but I used my university parking pass to park in the ASU lot right across the street. Even though we went on a Tuesday morning the place was still packed. But the 20 minute wait wasn't bad because the weather was as nice as the outdoors waiting area. \n\nOnce we were seated (in pretty close quarters I might add) our waitress took our drink orders almost immediately. I got the honey lemonade which was such a great (and different) combination. \n\nMy classmate and I ordered the same breakfast entree: the five spot sandwich with a side of homestyle potatoes. Sweet Mary, the bacon on the sandwich was literally perfect. Everything tasted fantastic and complimented each other so well. \n\nI will eat here again whether or not my class has been canceled!	4	0	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	naGcg_vi336QxcuyvBHSkw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

It's not as long if you go a little earlier in the morning. \n\nThe service is great.

tF8nk0aNlJArxdU5j0yY4Q	5	2009-01-30 00:00:00	OK, I've wanted to try Matt's for a while, but I had drivien by and seen how small it was and heard of the long lines to get in. When I get up, I'm hungry and ready to eat...\n\nI happened to get up early last Saturday and thought "Hey, maybe I can get a seat at Matt's if I get over there early!" In a few minutes, my companion and I were on the road and on the way to Matt's as fast as her little Scion XB could carry us...\n\nMy master plan was a success and we were seated within minutes of arriving. I ordered the Chop & Chick, and my friend ordered the special which was a scramble with chicken sausage, cheese, and greens.\n\nWe were seated at the window bar and enjoyed several cups of good diner coffee (nice and strong, without being bitter) while we waited... \n\nand waited... and waited...\n\nWe noticed several tables come and go while we were waiting and as we were starting to get worried, Matt came to our table and apologetically told us that our ticket had fallen and gotten lost for a while and that our food was their top priority at that point. In the next five minutes, I'm pretty sure that every employee came by to apologize to us and ask if there was anything that they could get for us.\n\nWhen our food did arrive is was steaming hot and delicious. \n\nThe Chop & Chick was exactly as one would expect. Perfectly cooked over-easy eggs, no gooey whites, but plenty of liquid yolk with which to dip my home fries in. The pork chop was of average breakfast size, but cooked well and still nice and juicy.\n\nMy companion's special scramble was so good that it made me question my undying love of the majikal animal (pork) and the hash browns were awesomely crispy (but begging to be covered in gravy ;-)\n\nAs we ate, Matt came by and apologized again for losing our ticket and asked us to enjoy our breakfast on the house. It was so good that I kinda felt bad about taking them up on their offer, but I decided that I'd make it up to them by going out of my way for more early breakfasts there.\n\nSo, was it a perfect breakfast experience? No.\nBut the manner in which the mistake was handled, the professionalism of the staff, and the quality of the food puts Matt's Big Breakfast at or near the top of my Phoenix breakfast list.	2	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	OTv8RlbCh9S23lbHmXQHbw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

TlxRaglelCocoKIhIBlxPw	4	2010-10-15 00:00:00	I have found that during the summer on a Sunday morning before 930 is the best time to go to Matt's....at least that is my favorite time.   Why you may ask? No wait!  I have yet to wait in line at all when I go that early.  But mostly I have been by myself and I find a seat at the counter.  \n\nWhile I scan through the specials, I find myself more often than not, getting the Hog and Chick with Bacon and Hashbrowns.  I have tried the sausage patties and the ham.  I was not impressed by the saugage and while the ham is VERY good, the bacon still wins out.  The hashbrowns alone keep coming back for more and I am not a big potatoe fan.\n\nBut I admit I am spoiled living just a few blocks away....	7	5	5	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	gH3JDpHQfVcMEGaAaCJPjA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Found it by accident over the weekend and have never been so happy.  Ive been looking for a good greasy spoon breakfast place since i moved here and this place is great.\n\nIts small, there will be a line, but its so worth it.  I got the 5 spot (SUPER thick bacon, REAL eggs, onions, cheese on a roll) and my boyfriend got the griddlecakes, it was delicious.\n\nThe waitresses were nice, the place was clean which i imagine is a chore considering the cramped quarters, and the food is just awesome.\n\nIts casual, you should show up early, and 2 people can eat very well for under 20 bucks.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	B--5Ih8GxneIQNSuHTnwUA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

With that said, dishes with eggs and home fries were excellent. The chops were dry and not really flavorful. We sat at the counter and the service was efficient without feeling rushed. I liked this place, but the wait and the metered street parking doesn't make this a very convenient option for a weekday breakfast.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	hyJiSA9B91qAzRXvMus62A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

It was about 15-20 minutes so it was not too bad, and definitely worth it. The place is just so cute inside. The bread was amazing and the preserves were awesome. I love that they only cook with real butter and olive oil. The husband loves green Tabasco on his eggs (any pretty much everything else) and they didn't have any so that was a bummer but the food was very fresh.

I ordered the special which had eggs, ham, Fresno peppers, and cheese and came with hashbrowns. Everything was absolutely delicious. Their toast, as well, was a huge highlight. We didn't wait long because we called beforehand and were put on the list. They don't really have a host/hostess, you just write your name on the list, which I found interesting. I spent most of the meal gawking at one of their employees, Travis, who was absolutely adorable. I wish they had eggs benedict, but the food they had definitely made up for it.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	06gL9VaAyAl6WoYVu_nPuA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

It'll be good not great.  \n\nI love breakfast so I'd combed the Internet for breakfast joints to visit while in Phoenix.  Matt's Big Breakfast was near the top of the list.  \n\nFinally made it there today with my mom - not the most adventurous eater but game for a good experience.  She was turned off by the flies and the heat inside the restaurant but did enjoy her tuna sandwich and potato chips.  The tuna was tasty - light, not too soggy, not too much relish or add-ins.  It tasted pretty fresh and the bread was delicious - definitely not just out of a plastic bag.  The chips were a little cool but the pepper was a nice addition.\n\nI've read complaints about the coffee and I'd agree it wasn't that good.  Not awful but if you're open to other beverages I'd say grab something else when you're there.\n\nI had two eggs over easy, whole grain toast, and hash browns.  The hash browns were some of the greasiest I've ever eaten (and I eat a lot of hash browns) but at least we're dealing with real butter and olive oil at this place.  The potatoes are grated really fine which perhaps adds to your ability to see all the grease.  They were greasy but tasty.  Still, the home fries on a plate nearby looked equally, if not, more tasty.  The eggs were fine and the bread was delicious. I had to order everything a la carte because the only two egg breakfast on the menu involved bacon.  \n\nThere are mostly 2 seater tables though they can pull up an extra chair to some of the tables but if you've got a larger party, prepare to wait. There's also counter space for people who are open to sitting at the counter.\n\nIf you go around 1:30 pm, there's definitely no wait! :)\n\nThe service was friendly though not particularly helpful.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ofuB0zXK8QAXuynpO-iWmw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
u8ega20C8Bi4LRo2cZWz1w	5	2009-03-04 00:00:00	There isn't much to say about Matt's other than they have the best damn breakfast in the Valley.  You have to appreciate a homegrown diner where the owner makes everyday appearances, his wife runs the place, and they use the best, freshest, local ingredients.  Kudos.\n\nI get the Hog and Chick every single time I go, I never stray.  Eggs over medium, hash browns, wheat toast, and the best damn bacon ever.  Always perfect every time.  I have never tasted bacon so good in my life.  The hash browns are out of this world.  They get shredded super fine and are cooked up on the griddle in loads of butter.  The BEST.\n\nIf you want to seem cool and in the know, at lunch time order the Insider Burger.  It's a traditional burger smothered in cheese, bacon added, and topped with an egg.  My brother loves it.  Similar to a Royal Red Robin Burger, but obviously superior.\n\nThe only negative is the wicked crowd that can form for breakfast.  Bring a lot of water with you and some sunscreen if you can brave the summer wait.\n\nSimply put, this place is amazing.  I am so lucky to be so close to this place.  Sometimes to avoid the wait, my husband and I wake up at 6:30 on a Saturday morning, head over for breakfast and beat the crowds.  After a hearty button bursting breakfast, we ride our bikes home and go back to sleep.  That is the life my friends.  You should try it.	4	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	XNSyl47aXuPsvC5zXm5uhw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

UebSkad7dIRhc_h110-SeA	3	2010-03-09 00:00:00	We were visiting AZ this past weekend, and decided to try Matt's based on all of the great YELP reviews.  After an hour of waiting outside in the rain, the host called our name and said, "we'll be seating you shortly" and handed us menus.  He then came out 5 minutes later and said he was going to take our orders so he could get the kitchen started.  When we were finally seated (at the counter - not even a table) our food was served in about 10 minutes.  It was good (a little greasy) but I would never again wait an hour for breakfast.  Also, they don't have a bathroom in the facility.  You have to go next door!	2	2	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	O7hVHYuHj3pqk79UYlJEGw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

When we had a mistake on an order, the waitress rudely confronted us instead of being accommodating.\n 4. I had to wait over 5 minutes (after the rest of my party had walked out) just for them to notice I was waiting for the check. And last when I paid the bill they did not bother to ask how everything was.

uIgqjF4zgYwKQV5gb4ai-w	5	2010-06-19 00:00:00	This is the best breakfast I've ever had.  Period.  The food was SO good that it totally outweighed the wait outside on a hot day.\n\nYes, you WILL wait if you come here, but it is absolutely worth it.  The staff here are quite adept at quickly moving people through the restaurant without making anyone feel terribly rushed, and other than your wait to get seated, you won't wait long on anything else.\n\nMost breakfast places excel at one or two things, usually the sweeter side of breakfast (pancakes, waffles, etc).  I don't tend to eat a lot of these, so I'm stuck getting some half-toasted toast, eggs, and potatoes.\n\nNot here.  Here everything on their menu looks good and is even better in execution.\n\nI did end up ordering the toast, eggs, and potatoes, to be fair, but I still can't forget just how good they were.  The toast was a whole-grain variety, thickly sliced, nutty, and perfectly toasted.  It was served with butter and jam, and it was so good that I was reluctant to let my friend try any of it.  The potatoes were crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside, but both the toast and the potatoes paled in comparison to the eggs.\n\nYes.  Eggs.  Matt's Big Breakfast earns my nod as the best breakfast joint I've ever patronized because of their eggs.  They were scrambled, but something about them was so mouthwatering that I was disappointed when I finished them.   Most scrambled eggs at other restaurants are served cold, dry, chewy, or any number of other unappetizing ways.  Not at Matt's.  I'm sure they cooked them in butter or something equally as awful for you but, damn, were they ever good.  To this day, nearly a year later, I still have not had better eggs anywhere else.  Believe me, I've tried.  Nothing beats Matt's.\n\nEverything else looked amazing, and they frequently feature specials.\n\nThis is the Pizzeria Bianco of breakfast in Phoenix.  Long waits, but a must-attend for each and every Phoenician.	4	0	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	k2T4KX9ggC7oThV0H4mktg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Ernie the owner has become a great friend and is an awesome example of someone who has connected with the culture of urban Phoenix. The only drawback which is also Matt's strength is that it is a small place good for only groups of 4 or so. I have had Matt's all to myself with bigger groups of 20 but it requires planning ahead. I suggest going with either the Hog and Chick or try the waffles.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	KGWN_yv5FAlLVUJqTkCsTg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Another 30 minute wait for food, but I thought it was pretty worth it.\n\nTheir special for the day was a three egg scramble with chicken artichoke sausage, organic baby spinach and mozzarella cheese. Very unique and executed quite well - loved the sausage and the freshness of the spinach.\n\nThe hash browns were a litte strange (like what would happen if you pressed a potato through a spaghetti-making pasta machine) but nice and  crunchy on the outside.\n\nMy wife got the ham and eggs. These were also good, with nicely salted ham.\n\nWe also had a side of bacon, which was well peppered and cooked almost to a crisp.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	5Lwp4dv_yxLYoh9zihelWA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I tend to stay away during the summer months cause I sweat like a fat kid in a cannibal camp and would rather not wait the hour or so it takes to be seated. \n\nVery few places in town do I feel as "at home" as I do at Matt's. The staff is always friendly as are most of the patrons. For such a long wait and for the patrons to be in such good moods they have to be doing something right! The food is fantastic. I love how they find locally grown and raised food and only stock what is in season. The food alone makes Matt's one of my favorite spots for breakfast in town, but its the consistency in the ambiance that makes it my #1 breakfast spot in town.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	7bMJApc_Qsyr3r5y8s4_tA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I really enjoyed the daily special, which changes every day. Also enjoyed the waffles. Wife and daughter enjoyed the usual eggs and hashbrowns. Very friendly service would come again!	3	2	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	UG4EKu13JRwzRix6ESINdg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
UpqleiZ0UP4_XHKEaHbD8A	5	2009-10-03 00:00:00	Ok.  I'm finally getting in tune with Yelp and I'm writing a long overdue review of one of my favorite restaurants of all time-Matt's Big Breakfast.  When I think of what is important to me in a restaurant, it's two things plain and simple-food and service-and Matt's excels at both.  Honestly, these are the type of people, Matt and Ernie and their staff, that America's needs more of...good hearted, honest, hard working people who give a shit about their customers.  They're as American as Apple Pie!  \n\nThe food: everything on the menu is very good but in my mind two things stand out and they are as good as it gets in Phoenix...the waffle and the cheeseburger.  Oh, and the bacon.  A cheeseburger brushed with butter.  Get the fuck outta town.  This is the mother fuckin shit y'all.  I consider myself a burger afficianado and this burger is the bombay.  \n\nThere is an occasional wait because Guy Fieri pimps this place on the Food Network all the time but hell, why wouldn't he, it's the shit.  I pimp it all the time myself.  I may get a Matt's Big Breakfast logo on my pimpstick it's so good.  The best times to go are during the weekdays in the early morning around 7AM or after 1:00PM.  \n\nGoGOGOGOGOGOOGOG....you'll be glad you did!	3	3	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	tTnSnlNMWc5GILdvLgih7A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
uQXsMbzYmBsuI4p02HELOg	4	2010-08-28 00:00:00	My husband surprised me with breakfast take-out here a few weekends ago and I was a giggling mess. I had the perma-grin waiting for him to get back with my favorite item, the Salami Scramble. It is scrambled eggs mixed with sliced salami, with their awesome thick toast and your choice of hashbrowns or home fries. The jelly they give with the toast is delicious, as well. I can't say I am a huge fan of the potatoes as both the home fries and hashbrowns tend to be really greasy. That's okay, though, because the rest of the food is great. They also have thick-cut bacon you can order on the side that is pretty wonderful. I have eaten in the restaurant, sometimes, and I never had to wait too long and usually the wait seems to go by fast. Inside, the service is pretty efficient which at times can seem like they are pushing you out. But everyone is really friendly. I love that the farmer's market is right across the street which is great if you want to get out and have a nice breakfast before hitting the market. Matt's is closed on Mondays, FYI. Don't be like me trying to hit it up on a Monday off and throwing the collossal temper-tamptrum in the parking lot.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Y_2jMUKz6pvJ0JSWG3u10A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

uUJ8J_WHzblONm_YkNoAEA	4	2011-06-15 00:00:00	I'm going to sum up my own experiences and some Pros and Cons for people from reviews already posted, to give people a good starting information point.\n\nI had the Chop and Chick.  It was great.  If you like breakfast pork chops, this one is top of the line.  The breads and jellies are great too.  The hash browns, crispy and buttery.\n\nWhat I did not like is getting FLAT OUT RIPPED OFF with the TINY, TINY glass of fresh-squeezed orange juice they offer for $2.50.  I mean it's literally only about 3-4 ounces.  Tiny.  Grossly overpriced.  It's like they priced it like that to DISSUADE people from buying it.  Hate this about Matt's.\n\nPros:\n\nFresh, local ingredients, well-prepared and tasty.\nMany people say this is the best restaurant breakfast they have had, or among the best.\nPeople LOVE the buttery, crisp hash browns, and the home fries get a lot of praise also.\nAlthough the wait can be long, many people say it's totally worth it.\n\nCons:\nThe wait can be soul-crushingly long.  The place is TINY.\nStupidly overpriced orange juice. Fresh-squeezed, but JEEZ !!!\nTiny parking lot also.\n\nSo, ingest all that info, and decide if Matt's is for you.  \n\nHappy Yelping !!!	2	0	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	jfGevhcYLxY13Fa3drpzoA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
uWi47Ebcm-oGdnfObhe4yg	4	2013-01-14 00:00:00	The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that it's a victim of it's own success. My husband and I used to frequent all the time, but now that it's become so popular, we refuse to wait an hour for brunch, even on the weekdays. If you do decide to wait it out, the food is amazing, and the home fries are worth the wait alone. Very friendly wait staff, and cute place, albeit very small..	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	XGgL1mTvvD5w6Mc1bRnfdw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
UYXSP-1uki8Li7it-HjRBA	4	2006-09-23 00:00:00	Would you like some food with your butter?\n------------------------------\nFinally made my way down to Matt's Big Breakfast with some friends. We got there at about 10:30 and waited about 10 minutes for a table for 3, so that was pretty good, considering how small the place is.\n\nThe cute and feisty waitress got us all coffee, plus I got the OJ (Sarah K's review was spot on - it really is a tiny glass with half of it pulp). I ordered the cheese omelette with mushrooms & sauteed onions, sided with home fries and wheat toast. My friends got the hog & chick and a cheese omelette, both with well-done hash browns. We then ordered a plate of griddle cakes to split three ways. \n\nThe food soon was laid in front of us. All I can say is, I hope you like butter. Because butter was everywhere. I came prepared though, armed with my quiver of Lactaid pills. So bring it on, Matthew. I'm ready.\n\nThe food was great. Omelette was perfect and the home fries, seasoned with rosemary, were excellent. The griddle cakes were perfect for me, since I'm a big fan of the real maple syrup and light, fluffy flapjacks. My friends were fans of their hash browns, completely crisp and crunchy on the outside, and runny with butter on the inside. I'd never seen hash browns like this before, but I took a biteful to see for myself and the verdict? Really, really good. My friends enjoyed their meals, and our coffees and water were always being refilled, which was a great plus, along with our ongoing bantering with the waitress. \n\nDefinitely a great place to start off your Saturday morning.	2	3	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	AKXqbuifvfvNEpr3Qs51hQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
uzbvE60U8mm8apVvSTm83g	3	2009-11-11 00:00:00	We went on a Sunday afternoon, the wait was 45 mins for 4 people. We waited because everyone keeps talking about it. Man, was I starving to death when we were seated. I had the ham and cheese omelet and everyone shared an order of waffle with everyone else. The omelet was good. The waffles were light and fluffy. Good but not to die for. I personally think it was over hyped. It is good breakfast food, not GREAT.	3	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	iDlkZO2iILS8Jwfdy7DP9A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
v3thNL79UJvuS8aV4KfNuQ	4	2012-02-27 00:00:00	Bacon? Outstanding.  Griddle cakes?  Crave-worthy.  Home-fries?  Awesomely awesome.  Service?  Ehhh.  Love this little joint tucked into a one-bedroom house!  The food was amazing -- I can still taste those griddle cakes, BUT the service left something to be desired (more about that later).  My hubby got the three-meat scramble with hashbrowns, and it came with a tortilla.  He gobbled it down, apparently it was really good.  We never got any hot sauce, after two requests.  I ordered the two-egg breakfast with bacon.  The bacon was to die for, the best I think I've ever had.  The thick sourdough toast which accompanied my meal was served with real butter and fresh strawberry jam.  The combo was killer!  All in all, a fantastic breakfast!\n\nAbout the service -- The female waitress who greeted me at the door specifically told myself and two other parties that were waiting that they ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES, no waiting at the table for someone else to show.  She must have said this three or four times.  I pointed to my hubby, who was parking the car across the street and told her he'd be here in just a minute, and she reiterated, WE ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES.  I was told to add my name to a list outside, even though he was 30 seconds away!  An older woman appears at the door and asks for a table, and tells the waitress her husband is parking the car.  "Oh, okay, I can get you a table right now," says the waitress.  No "WE ONLY SEAT ENTIRE PARTIES."  No "ADD YOUR NAME TO THE LIST OUTSIDE EVEN THOUGH HE MIGHT BE HERE IN 30 SECONDS."  Noooooo.  Instead it's "Oh, okay, I can get you a table right now."  GRRRRRR.  I piped up and said, "Oh, here he is.  We're ready now."  The waitress responds, "I'm going to get her a table, I'll be right back."  GRRRR.  I HATE people who say one thing and do another.  I was seeing red at this point, but the place is so danged small I couldn't tell my hubby what I was so pissed off about!!!  Anyhow, the waitress "that wouldn't seat us" buzzed our table once or twice, and I asked for water THREE TIMES before a very kind gentleman waiter got it for me.  They forgot my OJ -- he brought it out after I asked the other waitresses TWICE.  Hot sauce?  Never appeared on our table, even after two requests.  Just a tip -- the female waitresses were ditzy as hell.  Ask for a male waiter!!  (sorry if that sounds sexist, but I'm a woman and I know what good service looks like.  This was NOT IT.)\n\nMy rating above is based on the FOOD (5 STARS) minus one star for the SERVICE (TWO STARS).  (I know, I know, five minus two is three, but I just couldn't bring the food rating that low, It was THAT GOOD)  In fact, I think I'm heading out now for some of those griddle cakes.  From a male server.  See ya!	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	tEZLN3gP0jwfP2ugFyuuMQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
v7yC0puZoc3iO_Ons0493A	5	2009-01-22 00:00:00	i know the real secret to Matt's Wu-tang Style. \n\nsome people may think Matt's is over rated. but i know that to be false. Matt's is THE BEST BREAKFAST...period. there has not been a single time i was unhappy with the service, price, or wait. \ni would wait an hour, heck two hours if need be. \n\nthe 5-spot is by far my favorite breakfast item. its like a full on taste cell orgy. with over 50 taste cells per taste bud and a human tongue containing several million taste buds you have to figure that is alot of ecstasy in your mouth. \n\nif i could justify the time spent waiting as a business expense i would be there every morning. \n\nMatt and Erenia have a great thing going here.	9	5	6	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	NMmu4oC-YRqdi0WY9pV78g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
V9oIh7dw9plurMs6q0yYvA	5	2010-03-08 00:00:00	Coming back from the airport after dropping off the wife, my son said "Dad, I want a GOOD breakfast"....  well my little foodie had a great idea, so I decided to take the advice of Yelp and stopped in at Matt's Big Breakfast.  \n\nOk, my first reaction to following my GPS device's guidance was "woah...I really don't need to get hit up for spare change today".  But once I decided that the neighborhood was ok, I decided to just forget about the surroundings, and give Matt's a try.  I am so glad we did!\n\nService:  Quick, friendly, and accurate!  An instant plus!\n\nFood:  I had a basic eggs and meats breakfast with hashbrowns.  The highlight was the bacon (OMG was it good) and the sausage (WOW!)\n\nMy son had the salami scramble and man did he chow!  He immediately noted we needed to come back and bring mom.\n\nThe orange juice was clearly fresh squeezed and was just great!!!\n\nWhat can I say, the reviews I read were right.  This place rocks!  It was very much worth five stars!\n\nOh, and don't park in the ASU lot or Barney Fife will give you a lecture like he did to me today.  This annoying little man was literally clicking his heels (jackboots) to lecture me about not parking...and I had to tell him to cut to the chase...as his lecture was going on forever.	4	2	4	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	faaOI6hU64h6SSaF0f11eg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
V9rKv-XOjv266AdKx6cjKw	5	2012-03-31 00:00:00	Okay, I admit it - we are waaaaay late to this party. We tried once before but the hour-plus wait was just two much for the four starving carnivores with me that day. This time our strategy was to go early on a Saturday morning as close to 6:30am opening as possible. We arrived around 7:15 (it WAS the weekend after all) and only waited about 20min for a table for two. \n\nI had the special of the day - 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese - YUM! The sausage had just the right enough of bam and the home fries with rosemary and onions rocked. My companion had the hog and chick - awesome meaty bacon with that.\n\nGreat value for the price - I packed up at least half my meal for the starving teenagers at home (who could not be roused at dawn). If you haven't been, get up early, bring a newspaper and rest assured Matt's Big is well worth the wait.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	_xe3NytMyOb8Y21JnA7Lwg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
VajA4GBqEfoPGzMyR3uf9g	4	2012-11-16 00:00:00	Finally got something I've never had at this place: Good service....obviously a Phoenix landmark that should be visited by all at least once, but new location loses some of the old charm.

Sure, there's a line out the door, but it's well worth the wait. Trust me.	2	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	gvyYZgFdBbcT3xGjWOvZag	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
vDqWIT9fS-LgVnN_9VthcA	4	2013-01-23 00:00:00	As soon as I found out I would be traveling to Phoenix, I began looking up places to eat. Matt's Big Breakfast was the first thing to crank up my Yelpdar!\n\nB R I E F  S U M M A R Y\n-- Probably the most reviewed/well known place in downtown Phoenix\n-- Featured on TV like everyone else said\n-- This newer location is a block further than the old (way bigger now!)\n-- Warm & welcoming ambience\n-- Friendly and attentive staff (seems like they have a system)\n-- I recommend coming early, only 6 tables @ 6:45am (Wed morning)\n-- Salami scramble was definitely unique but needed some cheese\n-- Potatoes had decent flavor (rosemary) but I wish I got hash browns\n-- Waffle was hot & fresh & syrup was high quality\n-- Sourdough toast was thick & good\n-- Strawberry preserves were delicious!\n-- The regular menu is very limited\n-- Staff recommends trying the specials\n-- Very sad I couldn't try the french toast, it's ONLY a special! :(\n\nWell I woke up super early because I didn't want to get stuck here and I had a meeting at 8am! I forgot that AZ is an hour ahead of CA. I woke up so tired and barely made it here at 6:45am. I walked from the Westin which was a healthy walk at 6 in the morning! I was a bit disappointed to find the old location but luckily I saw the new location was only a block further.\n\nI really like the feel and ambience of Matt's Big Breakfast (MBB). The wait staff were all ladies and they were all very friendly and attentive even at 6am! I was barely awake and I wasn't sure if I was going to come here again so I ended up ordering basically 2 dishes so I could try 2 things. My server loves the waffle so I had to get it. The special she also recommended but I'm just not a fan of apple sausage so I opted for the salami scramble. \n\nI'm from the San Francisco bay area so I'm almost accustomed to what MBB is doing with fresh, local ingredients. I applaud them for keeping their food quality so high but I wasn't uberly impressed because I'm sort of used to it. I expect to pay a decent amount of money for high quality food. I didn't feel like MBB was overpriced, I thought the prices were about right in my opinion.\n\nThe waffle was above average and I could taste the quality of the syrup. I really wanted the french toast but it wasn't being offered. To me, if you're famous for french toast, you should offer it on your menu! Nevertheless, the waffle is a good alternative. \n\nThe salami scramble was so unique and different. I've never had anything quite like it but I really wish they would have added some creamy cheese to smooth out the salami after taste. I think I added some ketchup or hot sauce to my potatoes and it helped balance the salami. If you like salami, I recommend. I probably wouldn't order again, I just was feeling adventurous. I was a bit surprised that the sourdough bread was so thick but it was still good. The preserves really enabled me to eat all of it otherwise it would been just too much bread for me.\n\nClearly this place is living up to the hype as it is the number 1 rated place in downtown Phoenix. I didn't search further than that because I didn't have a rental car or anything. I would definitely recommend coming here and if I'm ever out here again, I hope that I can grab some of their french toast!	3	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	-HBdisZOrgMdw08zCWZ_kg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

It used to be so easy to get a table too until Guy Fierri  had them on his show and now you wait at least 45 mins for a table.  But the food is so good OMG it is still worth it. It is so tiny but the food is huge!! The fresh fruit preserves on the homemade bread, the home fries with fresh rosemary and caramelized onions, yummy sunny side up eggs with a GIANT piece of ham.

This is one of the best breakfast I've had in years, from the fresh OJ, amazing Cave Creek Coffee, special three egg scramble with bacon, locally grown peppers and fontina cheese, with a tortilla and oh the rosemary home fries... drool. My family took me here and I would recommend this to anyone who lives in or is visiting Phoenix. Tuesday morning we waited about five minutes for a table. This really is the best quality local produce in a great little diner.

VgtwOFEHcgDSCCrEz3mJrw	3	2012-07-02 00:00:00	My friend recommended this place when she was visiting me in Phoenix because she heard about this place on food channel. It was on triple D's (Diners, Drive-in, Dives). We came here on a Sunday morning for a late brunch (around 1pm).\n\nWhen we arrived there, it was street parking. We were able to find a place on the street. The place is very small, it reminds me of a very casual, good home-cooking restaurant - not fancy but just good food.\n\nWe put our name on the list outside. For a party of two, our wait was about 30-45 minutes. It was long but it didn't feel too long. It was a hot day so we waited in the shade. The hostess that sat us was very nice. We sat at the bar. My friend ordered the scramble special and I decided to order the Chop and Chick with wheat toast, hashbrowns and over easy eggs.\n\nThey served water in a little jars which I love. It's so cute and it reminds me of a simple, home-cooked. I looked around to see what everyone else was eating, it seems like couples like to split the food because the portions are big. Hence, the name "Matt's Big Breakfast."\n\nService is quick. The waitress and waiters are attentive and they are constantly moving. The food came out in a decent time, it wasn't too long but not too quick. \n\nWhen our food arrived, I almost thought they forgot my toast with my order. I asked them about it but they assured they did not forget me. My pork chop tasted like a pork chop I can make at home. I was a pan-fried pork chop that was oily and greasy. It wasn't seasoned too heavily, it wasn't too salty or peppery. The hashbrowns were very oily as well. I would like the hasbrown to be more crispy than oily. It was softer than I like. The wheat toast came with homemade strawberry jam. The strawberry jam was very sweet and had a strong strawberry aroma, I like the jam. \n\nMy breakfast was decent, it wasn't spectacular or horrible. It was a little more oily than I expected. It is your typical homecooked breakfast, they didn't mess up my order or anything.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ttauTXuRemnMf1SDhMgQZQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
VI2uzbEro7CpfX36lzZPjA	4	2009-06-09 00:00:00	Finally got to try Matt's EARLY one Sunday morning with the family.  Luckily they arrived well before I did and I didn't have to wait very long.  The place is small, like previous posters have alluded too.  You don't get how small until you actually go.  10 tables and 7 seats at the counter, tops.  The waits can be long and now I know why.\n\nSo we were a party of 8.  The parents sat at a table and the "kids" sat at the counter.  The menu is simple with not a lot to choose from.  I heard the pancakes were great, but I like a little more substance with my breakfast.  I chose the special, 3 egg scramble with bacon, cheddar, and fresh jalapenos, rosemary home fries and a tortilla.  Not being a huge jalapeno fan I almost had them nixed from the order, but decided to go with it.  Glad I did.  It was great and the peppers added a nice little bit of heat.  The rosemary home fries were outstanding!  I know all of this sounds very simple and you could probably make this at home, but it always tastes so much better when someone else makes it!  \n\nI think this place is worth the hype!	3	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	LoKOWvUpjWsx3emo5B4g4g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

viDSVCbsTUe2H3qFE0Jcwg	5	2009-10-06 00:00:00	Whoa - what a bunch of spoilsports!  \n\nWhat's not to love about Matt's Big Breakfast (except for the wait)?  My friend and I are serious breakfast aficionados, hailing from Philly where we regularly b'fast at Sabrina's, Honey's, Carmen's Country Kitchen and Morning Glory Diner - all fine, glorious breakfast establishments.  Suffice it to say that neither of us are slouches when it comes to knowing a killer breakfast when we come across one - and he makes a mean frittata himself and I make sublime homemade buttermilk pancakes.  \n\nI read about Matt's online (altho I must say that I somehow fortunately missed the  ridiculously pretentious and nit-picky (too much rosemary for your retainer??? Get a life!) "yelp" reviews) so we decided to stop by for breakfast after flying in to Phoenix this past Saturday.  \n\nAs much as we love a good b'fast, we both despise a long wait ... but hey, we had nothing better to do and struck up conversations with other waiting souls and paid a visit to the nearby flea-bag Coronado Motel to use the restroom and soak up the atmosphere.  Matt's provides a cooler of flavored water and the time passed pretty quickly.\n\nIT WAS SO WORTH THE WAIT!  It's days later and I can still taste the perfectly light and fluffy (neither undercooked or overcooked) omelette, brimming with top quality cheddar cheese (who could imagine a basic omelette could taste so heavenly?).  The home-fries were bursting with flavor with the addition of rosemary, onions and peppers ... and the toast ... oh the toast ... homemade sourdough cut into thick slices, toasted and served with homemade jam.  My partner's special was eggs blended with some kind of slightly spicy sausage and cheese.  The coffee, too, is perfect, neither too strong or too mild and served with real cream and raw sugar.  \n\nService is fast, friendly and we were treated to the owner's adorable son seating guests and advising of the day's specials.  \n\nDidn't need to eat again until dinner - if you're in Phoenix, ignore the "yelp" twitwits - you simply MUST visit Matt's Big Breakfast.	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	vFyOJhlxAifmSqoBRBudHg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I thought it was pretty good but my wife did not like it becasue it was to greasy. she did not like the butter fat.  We did have to wait a long time to eat.  It's small and they had a lot of flies in the windows which was a big turn off.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	kXvo5xK2Kztz3gdIYixTJQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

VN-EV3qeuAS4kAh1ob9Big	5	2012-05-14 00:00:00	I had heard about this place since I moved here 3 years ago... But had been detoured by the long wait that comes with the fantastic reputation.\nI had some friends in town.. we ventured down there. We waited 45 minutes. We weren't expecting anything great by that point, but were committed to trying it.\nThe gave us menus in line & took our order, so that when we sat down finally, our food & drink followed immediately.\nAs doubtful as we were after standing that long, I have to say it was worth every minute. Down to the coffee, everything was spectacular. I ordered the special, steak and eggs. BEST BREAKFAST EVER!\nLike me, don't wait so long to try it and don't be discouraged by the long lines. It is phenomenal.	2	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	YtjIh9un3OPOsJmlKAtjYA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
vp0adLbIlf3RBESXzomZrg	5	2009-08-29 00:00:00	One of the best breakfast places in Phoenix. Arrived for a late Thursday morning breakfast (11am) and only had to wait 5-10 minutes. Server was friendly and I had the chorizo scramble special. It was great! Very tasty and flavorful. I am one of the pickiest breakfast eaters (i.e. I don't really consider US Egg & Denny's breakfast places). I expect my eggs and all the ingredients to be fresh, and that was certainly the case at Matt's!! This is one of my two favorite breakfast places in the valley (for different reasons, I consider Matt's and the Orange Table to be complimentary).	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	LBweMNqEoQi9_-7HhNcWQg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
vPJLPY2m--BIXxhJfSdDZA	5	2012-04-03 00:00:00	Wake up in the morning, food was on my  mind. Whats a good place to eat? "Heard the food portion at Matt's was astronomical!" Asked myself, Am I really that hungry? Yes, Yes I AM! \n\nKnowing that a trendy brunch place like this would attract a lot of locals and travelers. I had mentally prepped myself to wait an hour. But who knew Matt's big breakfast would be contained in such a small place. I had waited almost 90 minutes to be seated. Good thing it was breezy that day, or it woulda been pretty intense wait.\n\nOnce seated, pretty much knew exactly what I wanted to order until I saw the special. 3-egg scramble with andouille sausage, fresh local baby spinach and fontina cheese. Sounds amazing. Got an order of that and an order of the Hog & Chick w/ hash browns.\n\nThe 3 egg scramble\nDefinitely prettier dish of those 2. The presentation was definitely on point, the plate was full of fluffy eggs with melted fontina cheese on top. The rest of the plate was filled up with the country fries(potato). The bed of baby spinach added contrast to the plate. A dish that pleases the eye as much as the tongue. The andouille sausage/egg/fontina cheese was good combo. The flavor of all 3 really worked together, instead of fighting each other.\n\nHog & Chick w/ hash browns\nThis one was less aesthetically pleasing. But don't let looks fool  you. This piece of pork chop is mighty tasty. The hash was real good. They browned both sides of the hash, and added some other stuff. It was tasty and had good consistency. Wish the chop was a thicker cut. I'd pay more for a thicker cut.\n\nEverything here tasted good, and stood out from other diners. It was not expensive at all. But good food from a small place like that just means a long wait in line to be seated. I think they do take out. So'd recommend take out or showing up early.  But if I had to wait in line again, I would totally do it.	4	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	i6pCe_ObrsIniB8n1Dp9pA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Having said that, I have waiting in line more than once for breakfast here.  The food is delicious.  I'm not sure if its the copious amounts of butter in the food but I swear it is the best toast and breakfast potatoes in town.  Oh and the main dishes are great too.  The place is tiny, and they really didn't spend much money on decor.  But really, who cares when breakfast is this delicious?!	4	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	S5dGv1vID1hoBZm2A9fK5g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
VrpXiKfasCPPued5df8hsg	4	2011-10-14 00:00:00	While in Phoenix, walked to Matt's for breakfast on Saturday morning. Not being really familar with it, I had no expectations. We ended up having to wait over an hour to be seated - mostly because this place is really freaking small. (If you have a big group, you'll take up the entire restaurant and that's just rude.) The menu is pretty sparse, but has something for everyone. I got the hog and chick - with scrambled eggs (just ok), thick cut bacon (it was heavy on the pepper but good), hash browns (odd, the home fries looked better) and sourdough toast (next time, I'm just getting the toast. The sourdough was awesome). With a coffee, I think my total was around $10-11 - not too bad. \n\nOverall, if it was a random day during the week with no wait, I'd be more excited. I'm not sure it was worth the wait - but my cousin is still talking about how great it was.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	NppvXWEUC-4h6rIs9cmSUA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Einstein Bro's Bagels located downstairs, wasn't gonna satisfy our insatiable craving for some rib-stickin, home cooked food.  \n\nWhen we arrive, there are people milling about the exterior of this tiny restaurant, sipping orange infused water provided by the staff.  We assumed it must be excellent, if these people were willing to wait in the sweltering heat for a coveted seat.\n\nAfter 15-20 minutes, we feel like celebrities on the VIP list as we're escorted through the door.  I order the Hog & Chick, which provided more than enough hash browns, eggs, toast, and sausage to quell the lumberjack appetite I developed.  \n\nThe staff was friendly & fast, attentive to our dwindling water glasses and clearing plates quickly.  We were more than pleased with the meal, hospitality and price point--happy to walk a little of this hearty breakfast off, on the way back to the hotel.	2	3	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	FOBRPlBHa3WPHFB5qYDlVg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
vrrNBgBo-DNU5Z68qqXpLw	3	2010-06-27 00:00:00	Just got home from eating at Matt's Big Breakfast. Waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated which wasn't too bad. However, after trying the food, I don't think it would be worth it to wait beyond 15 minutes especially during the summer months to eat here. \nTo start, the menu is a little too small and was missing some key breakfast essentials I thought. Biscuits and gravy... Hello? Anyways, I decided on the chick and chop meal with hash browns, over easy eggs, and sourdough toast. The chop was really dry and tough and at times, flavorless. The eggs were cooked perfectly and the hash browns, though really greasy, were some of the best I have ever had. The toast didn't taste much like sourdough to me but the home made peach preserves were pretty legit. My husband on the other hand liked the toast. I also ordered a small fresh squeezed OJ. Maybe its just me but I almost felt I would have rather had something from a bottle. Something just didn't taste right to me about the OJ. Lots of pulp, so if you like to chew your OJ, then you might enjoy it. The husband opted for the special: 3 meat scramble with cheese and fresh jalapeno's, hash browns, and tortilla. He said it was alright but was a little weirded out that one of the meats was bologna. \nAll in all, the prices were not too bad. We felt they were a little skimpier on their portions than other places particularly with the amount of hash browns and the toast. For a place calling itself "big breakfast," I guess I expected more. Would we go back? Being that we are from Maricopa, this is pretty far for us to travel for breakfast so probably not anytime soon. The wait that is almost always present also doesn't seem worth it for a place that had nothing memorable to me other than their hash browns and peach preserves. Maybe if we are in the area and its not summer though...	0	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	F10QJk-i3IrUxKcJI9CF-g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

w1Cwjmi4ZU9I-qJWDYRTCA	4	2010-12-31 00:00:00	I really don't understand what people are ordering that they say that the serving sizes here are small. My meal came with a pork chop, 2 eggs, and hash browns, which I could barely keep all on my plate (it was so much food) and a side of thick sourdough toast (2 slices). Mike ordered the fives pot which was just a sandwich. Considering we had waited almost an hour for breakfast we also ordered a side of bacon (so yummy!) and one pancake so we could try a few other things. The people sitting next to me at the counter ordered the special omelet which also took up the whole plate. \n\nThis place is so tiny. There were three tables in the main eating area (which could seat 2-3 each), 6 seats at the counter, 3 more seats in the side room at a counter and two spaces where they could seat parties of about 4-5. \n\nAlthough it took quite some time just to get in (and you have to wait outside to be called, keep this in mind if  you are there on a cold day) it doesn't take very long to get your food. It took 10-15 minutes to get our food. By the time we finished they had already turned over all of the tables. \n\nThe staff was very friendly and the food was good. My pork chop was juicy and I loved the hash browns and bacon. Mike's five spot wasn't as tasty. The eggs were overcooked and a bit dry. He wished he would have had the pancakes instead. \n\nThey have some good eats.	6	3	5	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	045lA8joqI1vPm0wLgZPKw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
W2Q63mTI1XK4GmRtiyzKsg	3	2013-01-02 00:00:00	We have heard of Matt's Big Breakfast  many times since moving out here to Phoenix. Our family from other states have heard of this place as it has been featured on Travel Channel & Food Network. So we finally decided to give this place a try to see what the big deal was all about.\n\nMatt's actually moved down the street from their original location, which I had heard was very small. The new location which did appear much bigger, still had a long wait out side. There were a few benches that patrons can sit on & orange flavored water was offered outside for those waiting. \n\nThere was approx a 45min for out party of 4. Good thing we didn't come hungry. Once inside we were offered Bar seating, otherwise the wait would have been at least another 20 min. In my opinion, the bar stools were very slippery, or maybe it was just mine. I was wearing jeans, but I felt like I has to keep one leg on the ground in order not to slide off. & i'm kinda short so I was basically standing at the bar to eat.\n\nDefinitely a busy Breakfast spot. They state they use local resources & organic foods. \n\nThe food was tasty. I ordered the griddle cakes & they were BIG. I had to ask for more syrup which they said they would charge us another $1.50 for. \n\nNo one in our party was able to finish what we had ordered. We left with very full bellies. \n\nStill not quite sure what all the hype is about. The act of supporting Small Business?Yes, we will always try to do that. Or maybe I just needed to order something more adventurous?  Know you must come with a BIG stomach, but not hungry, because the wait is ridiculous. At least we can cross this place off of our Food Bucket list\n\nHappy Eating	5	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	V_U8eocoXUvUtPuqzIQo_Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
W5tHVq9DYmukMv0bsOeuGA	4	2012-08-13 00:00:00	Beginning the day as I do most, with a morning run well before the sun is up, the first stop on this 6-stop tour would be downtown - a place I've now discovered to be devoid of most signs of human life on a Saturday...except for a small parcel of land at 801 North 1st Street entitled "Matt's Big Breakfast" where a line of thirty or so was already waiting for the approximately 20 seats inside.  Having heard of the nearly decade old establishment owned and operated by Matt Pool during my first visit to Phoenix but unable to make it downtown before ten on any day during that trip (when lines reportedly top two hours despite triple digit temperatures) I have to admit that I really had not anticipated the line to be so long at 6:55am and for a moment I contemplated heading elsewhere, but with my books in hand and nothing better to do my curiosity won out and I added my name to the paper list and took a seat in the rapidly dissipating shade.\n\nSitting and reading while a pair of ASU students talked about having seen Matt's on (presumably a repeat) of Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins the previous night I tried to ignore them (and Guy Fiere's existence in general) while a few people trickled out of the restaurant and with my name at least ten parties down on the list I was surprised when it was called - the solo diner benefit, it seems, landing me an end seat on the counter only fifteen minutes after I arrived and given the expedient service at Matt's a fortuitous happening that had me leaving the restaurant before the aforementioned students had even entered the doors.\n\nSeated at the counter with a menu I'd already memorized in hand and a daily special that held little interest I perused the interior - small, stark, but efficient and exceptionally clean - before my server filled my water glass, offered me coffee, and fielded a pair of questions prior to taking my order and handing it over to the kitchen less than five feet away.  With the space tight and my location literally on the verge of the kitchen and the pass it would not be long before my coffee was filled - a single pour that I subsequently sent back due to a combination of thin mouth-feel, acrid flavor, and no artificial sweetener - and even less time before my stool would be bumped into for the first of thirty times...to say the least this is not a place I'd choose to linger.\n\nSeated and watching the action of the kitchen as plate after plate came through the window and regular after regular chatted with Matt's wife at the cash register it would not be long before my order would arrive and with the restaurant's strong dedication to local/organic/fresh sourcing the items that were presented quickly made me realize why so many people deal with long waits and less-than-comfortable seating to experience Matt's Big Breakfast - the food is really quite excellent, beginning first with a perfect hotcake served with pure maple syrup and far too much (or perhaps just the right amount of) butter for $2.75.\n\nMoving from the dainty golden flapjack to something more substantial, my second dish would actually consist of two plates and four items in the form of "The Chop & Chick" - an $8.95 breakfast comprised of a Pan Seared Iowa Pork Rib Chop with 2 Poached Eggs, Hash Browns, and Whole grain Toast with Blueberry Rhubarb Jam.  Apparently their most 'famous' dish it is a little difficult to decide which aspect of the plate was the best considering the quality of perfectly poached eggs (something even good restaurants tend to overcook,) crisp yet buttery potatoes and lightly herbed juicy pork chop but in the end I think I would have to give the nod to the toast - hand cut thick, rife with seeds and a rich earthiness, and topped with house made preserves featuring what seemed to be no sugar at all but rather the essence of blueberries with a slight savoriness from the rhubarb...a strong contender for best jam/preserves I've ever encountered and reason enough to revisit Matt's when it moves to its new digs a few doors down (and hopefully decreases wait times and seat bumps...and perhaps finds a coffee roaster whose beans better compliment the quality of the food.)	6	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

However, the menu is limited and overall, our selections were merely good - not great. Our rosemary potatoes were under cooked and the eggs were far too runny. I would have understood this had it been busy, but it was just after noon and the cook was not overburdened at all. I would go back if the wait is a few minutes, but I would never stand around for a half hour plus for a table.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	u_DZZzDAtCzsitoL1kpzlQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

There's a bird whistling a happy tune while the patrons come in and out of this small red brick building. When you cross the threshold to the other side, you are greeted the the diner atmosphere to the smell of fresh bacon.\n\nFreshly squeezed OJ & lemonade are on the menu w/ the freshest ingredients known to man kind.. Hence due to the caption on the back of the menu with the smell of waffle & bacon waffling around my senses. \n\n-Did I mention the smell of bacon? ..probably Ooh three or four times already. That's how good it smells while tantalizing my sense of smell.\n\nI can't wait to get in the door to the kingdom that's is Matt's.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	v-eObkYlpCq8xsVwsvYEzg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
WASM0Eq0bKootfec_6h0kQ	2	2011-07-11 00:00:00	First off, lemme just say that this review reflects neither on the quality of the food (fresh) or the service (excellent).  But seriously, I've had better.  Contrary to other reviewers, Guy Fieri is not the savant of Flavortown the Food Network makes him out to be.\n\nMom really wanted to try this place, particularly the "Chop and Chick" porkchop and eggs dish that Guy had on DDD here and the reason his face is tie-dyed sprayed on the wall with the words "Guy Ate Here".  We altered our exit strategy from the Armpit of America (aka Phoenix - 120 degrees at 8am, no sir!) just to sample this mythically delicious dish.\n\nThe parking lot is the size of a postage stamp, and while there are several sizable parking lots nearby, you can't park there because it's private property and Phoenix PD don't mess around.  Which leaves metered parking along the streets.  a quarter earns you 10 minutes at Matt's Big Breakfast, and the wait time is about fifty cents on a good day.  You sign your party up on the list near a ceramic pig by the door.\n\nThe restaurant itself is exceedingly small.  Get to know your neighbors, you'll definitely be talking to them at some point in your meal.\n\nI had the organic chocolate milk which tasted exactly like the kind I have at home, an omelet with no special ingredients to set it apart from a Denny's omelet and Belgian waffles that weren't much better than the kind I buy frozen at Costco.  The menu at this Matt's location (I was told there are three around the Phoenix area, each with a more expansive menu than this location) is very limited and the ingredients are too.  No substituting fresh fruit, they don't have any.  That Chop and Chick that cost us $3.00 in metered parking?  I doubt Mom would have given it 2 stars.  Overall, it wasn't a terrible experience, but it wasn't something I'd do again.	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	z7GkXK4o0dOxjDzh3AWgHg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Wbgk79U3DX7f66EZBfEn1A	3	2011-06-09 00:00:00	Hmmmmm, another place I heard about for years. Movie stars love it! Locals love it! Food critics love it! I am not a breakfast food eater for breakfast so I figured I would never try it. Hey, I am OK with Denny's or McDonalds for Breakfast! I knew I had to go when the gentleman sitting next to me on the plane recently told me that he purposely landed a layover in Phx just to try the darn place. ( I am like," Really"? But then I thought I might do the same over a great NY pizza sooooooooo I cut the guy some slack-lol) So when I found myself Downtown yesterday I stopped by. Ok, right away I had issues. Nowhere to park. I found a spot on the street and paid 2 bucks for metered parking.( And worried about a break in since the neighborhood is real bad)  We are not starting off well. I then walked the two blocks to the restaurant. Being 10:30 am on a Tuesday I figured the normal 1-2 hour wait would not apply to me, yet the place was not dead. ( Hmmmm, good sign in today's economy) I had to sit outside for a little while but the wait was less than 10 minutes and the woman who worked there was very nice.                                                                                                              The place is an old dive. Now don't get me wrong I love old buildings. Super fan of Coronado Cafe, Teeter house, and other old houses renovated into eating establishments but this place is not one of those. Frankly, it is pretty gross. Small and old looking with uneven floors. It only has 6 tables  or so and a tiny bar. No wonder the wait. The menu only has 6 things on the Brkfst side and 5 or so on the lunch side. I ordered a Salami Scrambled Egg plate with Rosemary potatoes.Maybe I  am not an EGGSpert so I couldn't tell what the big deal was and why they are quoted as being so much better than elsewhere. Now, they are cage free eggs and cooked in butter. They tasted good but I didn't like have a heart attack or moaning fit over them or anything. The Rosemary Potatoes were good but nothing I would wait in line hours for. I have had better. The coffee tasted average. Now, the bread was a different story YUMMERS! Smashing! I asked them if it was homemade and they said they get it at Wildflower Bakery. Soooo I am thinking to myself there are plenty of those in town. I will just go there next time. No wait or parking issues. I ordered an egg salad sandwich to go. Which was delish, BTW and the Homemade Mac salad was outstanding. So, my foodie fingers type, What's the big deal? Did I order the wrong thing? Why the fuss? What am I missing here?  It was very good I agree but Oprah and Guy Fierro????? REALLY? The service was fine. Everyone was nice.  I did go off hours so small wait. I honestly don't know how it made the Food Channel or why people wait three hours in the heat to eat here.  \n   I would go back sure but if I had never heard of the place I wouldn't have ranked it even in the top 100 of my favorite dining experiences.	2	2	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
wfiqTr8U-iba3w3pjTkfBA	5	2012-12-04 00:00:00	When I am in the mood for an omelet, hash browns and sourdough, this is my new go-to place! I don't care that I live 45 minutes away, and frankly, I don't care about the wait either!  MBB is worth every penny! So the place is really a hole in the wall, and it is noisy at full capacity. I haven't gotten out of a sit-down breakfast joint with even mediocre omelets and terrible coffee for less than $25.00 for two, but at MBB, we hit the jackpot! Here, I got a fluffy omelet with mushrooms (not from a can) and a mound of cheddar cheese, cooked perfectly (and I didn't even have to ask for it on the soft side), along with a heaping portion of the best tasting hash browns (fully cooked and not part raw)! And the sourdough toast . . . at least an inch thick, already buttered -- yes, buttered -- with homemade strawberry jam on the side. And, did I mention how great the coffee is, and within about four sips, they are there to give you a refill without having to wave them down?\n\nEveryone was so nice, from the nice young man who seated us, to the two (or three) waitresses that alternately handled our table (one took our order, two refilled our coffee, another took our bill). Service was top-notch! I can't think of any restaurant in our area of North Scottsdale that is even close to being this good! Especially for the price!\n\nWhen our waitress asked if she could get us anything else, I said, "another Matt's Big Breakfast . . . in North Scottsdale!"  I've already started coming up with a list of things we have to do in Phoenix so that we can go back to Matt's again!	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	qxmdrMmjTzgQhyHXKuyy3Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
WHBFO8Ne_kApEnRVPNb30g	4	2009-11-19 00:00:00	stopped in again last sunday before picking someone up at the airport. breakfast was flawless (again). i had the hog and chick this time and was very happy. hashbrowns were crispy, but not burnt. eggs were scrambled and fluffy. the jam of the day was strawberry, and some of the best i have ever had. love me some sourdough toast & jam. i waited less than 5 minutes ( it was only me), sat at the bar, and enjoyed swift, friendly service. coffee was fine but not great. if matt's is going to improve, i say the coffee is where to start.	4	2	4	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ByYHOTBYGKWK06lJoHzy_w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
wIOu6LOCj77z3RiIQAeiew	5	2012-09-29 00:00:00	The food at Matt's was delicious!  Went there on Thursday and got there around 10 and only waited 5 minutes.  I had the pork chop which comes with eggs, potatoes, and toast.  My son had the waffle with bacon. I also ordered a side of bacon so I could try it as we'll.  It was all delicious.  The food was very flavorful and well seasoned.  My son is 10 years old and is a picky eater.  He loved the waffle and ate almost his whole plate.\n\nI will definitely be back!	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	7v5rnZ0O8JdVqyZDlcUL8g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
wJI0pmTMky8aG4rzWT5KLA	3	2007-10-08 00:00:00	Matt's Big Breakfast? \n\nI'd say the only thing big about this place is the wait. When you walk up to the tiny place (it looks like a miniature brick block that you're not sure is big enough for humans), you scrawl your name down on a standard piece of notebook paper... and then you wait. Not fifteen minutes. Not twenty. More like 60. At least they have free water outside because, let's face, even in October, the Phoenix sun can be brutal.\n\nPeaking inside, you realize why there's such a wait: about 8 tables (most seat 2 or 4) and about 5 stools at the breakfast bar. It's no wonder... If you do the math, the average person takes about 30-45 minutes to eat breakfast. So, add the ordering time... the cooking time... the debit card time... And you have about an average of an hour per meal. The odds are against you.\n\nBut, you put your name down, so you might as well suck it up. It's going to be a BIG wait for Matt's Breakfast. So, it's no wonder the food gets such great reviews. You're ravenous by the time your name is called -- you'd eat the fake flowers if you could away with it. \n\nCoffee is meh. At least they bring ya real cream. That's awesome. \n\nThe decor is minimal. It's said the color orange makes one feel hungrier. I really don't think Matt needs to worry about his patrons being hungry by the time they sit down to eat. Again, the wait is BIG. \n\nBut, I'll stop whining about that. Moving on... \n\nI ordered the daily special - a scramble with mushrooms and fotini cheese. It came with home fries and two wedges of cinnamon raisin bread. It looked very good when it arrived. One bite of the scramble and I thought, "I could have made this." The home fries were bland... nothing like Kerby Lane's in Austin, Texas (if you've ever been, you know what I'm talking about... please, somebody wipe the drool from my face...). The redeeming piece was the bread. Granted, it's not the best bread I've had, but it was pretty yummy. I made sure to finish all that off, but I left 1/2 my scramble and all but a couple bites of my home fries behind. \n\nAs for the service, is was above average. Not extraordinary, like I somehow expected from a place like this that boasts the cozy feel of eating among friends. The service was prompt, though, and the people working were friendly and seemed to be in a chipper mood -- that's hard to imagine when you've been on your feet since before 6 a.m. with a consistent rush. One of the cute waitresses even made people outside laugh with, "We accept all kinds of payment. Cash. Credit. Check. Or you can work in the kitchen for a little bit." I thought her happy-go-lucky attitude was a breath of fresh air. \n\nIn conclusion... \n\nWalking away from the tiny place, I commented, "I'm pretty sure I won't be going back there." \n\nFrom all the great reviews I've read, I had to try this place. I'm glad I did... it was definitely an experience, especially since the police showed up to deal with some next door squabble/drug bust/whoknowswhat. At least while I was waiting, I had free entertainment to occupy my time.	9	6	5	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	KeuwC8E1238SP6xyKpBM6w	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
wLjNsQ9zkDcL6YYqC6Al5Q	4	2010-01-02 00:00:00	tasty pasty!  \n\nmy favorite part of my experience was the butter and the jam. DEEELISSHHHH. \n\ni could hardly make a dent in my pancakes but I couldn't just let that butter go to waste, so i put the rest of the butter on a piece of pancake and ate that. it would have been weird if i just ate the butter, but i would have. I got the rest to go and asked for extra butter to come along with it. I think the pancakes were amazing, but it could have just been that butter. \n\nI must have thought I hadn't eaten in years bc I also ordered the bacon which is the best bacon i've ever had. let's add that to my list of best part. bacon, strawberry jam, and butter. healthy eating at it's finest. \n\nI also had the homefries but they needed salt and didn't go well w the ketchup they are served with. \n\nI would go back and order strawberry jam toast,  mountain of butter, and 12 slices of bacon.	11	9	11	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	JmhVFueYvJe0CsUddwuajw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
wmhJNgby8FrZl_npS23N7A	1	2012-03-07 00:00:00	Waited 30 mins to find out the girl was skipping me on the waiting list. She said she wasn't skipping me, that there were places for two people to sit, but not one. The last time I checked, one person is able to sit where two people can sit. I don't give a pretty fuck that you are trying to turn more tables, if I am waiting 30 mins, when it's my turn, ITS MY TURN. If someone that came after me, sits before I do, you are skipping me. There is no arguing with me about it. Won't be back.	6	4	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	AKIaMyrysZwHeYSG4MCW8g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
wn2Kuxu6sIbwJn1aFBBzCw	1	2010-07-14 00:00:00	OMG, you must be kidding and this place is in business?? so i have heard of Big Matts and wanted to try it. This afternoon i went their for the first time and what a JOKE. first of all i arrived at 12:15 PM and the front door was locked. I asked couple of men that were standing outside how to you get in this place and they told me from the front door, which i was standing in front of. So i knocked on the door and the server opened the door. My first thought is to the owner, dont be cheap and just go ahead and get a real lock for the front door. Then I asked servers where the bathroom was? she told me they dont have one, however they share one with the hotel next door. (this is not a Hilton by the way). I asked i just want to wash my hands. She told me they had hand sanitizer up front. so i used it . I understand the place is small, however, there is health requirement and I am not sure how they pass this. I believe the employees would wash their hands more then once a day. CAUTION!!!! HEALTH. \n\nFood. the server was nice and took my order. I asked for their best item on the menu and she highly recommended the daily special. Okay that is what i will get. I got two scrambled eggs, fresh motezzerla, sausage (disgusting) and sweet peppers, this was served with home potato's and toast. how bad can the eggs be, the sausage was uneatable, the potato's were full of Rosemary, and ONE slice of toast for $ 8.95. I have been to numerous breakfast restaurant  and never remember being served ONE slice of toast. Please dont be cheap for $ 8.95 you can serve two slice of toast. \nI am not sure what the hype is about this place, i will never go there. if you want breakfast go somewhere else like "the breakfast club".	1	2	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	0hGfUINknhE2GWBWFnPxdA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
WNvS8vW9CYvG8WJSbsqVag	4	2012-08-24 00:00:00	Yes, you have to wait a long time to eat here... I came to Matt's on a Saturday with a friend and we waitedddddddd, but boy was it worth it. It could just be that I was just THAT hungry and anything I ate at that point was going to be amazing, but I'd like to think it was because the food wasn't some greasy no flavor mess you get at iHOP or god forbid...Denny's. They use fresh ingredients and they have REAL butter on their pancakes and waffles!!!! btw...the waffles are like....how do I put this?.... Waffle heaven! When they offer you the home fries or the hash browns, say home fries! and I only say that because I have not tasted the hash browns and I think the home fries are amazing! The home fries are potatoes made in buttery goodness, rosemary, and onions (not over-onion-baring at all). The freshly squeezed orange juice is tiny but it is sooo worth the $2.50 for those exquisite 6 sips! Staff was very attentive and friendly, the hostess was apologizing to everyone for the wait... and I think she really meant it :)	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	28DMLgQTM_cA5InromSovQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
Wpp4-hHJ44i80E1XdBEpgw	5	2010-07-07 00:00:00	This place is fantastic.\n\nAbout the restaurant itself.  It's right by downtown Phoenix, and in fact right next to a Light Rail stop--so keep this in mind, parking is metered and sometimes hard to come by easily, if you live by a light rail this may be the smarter option.  The place is seriously tiny, only about 6-8 groups of people can be seated at one time.  A slight drawback is that there is limited outdoor seating, which, given the predictably large lines even on weekdays, is a problem.  The Phoenix sun will make a 45 minute wait seem like an hour and a half wait.\n\nNow about the service.  I've always had a good experience with the people who work here.  The first time I came here, apparently one of the owners saw that I looked lost, because she came out and very kindly explained how people are seated, where I can go to get coffee in the meantime.  She even suggested I leave my cell phone number and she'll call me when my seat is ready, in case I'm shopping for example.  The waitresses always serve us quickly and never leave us hanging, and they're always smiling, which for some reason makes the experience so much better.\n\nNow for the best part.  I swear, they put crack in their food, because although their breakfast options are simple, they are out of this world.  The first time I came here I got the waffles.  Perhaps it's because they use REAL maple syrup, or all of the ingredients are organic and locally grown, but they make the best waffles I've ever had.  I don't even know how one makes a good waffle really, it seems pretty formulaic, but it's stellar.  I ordered it with bacon, which was also wonderful--the bacon used was the good stuff, not the excessively fatty bacon you buy at the supermarket.  Every bite is spectacular, and when you're done, you're full, but not the kind of full you'll often get at breakfast joints where you think you're going to explode or take a nap--full, but refreshed.\n\nThe second time I came I got the pancakes.  Not the best pancake I've ever had, but still, superb and the real maple syrup just sends it through the roof.  The third time I went I got the waffle again (see above).\n\nBefore I came here, I was excited about leaving Phoenix for New York due to the incredible array of dining options you get in that city.  Now I'm worried there won't be anything as good!	2	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	oOtEsKCNhMt0yF9L1Fkp9Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
WTYWPvSlVR9GGsGEsN0F9w	3	2012-03-13 00:00:00	So for being featured on DDD, I expected a little more than what I got to be honest.  We arrived on a Sunday morning at 8:15 and waited a half hour, which I was fully expecting from the other reviews.  I was underwhelmed by the limited menu but understand that it has to be that way to turn the tables as fast as they need to in order to accommodate the crowd waiting outside.  My omelet was alright and my husband got the salami scramble which he did enjoy.  The sourdough toast, homemade jam and fragrant squeezed OJ was what I enjoyed the most.  I would recommend to visitors but honestly don't know if I would continue to come here and wait as a regular.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	3GhjdIYjUr_QrDvi4CpWvg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
wu59m9ATjkMoJuj8TYcz7w	5	2009-09-19 00:00:00	My husband came to my work to have lunch with me the other day and being how all I hear about in this area is Matt's, I decided we would go try it. So we pulled up outside and found a parking spot, WOOHOO!! (there seemed to be limited spaces unless you want to meter it) I looked at the outside and was again scared of the size (I really do have claustrophobia) but decided I was going in! It was VERY small but we got a table in the "back room" which cracked me up because there is this really small step to get to it and all the workers' kept saying "watch your step", it was just really funny. \n\nSo, I had the cheese omelet and home potatoes with bacon. It was delicious! My husband had the salami and egg scramble with hash browns and LOVED it! This is our new favorite breakfast spot! The only bad thing was the restroom which has been mentioned in other reviews, it's next door at the motel which is not so desirable so go to the bathroom before you go to Matt's and everything should be fine. The service was excellent and I will definitely be back, oh and no wait! It must have been my lucky day!!	0	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	IHpF-9saLHzX1IRtLqOEgQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I appreciate their choice to use fresh, wholesome ingredients, and their food is delicious. Amazing hash browns, fresh juice, homemade preserves, great bread! Everything is tops. The only bummer is that it's always packed, but I don't hold that against them.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	ioaRtci1qvp-s0fO1ONjCA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
WUuYnQg0XsPTRwA1AdTLtw	4	2011-10-04 00:00:00	I'm sure you're asking how good can breakfast be? At Matt's it's the little things that count. Instead of giving you a piece of bread from a bag they give you a huge piece of fresh baked bread with real butter and homemade preserves. The organic eggs they use to make breakfast taste amazing and the syrup here puts Aunt Jemima to shame! Want to avoid the horrible wait everyone talks about? At Matt's the early bird gets the worm. Arrive between 6am-8am and you won't have to wait.	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	maK3UBQczh33NuDjBYeHrA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
wXE2UdSNb7OQP419YAdJDg	5	2008-07-05 00:00:00	This is such a cool little place, just about hidden in a little building in a crappy part of downtown Phoenix. It is one of those tiny little diners, with GREAT food. I am so happy one of my co-workers convinced me to try it out. Expect a wait if you go during peak hours. The simplicity of the menu, and the great food it worth the wait though.\n\nNot sure why some of you had such a bad experience... Maybe it's because you went in the summer, I would venture to say that any place that small and that busy would suck in the heat.	4	3	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	SWw6UreEI0KRej3lQ48uxQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

My girlfriend and I went suedo-hungry, the wait as we knew and expected was long and limited with seating, but totally worth it. Blythe time western sat, very hungry. We tore over the menu and order the Five Spot sandwich and the special. Both of us agreed we've never had a more delicious breakfast! Honestly was expecting a little letdown, but didn't.

The prices are high for the amount of Food.  Three pancakes were $8.00 and they were not big at all less than half the plate.  My dad had a bowl of oatmeal which cost $5.50.  I was not impressed the food was just average nothing to rave about.  Also there is no parking except on the street which has meters and no bathroom you have to go to the hotel next door which has a bathroom.  It is very cramped and hardly any room.  I was impressed they had organic milk on the menu but beside this the food was just average.  I suggest not to make a special trip unless you're a DDD person and want to experience it like most of the customers were when we were there.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	MAmijW4ooUzujkufYYLMeQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

When my friends took me for brunch to Matt's Big Breakfast, I'm questioning her option, but since we were near this place, I agreed to try this place out. I ordered The Chick and The Chop, they gave option of eggs and I choose my fav scramble eggs. Fries or hashbrown, I choose the fries. And last time to choose my bread. Whole wheat it is! My best option for breakfast drink is always OJ so I ordered one. The OJ came, freshly pure orange juice served in a small cute cup with chicken logos. It was superb! Although the cup is small and I swore I can chug the OJ in 3secs but it still worth it! The porkchop was excellent! My whole wheat bread was thick and tasty! My scrambled eggs and fries were perfect! And last but not least, the additional bacon that I ordered was great! The only complaint that I have for this place is just the service. My waitress was too busy talking with 2 college guys customer that over-flirt her so she forgot we already gave her our card and wait for almost 45 minutes just to finish the payment. Overall, I will definitely be back for my superb breakfast but hopefully I will get a fast service next time ;))	0	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	lC7eMQdOE8ZUKBs3J_2NYQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
XdlEMn_LXJ7aB-mk9zaiFw	5	2010-03-30 00:00:00	IT WAS AMAZING. My friends and I were on a road trip to the Grand Canyon and also visiting a friend in the area, so we decided to stop by this place. It was featured on Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-In's and Dives and definitely worth every minute of it! \n\nWe got their daily special - spicy chirizo sausages with eggs, jalapeños and with hash browns on the side. The food came out pretty quickly and it was just perfect. The fresh jalapeños added a slight kick but the spiciness did not overwhelm the taste of the sausages. The eggs that were scrambled in with the meat was perfectly light and fluffy. Their hashbrowns were fried with butter, so it tasted a bit different from your typical hashbrowns. I am not a huge fan of butter fried anything, so I didn't really care for it, but my friends all LOVED it.  One of my friends got the waffles with a strip of bacon, and the bacon was thick and crispy, cooked just right. Also, don't forget about the coffee! It's delicious - not too acidic like Starbucks, just the way I like it. \n\nThe decor in the restaurant is also very cute - bright yellow doors, retro looking posters on the walls, a small traditional diner like table sectioning off one of the corners. All of our servers were super friendly and made the entire experience a blast. If you are in the area, it's definitely a place you have to check out!!!	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	IuMgr92bN6LhLnqaAhBZ9Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

When I order hash browns I usually have to specify that I want them extra crispy otherwise I get a lump of anemic grated potato.  Not at Matt's.  They know what kind of hash browns this girl likes - a good crispy crust with a creamy almost mashed potato-like interior.  \n\nI also ordered the waffle and bacon.  The waffle was light and fluffy and very tasty with the real maple syrup.  The bacon was thick cut and had a delicious peppery exterior.  \n\nNow, if only I could get them to open one up in San Francisco.	2	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	BBTFyjdgWSEdzhQFEQx65g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

There are only two umbrellas for shade and this morning, there was no water in the jug.    \n\nThe service could not have been worse--everyone seemed slow and apathetic. \n\nWhen we were finally seated, we were placed on stools in the window where tourists were taking pictures of us eating/the inside.

xEQwQL4wdV1MAYSpXDIH_A	4	2008-08-13 00:00:00	I don't know what people expect from a "diner".  I took my parents there this week and both of them loved it.  This is not some "health food" place for the Birkenstock crowd.  This is traditional diner fare.  Greasy yes, and good.  My Father had the omelet with the hash browns and he loved it.  He even commented on how good the hashies were due to the fact they were slathered in butter/fat.  My mother had the pancakes and she loved them too.  They have corn meal in them which might not appeal to a "traditionalist", but they were very good nonetheless.  I had the Belgian waffle and it was very good too.  \n\nThe coffee was typical diner fare as well.  I would not call it drek as I am a coffee snob and roast green beans at home.  The coffee was what I expected from a diner.  We went at 8AM on a Tuesday and walked right in.  The staff was friendly and prompt.  \n\nI would go again with no problem.	1	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	8YrD0_wpzpqRctpyPn8BMg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
xHIUCOiXfrg4KKXsEYWBng	4	2006-12-08 00:00:00	The service sucks at Matt's. Unfortunately for those of us that like good food AND good service the food is crave worthy- better than any breakfast I have ever had, so simple and so, so, yummy. That being said, I have never been to a restaurant that ran out of cream for coffee. Not only that but they made it seem like no big deal, no apologies. I had one too many bad experiences and have not been back since. I have been tempted many a time to go back and see if they have changed their evil ways, but I just can't bring myself to do it. We'll see- life is too short to hold grudges, especially when good food is involved, right?\n\nUPDATE: Ok, we ventured back to Matt's to celebrate my birthday in April and I have to say that the service wasn't bad at all.... no more snotty waitresses, so I am adding 2 more stars. If they would make the effort to be really friendly they would get my 5th star... but I won't hold my breath, I think it is just not that kind of place. Now if you really are a thrill seeker I have a challenge for you... go to the bathroom at Matt's (go ahead and ask them where the bathroom is and you will see what I mean)... and if you want to have a good laugh imagine a nine months pregnant woman trying to go to the bathroom at Matt's... yeah, that was fun, luckily I escaped with little more than a pinch on the thigh from the toilet seat... but unless you have a death wish you should definitely empty your bladder BEFORE you go to Matt's...fair warning.	0	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	L2iDmzopbONuJZeO2SBKAg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Other than the wait (which was expected) the food was delicious. Everyone working at Matt's were friendly (they all say goodbye to you as you leave). I definently recommend getting the bacon as a side if it does not come as part of your meal. If you can't stand the heat, order carryout or show up later (at 11:30 there was maybe a 15 minute wait).	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	BcovypoLnNk7LGsnBEN9_A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

XnKB0j5a3XZuNb_t_VNHuA	5	2007-09-30 00:00:00	The best way to describe Matt's is "breakfast nirvana."  I've been going to this cheery downtown spot for weekend breakfasts and weekday lunches for around 2 years now and have never been disappointed with the food.  Small touches of quality abound: freshly-ground pork sausage patties, perfectly browned, homestyle potatoes o'brien (not of that cubed pre-frozen crap), thick-cut bread with homemade jam, and what tastes like real maple syrup for Matt's awesome pancakes.\n\nWhat keeps a breakfast enthusiast like me from hitting Matt's at each opportunity are the insane queues, especially on weekends.  The air conditioning can also be a bit sketchy at times, too, given the cramped space and swarm of humanity in there at busy times.	1	0	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	WuRG6goc7Fy-c4JADVZesQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

XNUbbNCbjTama9HkhdGB2Q	5	2008-02-19 00:00:00	Oh how I love a good breakfast!\n\n     My first experience at this quaint little establishment was this past weekend, my sister, her boyfriend....my girlfriend and I decided we needed a bite to eat after a looong night of celebrating....they chose to make the trek from Gilbert to our side of town...our first logical choice laying in bed with a swelling head you ask?  Of course we had to try Matt's...after all, we had been hearing for weeks about the bountiful breakfast that awaited....\n\n     I absolutely love something about a place that can make you feel as though your a tourist in your own town...and this one does it, very small inside....no waiting area except the side walk in front....you have to "sign in" on an ordering pad (cute touch in my opinion)...any how, after seeing what we were up against....I thought the worst, you know what I'm talking about....long wait!  Thankfully I was wrong, we were sat within about 10 minutes!  (Side note, I think we were a bit lucky on timing....as we left, there were a LOT more people waiting, I believe we got there around 9-9:30)\n\n     Ok....for breakfast we all tried about the same thing....."The Hog and Chick"....fancy(kind of ;) way of saying eggs and some kind of swine....anyhow, all the basics are included here...potatoes (your choice, home fries or hash brown)  I chose home fries...and let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised...with out a doubt the best I'd ever had!  Along with the potatoes there were onions and fresh rosemary....honestly the rosemary made them.  The eggs were cooked wonderfully....over easy seems like an easy fix...but its truly amazing how many times this can be a disaster.  My best friend had the ham....and let me tell ya...Nicki loves some good ham...and she got it!  \n\n     I have read some other reviews of this place....some talking of prices too steep....not sure where they were coming from, but all four of us....huge plates, soft drinks and or milk....with tip about 45 dollars...not sure I would classify that as "over the top"....not for a meal of this magnitude...maybe Denny's...but hey if you want that...you know where to go ;)\n\n     Only quark with our truly wonderful experience you ask?....we got the wrong drinks....regular instead of diet....other than that, the wait staff was cheery and funny...two things that are a must with me when I'm baby sitting a hang over.\n\nLike I said...I love a good breakfast...Matt's truly delivers!\n\nThanks Matt....I will be back, very soon!	3	0	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	TMQkt9KvjRYsP3GhcS2opA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
Xo4SuOjgYLB50_maP0AYfQ	4	2012-04-03 00:00:00	Wife took me to breakfast this morning. My daughter told us to try this place. So here we are at around 8:30 AM and the place is busy. Had to wait about 10 minutes for a table...beats waiting an hour on the weekends. If your a twosome, you have a faster chance of getting a table.\nI had their Salami Scramble with hash browns and sour dough. My wife had the Hog & Chick with home fries and sour dough. \nThe last time I had soppresata salami was when I was a kid. The dish was great as long as you're a salami lover. It just brought back great memories as a teenager in North Beach in San Francisco eating a salami sandwich on a hard roll for lunch. \nThe hash browns were a little over cooked, but hey, they were hash browns.\nOne other thing, the sour dough was actually sliced from a loaf of sour dough bread which came with homemade jam.\nWe will return.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	vwi68eg4bmJHMSYq3jP2OQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I'm not sure what the secret ingredient is but they are beyond good! Fluffy little cakes of love. I also tasted the butter burger. Very, very, yummy. If you decide to dine here make sure you try the bacon. I don't think I've ever tasted anything like it. Sweet, savory and cooked just right.\n\nThe building is very small, the wait is extra long and make sure you don't overindulge on the free refills of ice tea because there is NO BATHROOM!! The seating is cramped and the service is rushed, but the food is worth dealing with Matt's shortcomings.	1	0	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	s5mUnu5y58F0CndRO9NHwA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
XxdB71Fm2o3jNjHC2v9yjA	3	2010-01-05 00:00:00	Matt's Big Breakfast is pretty yummy. I would have to agree though that a big fuss is made over this place. I have had the pancakes twice and both times they seemed dry. I think the biggest problem I have had is having a "big breakfast" and not enough to wash down my pancake the size of a UFO with. The juice is understandably "freshly squeezed" but a glass the size of a shot glass for almost 3 bucks is ridiculous. Personally I'm not one to enjoy water with a meal, which is probably your best choice so you don't end up spending your life savings on shots of OJ. They do have sodas but in a can and that's if you are an RC fan. The funny thing is I tried once to bring in a drink to help with the aid in digestion of my breakfast and they have a sign on the front door that reads "No outside beverage".

xxlNT2auRQta1kf280f-4Q	5	2009-08-19 00:00:00	I went to Matt's the other morning for a solo breakfast before work. I was treating myself because I'd been on a gluten-free diet for over a month and that was the day I was reintroducing wheat after getting some blood drawn, and I'd been literally dreaming about waffles for weeks. \n\nDiet aside, it was such a nice, cheerful way to start my day. I'd been to Matt's before for a Sunday brunch, and we waited forever outside in the heat. This was totally different: I walked in and sat down at the counter, no wait at all, and the waitstaff is very attentive and quick. I found myself smiling out at downtown Phoenix through that big picture window before my beloved waffles had even graced my place setting. \n\nWaffles: solid. Belgian.\nBacon: thick-cut and peppered. I could have eaten 5 more slices.\nHomefries: this is what I remember as being so stand-out from my first visit, and they did not disappoint the second time. Crispy, tasty potato chunks with caramelized onions and sauteed bits of rosemary...oh yum. And they're not even made of wheat.\n\nThanks, Matt, for giving me a lovely mid-week breakfast experience.	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	4VmuXuSRhv5UxYUy3tMpiQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
Xy8pZ8CneV8JbroTY26Nlw	5	2010-04-08 00:00:00	One of the best parts of my career is that I get to eat around. If eating were sex, I'd safely call myself a whore.\n\nMatt's Big Breakfast isn't just my favorite breakfast in Phoenix. It's quite possibly my favorite breakfast anywhere. Matt and Ernie do it right, and Phoenix is one lucky town for it.\n\nWhen I work in Phoenix, I conveniently stay just  few blocks away. On my last visit, I made it into Matt's no fewer than four out of the six days I was there.\n\nYes, you will likely wait outside if you go on the weekend. Not so much on a Tuesday, but perhaps. You never know. It's not important, though. It's so worth the wait. (weight).\n\nHaving tried a good portion of the menu, I keep coming back to the "Salami Scramble". It's one of those things you may make in your own kitchen and eat too much of when no one is looking. It's exactly what you imagine it is and, when paired with their amazing hash browns, close to perfection.  If you're feeling hungry enough, the Chop and Chick is the way to go. A delicious, well chosen pork chop with eggs. Sigh.\n\nThe quality of the food at Matt's is memorable for its flavor, temperature and love which is clearly sprinkled generously on top of every buttery bite. \n\nBig Breakfast. Big Love. Big Belly.	3	3	5	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	PTEApjO1rbF30le3PGVGrw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

We meet on location and as I pull up, my friend is sitting outside and signals me to park around the back. The back parking lot was full, so I parked on 1 street, having to feed the meter. As I walk up I notice people outside waiting, so I sit on the bench next to my buddy out front for about three minutes when one of the girls calls us, we're next. The place is small and the atmosphere is loud because of the small space, but hey, this is downtown phoenix, who cares. I ordered the triple stack pancakes with a side of sunny side up eggs and a order of bacon. My buddy ordered the Pork Chop breakfast with potatoes. The food was great, all home made. The only thing that bothered me was there was no reg sugar, just brown. Next time I will have to bring my own sweet and low for the coffee. Girls are cute, service was great.

Y4gBUBfmWGxDZidtofOZjw	4	2009-10-10 00:00:00	My final meal in Phoenix, which was breakfast. This small brick place has made me famous with the name (of course) and was honored with a "Review of the day", which seems like a distant-memory ago. My first visit and first meal back then was a monumental one. Will my return to "my" breakfast place be a repeat? \n\nSome things hasn't changed much about my place. There was a little wait for a table, especially on a early weekday morning. "My place...why should I have to wait for a table?"\n\nThis time, my return back has got me ordering one of the breakfast specials, which was the Salami Scramble. For $5.95 and affordable meal too, I get three scrambled eggs mixed with Soppresata Salami with a side of Hash Browns and a pair of thick toasted Sourdough Bread with Strawberry Preserves. The crispiness of the sliced salami blended with the scramble eggs made it a tasty combination. The hash browns were tasty and a nice compliment to my meal. And the thick-ass toasted Sourbread bread with melted butter and the preserves was crunchy with a powerful explosion that can be heard all over the small diner (in a good way).\n\nMy place hasn't failed in my return. I'm always welcome to come back and dine at my breakfast place whenever I come back to Phoenix. And so, you can too.	5	4	7	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	HYQoxBC1y1DGPq6pGP09Tw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I am so glad I went!\n\nService was friendly and lightning fast!  I went with the recommendation of the server, and got the special: 3 Eggs Scrambled with Wisconsin Cheddar, Chipotle Sausage, and fresh jalapenos.  So simple and so fricken good! OMFG!  The fresh jalapenos were so spicy and yummy!  It also came with hash browns.  I know this is a simple thing, but, seriously, I've never had better hash browns in my life. I also had to order a side of bacon and am so glad I did. YUM!  Good coffee to go with all this too.  \n\n\nLater in the day, the hubby got out of his meeting early so we went to grab lunch there!!!  He loved the Reuben: its flavor, quality and quantity of meat, etc.  Had more hash browns and bacon =)  and tried the waffle. Tasty!\n\nI would go here every week if I lived here. Matt's really has a commitment to local, fresh ingredients and it shows in the food and how buy this place can get!

Y6YIaJoY2ak43b31mduccg	5	2010-07-27 00:00:00	Best breakfast in town that I have had the pleasure to sample in Phoenix\nYou will likely have to wait a while to get in, and seating is limited.  If you take a big party, you should be ready to wait a bit longer.  The food is always done great, and they have a daily special.  The ingredients are part of the success, and they use local fresh organic ingredients in the food.  The waffle is the best on that I have ever had in my life.  The eggs and ham or bacon are mucho terrific.  My cousin is a fan of he chop and eggs, and that its two healthy pork chops with eggs and sides.  I have eaten most of the stuff on the menu, and there is only one clunker in my book.  that is the home made potato chips with lunch items.  They are a little heavy for my taste, and its would be nice to see fries with stuff like a huge butter burger.  Sample the organic lemonade, and you won't be disappointed.  The restaurant is close to the light rail, so you could go there on that, and parking is limited.  Visit Matt's BB and you will be back without a doubt.  This is the kind of place that is more old school, and if you want a lot of space and don't want to be close to your fellow diners, you might not like the dining experience.  I see more of these kinds of places popping up now in Phoenix, and it is a great trend in having a more varied palette in the dining experience beyond the huge chains that seem to dominate such new cities like Phoenix.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	bDusg9_kLgEyLzahwrR1WQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

They'd be forced to mass cook, quality would go down and service would suffer.  True, this place COULD be a tad bigger, but you can't discount them for being delicious and popular.\n\nThe time my wife and I went, there was only a 20 minute wait, so we strolled around downtown Phoenix, visited the local organic grocer, which I highly recommend, and the time flew by.\n\nWe sat at the bar and got the inside scoop on the place as we chatted to everyone from the busboy to the owner.  And the scoop was, they are opening a high-end organic coffee shop on 5th and McDowell or Thomas,	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	cxfQr71C1rIi-cH_Ml8h-g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

The staff is friendly and doesn't seem stressed about getting people in and out, and once you're seated and order your food, it comes out super quick. And it is fantastic. Hashbrowns have never been so glorious. Thank you Matt's, for a delicious place to start the day.	1	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Cmxz02khzqJ5bWoks9kYLg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
yB9Vr-EHqD5L4eeTPpCBQA	5	2010-12-04 00:00:00	Well this was a pleasant surprise.  This place is small, a little cramped, but the food definitely makes up for it.  \n\nWhen seated, the waitress was very attentive and coffee was served almost immediately. The menu is small, but full of all the basics, along with the special of the day. \n\nMy fiance ordered the special, while I ordered the salami scramble. They are served with toast (white, wheat, sourdough, or cinnamon raisin) and potatoes (hash browns or country fried potatoes). We ordered the wheat, which was served with a chunk of butter melting between the slices and a small cup of jelly. The toast was served almost immediately after taking our order and it was full of nom noms. The service is fast and you never have to wait for a waitress to come by. There is always someone nearby to help. \n\nThe prices were very good as well. The average cost of entrees is between $4-8 dollars and the coffee has free refills. The amount of food served is just enough to fill you up with out making you feel like a glutton.\nThey don't take reservations and the place is very small with limited seating so either arrive early in the morning or expect to wait a while.	0	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	N4QYc-GnE0RWbXqKna_tug	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

It's adorable and close to home. \n\nI don't eat pork, which eliminated a good portion of the menu right off the bat. That's fine, it's not like I expect restaurants to cater to me, that's what my kitchen is for. \n\nI had the cheese omelet. It was good, but could have used some spices. The hash browns were ok, despite the fact that they were floating in their own grease. \n\nMatt's is great if you like breakfast with a bucket of grease on the side. It made me sick, so I won't be back.	4	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	CYermXzVz9xmpwDM26vS2A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

We wanted to dine in, but on our way to the airport it only made sense to bring the food back to the place we were staying at since we had yet to pack. This place brings the traditional simplicity of breakfast back to the kitchen table.\n\nWe opted for the "Hog & Chick" and Griddlecakes. Both were delicious and very filling. Simple breakfast made with that home made touch. We were glad we stopped by here before we headed back home. On top of the food, the service was amazing and friendly, and the bill was not a big dent in the wallet either. Overall an amazing experience with Matt's. We will definitely be back for our next trip.	0	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	SAqyye4BwTizzXcWnDvrwQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I think it would be worth it though! This is the BEST breakfast place. Their menu is very small and they do have some "lunch" items but I will never stray from their awesome omelets! The home fries and hash browns are both delicious, and they always have a special that's super yummy.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	jMTeTekgA9pKTZYov6Nq5A	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

It was a definite whole in the wall feeling, and I'm assuming you should be prepared to wait should you go at peak hours. We went on a Friday morning and had around a 20 minute wait. The food was so fresh and the pancakes were absolutely delicious. They really up the ante on diner fare and go fresh and local. The difference is in the taste. Even the sourdough toast was homemade. Well done...and at a great price.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	Q3JbjGLS18tVT7ekmWnlMA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

You just can't go wrong with eggs*, bacon*, home fries* (get the home fries, not the hashbrowns) and their toast* served with Terra Verde Farms preserves.  * = best ever, ever, ever\n\nI could write on and on...you've seen the reviews.

yNfKE6TEkC68XE0o-pV8SA	4	2010-06-14 00:00:00	I usually steer-clear of places that are rumored to have a long ass wait but my Mama selected this place for her birthday brunch, needless to say it was a yummy breakfast. We got there around 815 and were seated around 9, so if youre being leisurely, its worth the wait.\n\nThe menu is small and concise, making it somewhat easy to decide; it all looks and sounds so good. But it's all pretty basic meals with a couple of daily specials. One of which I had; scrambled eggs, jalapenos, cheese, onions, and a shit ton of delicious, partnered with home-fries and a tortilla. The jalapenos were just right and so fresh! We also had tried some of the walnut, raisin bread toast; which was fantastic. My boyfriend had the waffle which was good but I could tell he could use another one ($8 for one waffle?). I don't eat swine too often but the bacon was heavenly; thick and peppered. One thing I do regret about the meal was I saw someone order some chocolate milk, definitely should've got some instead of coffee; what's the rush to wake up on a Sunday anyway?\n\nWhen we came out, some people who had been waiting near us, were asking what we got and how it was. It seemed our leaving Matt's got everyone outside's mounths watering. Everyone lit up to hear our reviews, which I thought was pretty funny...So all-in-all it was good but nothing so amazing (which is what I've heard about this place). Great for a special occasion or once in awhile.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	P7itaCNtkxyX4E2i8qyn8g	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Everything I've had here is amazing and worth the wait as everyone else said. \n\nThe ingredients are local, the staff is friendly and the setting compact. Not a place I would try to to bring a group larger than 4 to though so if you have a large group, pick out the 3 others you like the most and ditch the rest! ;)	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	JS-v0cz1JB8ebMvi0y5IXg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
yoelbRVec11n_F24OxvDpw	1	2010-04-13 00:00:00	I feel like a douche bag for giving Matt's only 1 stars when everyone else raves about this place and the owner truly is such a delight so in my defense let me explain:\nThis place is a hot spot, every time I've tried to go there, it's packed.  Each time, I've never wanted to wait so I went on my way.\nOne Sunday, I was just down the street from them at Valley Youth Theatre watching Winnie the Pooh with my son and I thought how great it would be to take my son to this popular joint for a bit of breakfast afterward.  When we got out of the theatre, it was pouring rain in giant buckets, one of those rarities in Phoenix where you can't see what's in front of you cause it's raining so hard.  Well, we braved the rain and drove to Matt's~ 5 mins. after their posted closing time and yup, you guess it~ despite me and my 3 1/2 year old son drenched wet and  looking pleadingly at them for some warm food and a place to stay for awhile to get out of the rain, they told us they were closed and sent us on our way.  Talk about tough standards~ I guess when you are as popular as Matt's you get to make and stick by the rules you make.\nDespite that experience, I still wanted to try Matt's because of all the applaudes I've heard about the place. Finally I made it there on one of those days when I had the time for the long wait and sadly for me, I was sorely disappointed by the breakfast served to me.\nI had remembered reading some article about the BIG BREAKFAST served at Matt's and that's what I was expecting.  I ordered the waffle with bacon for $9 expecting a Denny's portion of food but with flavor and excellence.  The place was packed so I had to wait 30mins for my waffle to materialize in front of me.  When I got the one piece of waffle and one piece of bacon served to me, I thought perhaps while waiting I had accidentally swallowed Alice (in Wonderland) tonic and was now a giant looking at my rather small serving of food on my plate.  Seriously, I almost felt tears come into my eyes, I was so disappointed.  Needless to say, after trying so many times to go to Matt's and finally getting there just to have not a big breakfast but a are you kidding me?  where's the rest of my food experience, I will not go back there.  It's a good thing too cause it's far from my house and I hate waiting!	7	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	9uE0smG2bwgkI95RPj0lPQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
yP7jIVgEY7z9gIrZuW3YMA	5	2012-02-27 00:00:00	The best hamburger in Phoenix is Matt's BIG BUTTER BURGER, bar none.  Get it cooked medium and get the HASH BROWNS on the side, we like them crispy or well-done.  The meat is so tender and flavorful, it melts in your mouth, and the bun is specially prepared just for them.  Super fresh produce on the burger along with a big ole slab of American cheese makes this a burger you'll dream about later on.\nThe Griddle Cakes are our second-favorite item and when we go, we share a Burger and one order of the Cakes and we are both FULL and satisfied.  \nMatt's is truly a hole-in-the-wall, but don't let that deter you.  Figure out when the lines are short and GO, you won't regret it.\nWE LOVE THIS PLACE.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	OEQ93r1g0mUAmsDgsx6uDA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

YvZ73KIePVCSU44nPygZhw	5	2010-03-31 00:00:00	During one of our Spring Training trips, we stopped by here for breakfast on Guy Fieri's recommendation on Diners, Driveins and Dives. The place gets packed and it's a small little area, so expect to wait at least an hour. We waited for 90 minutes before we got in on a Sat morning...\n\nWell worth the wait! Ben had their omelet scrabble special with spinach, cheese and sausage. I had a simple scrabble eggs with sausage. Obviously, I liked Ben's dish WAY better. We ordered a side of their peppered bacon, they were thick and juicy and DELICIOUS! Ben was in love with their home fries, the hint of rosemary really added to the favor. Their pancakes and french toast looked good too, but we were too stuffed to try it.\n\nWe are going back on our next Spring Training trip! Definitely a must try, but like everyone said, be prepared to wait a LONG time.	1	1	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	3uHtK34U8eP1m9if8nNeiw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I ordered the wrong thing for sure.    the server recommended the hashbrowns, but my husband said home fries (of course via text, after I had ordered).   the hashbrowns were DROWNED in butter.   Not a bad thing but a heart attack waiting to happen, for real.   service was great, they churned and burned us and got us in and out.   But not sure what the hype is about.  its close, but not cheap as far as diners go, so in my mind I think i would have rather just eaten at home.  \nso 3 stars, for locally grown food, good service, and a little pricey.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	t70UiBYj5rQB7nXzbTWTaw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

zBGNHuh2TV_IR4cgt6pU6g	4	2011-01-06 00:00:00	So we waited for a table for an hour. in the winter. and it was windy. my hair was flying, my fingers were freezing and I was getting increasingly annoyed. why cant they expand their space just a little bit? The waitress kept running outside to check people off their list, and started handing out menus so that we could order. It took the joy of of looking at the menu and deciding what to eat. I was looking forward to a nice leisurely brunch after which we planned to go to the museum.  We would have left, except that this was downtown Phoenix and dint want to lose our parking spot. \n\nFinally, after a little more than an hour, we were seated. the place is TINY. Tables are close together and just as luck would have it, we got a table right next to the door, where every time she opened it, i was greeted with nice gush of COLD air. And people waiting outside could see us sit in the warmth and eat.\n\nThat being said, the food was excellent. I can't seem to remember names of our dishes, but the eggs were very good, with potatoes, toasted sourdough bread, orange juice and coffee.\n\nBut was the wait really worth it? I don't know! I don't think I'd want to wait for so long for a table. I'd recommend this place to friends for sure though. I think I just contradicted myself! don't get me wrong - excellent food. just that the waiting pissed me off. a lot.	2	1	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	vR3YbEgu8ALlirJhy5jMNA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
zDTVfEWpmd519rFBxTIY8A	5	2010-04-16 00:00:00	I'm not quite sure anyone could do breakfast any better. \n\nWe came on a Tuesday at about 9am, after previous attempts, and were seated right away. It is definately small and there is no place to wait inside, just multiple benches outside to bask in the blaring sun. If this is the case, bring sunscreen.\n\nThere is a pad of paper, just outside the door, to write your name and total number in party down -- that is known as the wait list.\n\nDon't even try to go on a weekend, atleast in my experience.\n\nAnyway, we both ordered the "hog and chick" - it was fabulous. Although they could have cooked the eggs a bit more. The bacon was thick cut and peppered, the has browns were real potatos, the toast was also really thick cut with real butter and local preserves.\n\nThe wait staff do not hover, the owner goes around making sure everyone is doing well. It's very heart warming being here.	4	0	3	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	b1NOAQSKdOT3susb5XcMtA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

In order to not waste your time, I'll keep it short and simple.\n\n - Best pancakes I've ever had.\n - Bacon was quite delicious.\n - Spectacular, thick cuts of bread for the toast.\n - Yummy, homemade jam.\n - Quick and friendly service.\n - Don't forget to ask for your to-go cup of coffee.\n\nI went on a Friday morning, and we only waited 5 minutes for a table of four.  Like "they" say, this place is small so it's going to fill up quick on the weekends.  Not sure about you, but I instantly think, "What can I do to avoid the wait?"\n\nHere's my tip . . . find a reason to go out to breakfast on a weekday.  Plan a "business breakfast" with some co-workers (we do "business lunch" all the time . . . why not breakfast?).  Or pick a day when you can go in an hour or two late and have a friend meet you.  Make it a birthday breakfast for your signification other, parent, or sibling.  Whatever the reason . . . just find one!  It's a nice way to mix up the regular weekly routine with something fun and treat yourself at the same time.  \n\nAnd trust me, Matt's is worth it!	3	2	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	4DaYRzOMGcn2zoWkHLNBjA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
zhpNZdhm-pnaV-wRBAsCeQ	1	2013-10-31 00:00:00	My visit was a complete disappoinment.  I drove all the way from Scottsdale because I had heard such good things about Matt's, so I arrived hungry, and with high expectations.  \n\nThe restaurant was busy, with only counter seating available, so I took one of the available stools.  They are VERY uncomfortable metal stools.  The seats are round, unupolstered, metal, smaller than most folks butts (I am a small woman), insufficiently contoured, and very slippery. I had to pull the stool in close to the counter, wedge my knees against the counter, and keep my feet on the rungs of the stool in order not to feel as if I would slide off.  The hard metal seat was so uncomfortable that I kept looking around in to see if a table opened up.\n\nSo, uncomfortably perched, I decided to try the pork chop, eggs, hashbrowns and wheat toast.  The plated food looked good.  The eggs were fine and cooked as ordered but even after trying all 3 of the salt shakers on the counter, I couldn't get enought salt without opening the shaker, and though I am not a heavy salter, everything needed salt.  The pork chop looked appealing but turned out to be dry, overcooked, difficult to cut even with the steak knife that was provided, and tasteless (seriously),   I could see that the meat was seasoned, but I couldn't tast whatever they used.  I didn't understand the texture of the hash browns.  The top and bottom were crisp and pretty good, but the middle (which comprised most of the order) was really wet.\n\nHungry as I was, I ate some of the crispy part of the hash browns, a little of the pork chop, a couple bites of toast, and only one of the eggs because nothing appetizing remained to eat with the second one (I can't handle eggs alone).  No big breakfast at Matt's for me.  I was too disappointed to even complain about my meal.  I just paid my check and left for the treck back to Scottsdale with no plan to ever return to Matt's.	5	0	1	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	1BcNXW9_Y16TIofPVpFqIA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
zhts9__59gxkh4D5rbKI-Q	4	2013-01-16 00:00:00	The bacon served here is something special.  However, this place not only has big breakfasts it also has big waits.  The waits are to be expected with such an establishment, but once you reach your seat... well it is not a comfortable one.  The seating is too hard and the set-up does not support a leisurely weekend breakfast with friends...  a yummy breakfast... yes... but not a leisurely one.  Nevertheless, give it a try and enjoy the bacon.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	R4hfiD7f4T2XE8ih5UM0JQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Loved the cranberry walnut bread. Coffee was good. Had the 3 egg, mozzarella, spinach special which was good. Nicely made home fries & hash.

zix1KypsOXRLvBPXUbIVxw	4	2008-11-26 00:00:00	Today happens to be the first day of my Thanksgiving break, so I figured I should hit up a breakfast or lunch place that I wouldn't normally get to go to.  I read up on some of the reviews here and felt a bit unsure, as there are lots of negative ones but decided that I trust David SB, Mr. K and Pierre much more than all the naysayers.  I'm glad I did.\n\nI also, for some unexplainable reason, did not think there would be such a long wait on a random Wednesday morning.  I mean, don't people have jobs?  We ended up waiting about a half hour, which wouldn't have been bad but it also happens to be one of five days that it rains in Phoenix.  The wait was long, and both Nathan S. and I were getting close to regretting our decision.  There was great people watching though- a man running into The Coronado Hotel (that boasts an RCA electronic system and refrigeration) with a case of Natty Light, many people rushing out of Matt's to save their car from the meter police and just generally, the meter police vehicle.\n\nWe were seating and immediately served coffee which I don't usually drink.  Nathan S. assured me that this is not the kind of place with french vanilla creamer, which is sad for me, but overall a good thing and compliment to Matt's taste.\n\nI ordered the griddle cakes and a side of hash browns.  Our food arrived at different times which wasn't cool but I figure that kitchen is tiny.  It didn't take too long for his to arrive, so we just had to wait a few minutes to dig in.\n\nOne word- BUTTERTASTIC!  I am not a breakfast girl, and I attempt to eat healthy (mostly to offset the booze intake) but this was amazing.  I knew it was a very naughty breakfast, but delicious all the same.  Nathan S. also commented that the mushrooms in his omelet had definitely been marinated in butter prior to being put into the omelet, which made me like this place more.\n\nIf you are into naughty breakfasts, Matt's is your kind of place.	10	5	8	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	5uiCy0vSIknuDEHc7yHRkw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
ZJgZLTKyhrz8vNL3ix832g	5	2010-05-11 00:00:00	Amazing! Such a fun little restaurant. It adds character to downtown Phoenix and the food is great! I got the hot cakes, which were huge and tasted so free, with real butter and real maple syrup. The service was friendly and the atmosphere made me feel like I was back in time at a cute little dinner but with a modern twist. My friend had the special, which was eggs benedict and hashbrowns. Also amazing and you can tell all the ingredients are farm fresh. I'm salvating just thinking about it! The wait wasn't too bad for us. We got their right around 9am and waited for 20 minutes, ate in 40 minutes. However there was quite the line of people after us. I don't suggest going in a large group and only go if you have time for a relaxing morning, long wait but they feed you quickly- but not rushed!	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	IVoYeldw-SxTpoaYjfzj7Q	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
zKnoS2lW6NMngf07Y5qrTw	4	2012-07-08 00:00:00	So my hubby and I found ourselves in this area and the first place on my yelp search is this one... and we may had not paid much attention to it, but it sounded like a place a friend had just mentioned a few days back so we decided to try it...\nYou know those little things that set a place apart from the others? this one is full of those! the tap water tastes good, the glasses are quaint and beautiful. The home potatoes had tasty herbs, I ordered eggs and pork chop and the pork chop seemed to have something like pesto. The Wheat bread was better than I ever had, and instead of jelly, real blueberries... I could go on and on. Yes, the place is tiny, and perhaps a little pricey, but I think it is worth it. Service was great too. And since we were there at the right time, we didn't have to wait to be seated, neither had trouble parking. Good luck and enjoy.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	z_tqPytGQF_tDw_buHKJcw	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

Add two dollars to the price of everything.  Also the portions seemed to have shrunk a bit from whenever pictures here were taken.\n-There is only one 4-top, everything else is 2-top or counter, so plan accordingly.  We got there early and put our name on the list despite the agonizing taunt of all those empty 2-tops.  The bf was a little grumpy the waitress didn't put 2 tables together, but admitted there really wasn't room to do that without blocking a path.\n-The decor is cute and Ikea-esque.  Very clean and bright, I felt like I was in a Real Simple spread.\n-The blueberry jam tastes like normal blueberry jam.  It's cute and nice to get in a cup instead of a package, but otherwise not special.\n-I ordered bacon because everyone said the bacon was amazing, even though the sausage looked really good.  My bacon was thick-cut but burned and not particularly tasty regardless of doneness.\n-They cooked my eggs over medium!  I always ask and usually get over easy anyway.  I appreciate the effort, maybe he was concentrating and accidentally burned my bacon.\n-The home fries have a LOT of rosemary, so don't get it if you're not a big fan.  It perfumed the whole plate and the leaves soaked in the oil seeped into everything.  I liked it.\n-Don't come here if you want a quiet, private breakfast experience.  The guy sitting behind us seemed grouchy as soon as he was seated and spent the meal glaring at my in-laws, presumably for speaking loudly over the restaurant noise (like everyone else).  He made a lot of pointed throat-clearing and loud newspaper rustling that seemed to embarrass the crap out of his wife and perplex patrons around us.  I really don't know what we did, but don't be this guy.	0	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	7hKi9AzTRUa94mMm_miVww	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

ZOf--AfPuHd3HLOxgnGnpw	4	2010-04-16 00:00:00	The aptly named Big Breakfast isn't the only thing they should be famous for. The food is not only generous, its fresh. The potatoes are home made (nothing processed here) and the bread appears as if its never seen a bag in its life. \n\nThey kept the coffee coming! \n\nWe didn't wait at ALL on Tuesday at 7AM so if you work downtown, do yourself a favor and hit Matt's before work one day..you'll beat the traffic, the Saturday lines and be so full, you probably won't need much of a lunch. \n\nIn short: fresh food, tall coffee, tasty treat. Well worth it. Even with a wait.	4	1	2	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	f71r-LEp9O8yJu76XhPadQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
zqVETYbamNBECMN5La1vFA	4	2011-05-28 00:00:00	Coming from a diner-centric middle america, I was a little underwhelmed at the limited menu at Matt's, but boy, what he does cook he does excellently. The scrambled eggs I had in my special were easy enough, and I liked the combination of the local shishito peppers, ham, and jack cheese, but the hashbrowns are a shining example of how to execute them perfectly. I wish I had the bacon, too, because that also looked outstanding. Like many of the best places in Phoenix the line grows exponentially by the hour, so get there early and prepare to wait. It's interesting to see the large amount of abandoned restaurant concepts in the surrounding area, but I don't expect Matt's will be among them anytime soon.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	rlDDkE6G-nMO-z0hNqekzA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

zXI_YcTEXqoQe35t2Kd9gQ	4	2012-03-18 00:00:00	Absolutely love this place! We chose to go to breakfast on a Tuesday and only had to wait 30 minutes for this delish meal! It was a good time to look over the menu and decide what we wanted to eat. The menu isn't big but everything looks good! Since we were only getting to try one meal at this place, I decided to go all out and get the Chop and Chick with a side of the bacon and a strawberry honey lemonade. The food was amazing. Hash browns all the way! And the bacon...oh the bacon...and the bacon! It was worth it for me to get the extra side of bacon. Did I mention the bacon? \n\nI do have a critique on the lemonade. It was a bit too sweet for my liking. So i diluted it with a bit of water and that made it just right for me. I'm going to have to try other menu items...I'm not a fan of waiting an hour, so it might have to go again during the week to avoid the much talked about morning crowds. You gotta try this place if you are in Phoenix!	3	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	TxHx1fb8O_MsfQB_ODdTQg	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ
ZXW49i_Afn0I1ophTxwajg	2	2010-09-11 00:00:00	If the Chop and Chick is Guy Fieri's favorite breakfast dish, his credibility has dropped a few points.  I wanted to like it... heck, this was one of the reasons I drove out to Phoenix, but the pork chop didn't do it for me.  It was dry and there just wasn't enough pesto to grab my attention.\n \nThe hash browns saved the meal for me though.  They reminded me of the way my mom used to make them: very thinly-sliced, a little on the oily side and extremely crispy.  I can eat this forever.\n \nYes, the place is small and the wait is long, but I won't dock any points for that, even though it was in 100+ degree weather; waiting is all part of the experience.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	K6Z1NU_ofX4yiUqWtV1jNA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

My wife always gives me a strip of bacon from her plate, and I must say, they have excellent bacon there.  It's a nice thick cut of bacon, which is right up my alley.\n\nThe service is as it should be.  No frills, but they get the job done.  That's all I really care about.  I'm almost never in the mood for the fake banter you get from chain restaurant servers.\n\nThere is a little bit of a wait, but people who are not originally from AZ are used to waiting 2x as long, so it's not really a big deal to me.\n\nI'd eat here again.	1	0	0	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	KK7e-aAKWbzDsMD9UGu1HQ	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

I tried taking her here once, but the line out the door was ridiculous; Even today there was a bit of a wait, and it wouldn't have been so taxing if it weren't so cold!  (We arrived at 10:15a, sat down at 10:45a, and had our meals delivered at around 11:10a.  Again, the wait times wouldn't have been so bad if my Mom wasn't due to be at the airline gate at 11:40a!)\nMom ordered the 3-egg salami omelette and hash browns w/ cranberry-walnut toast http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=-gdeqfSkpFBnCfkRo3Lcng#-gdeqfSkpFBnCfkRo3Lcng, while I had the ham steak, hash browns, eggs (over-medium, please!), and whole-grain toast.http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ?select=OCEqJ846dKKtI2TLJ3mg5Q#OCEqJ846dKKtI2TLJ3mg5Q  (Let me just say that we both LOVED the cranberry-walnut toast!  Is it MJ bread or from Simply Bread??  I've got to get a hold of some to have at home!)  I enjoyed the ham steak and the hash browns were wonderful, as always.  Eggs are always delicious here- aren't they from local Hickman Farms?  Mom didn't enjoy her omelette so much- too much salami!  I don't like salami, but I tried a bite anyway.  Yep, I STILL don't like salami...  However, she did enjoy the eggs, after picking off most of the meat, and the bread w/ the plum jam.\nI'm always happy when my Mom enjoys herself at a restaurant that I take her to, so thank you MBB for helping her start her vacation right!	7	3	6	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

We waited 45 minutes at 10 am on a Sunday morning and it was SO worth the wait!  The bacon was semi-sweet, super thick, and had peppery spices on it.  The eggs were fluffy and were so good they did not need salt.  The potatoes had rosemary or lavendar or something and were amazing.  My husband had the steak, it was phenomenal, my bro and sis in law had pancakes that were the best I've ever tasted.  This meal was so good it was almost erotic.  Hubby and I slept all day after.

But its true.. All 200+ rave reviews are spot on... \n\nMatts. Is. The. Shit. \n\nIf it weren't for the long-ass wait in the three thousand degree AZ summer heat, I'd probably be there on a regular, but sorry dudes, I am a ginger kid, and I burn. I also have no soul, but you all already knew that.\n\nAnyway.\n\nI was skeptical for, ohhh, about a year... yes, it took me that long to actually muster up the patience to deal with the wait.. but I have very persuasive friends who have really good ideas., so last Saturday, I went, and the fact that its been almost a week since i've tasted the sweet spuds in their hashbrowns makes me want to cry. They are seriously, one of the most delicious things ive ever eaten. I got the Chop & Chick.. because i love pigs and eating them. The pork was perfect, nicely seasoned, tender and delicious. I got my eggs over medium, because egg yolk is one of my favorite things to dip shit in, and an order of home fries because the waitress said the hash browns were "kinda funky, not like usual", that day.. but she lied. or maybe she didn't, but my friend got them and either way, they were amazing. My friends got the 5 spot (breakfast sandwich thing) & the daily special (some chorizo mexicany mash up of yum), which were both equally amazing, but for real, my yolk covered pork chop superseded anything those fools were eating. Its been on my mind for days.\n\nAs usual, I drank way too much coffee, but what I should have done was order a chocolate milk like my good friend Georgie S. had.. For whatever reason, it was better than any other chocolate milk in the universe.\n\nIts small, cramped, kinda retro, no booze and there is no bathroom.. but whatever, I like places like this. its totally worth it, and did I mention its CHEAP?!\n\nGo here at least once in your life. Make sure to get the HB's and visit The Downtown Phoenix Farmers Market across the street when you're finished. Its the perfect way to start your Saturday.	11	7	5	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ	MCTmcFSTp4Xewa5UM-mbMA	700	-050d_XIor1NpCuWkbIVaQ

We walked in, ran into a couple friends and joined a table on the patio. We were then greated by the hostess, who "greeted" us with a "so you guys just seat yourself then? I guess I will get you some menus". She then came back warning us that "next time you would be in big trouble for this". Safe to say we abandoned ship and walked out. We returned to Postino and all is well. Welcomed with open arms and a drink prepared.\nSidenote: the manager came over to not only apologize for the insensitive hostess but also to offer free tacos for the terrible experience. She deserves the 2 stars. The hostess however, deserves the zero star review. She was rude and being someone that works a 100% costumer service position, she would be let go considering how we were treated. She isn't doing you any favors. Better luck next time.	4	4	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	mz-tqIBJd7Q8y-eCpN-wfQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The best part of this place was the service. We had our cups constantly refilled and people asking us if we needed anything. They kept on bringing chips and salsa to our table the entire time. The only reason why I'm not giving this place a 5 star is because the price was a little high. It was just me and my husband during lunch. We ordered water and we both had the street tacos.

I think I ate about 14 little yellow flowers and seeds. Plus, a bird dropped a poo on my handbag. You've been warned.\n\nAnywho, I ordered 3 happy hour tacos thinking they were the street taco sized version. WRONG! They were full sized and crammed with meat, slaw and guacamole. A great value at a couple bucks each. I could only eat 2 and the best one was the Standard. I don't even remember what was in it, it was just yummy! The carne asada taco had a one little bite of gristle :/\n\nI asked the waiter which margarita he would  recommend; I saw several interesting flavors. Surprisingly he suggested a skinny margarita (I tried not to be offended). He was right though, it was a perfect balance of sweet and sour and just enough tequila. \n\nI really enjoyed the vibe, along with the fresh food at Joyride.

0B12lzDzzLhob9cdEhQjWg	5	2015-11-28 00:00:00	We were looking for a tasty Mexican restaurant and saw favorable reviews for Joyride. We were not disappointed. Located in the heart of old town Gilbert, Joyride is nestled between two other restaurants. We sat outside on a relatively cool day but were kept warm by the fireplace and space heaters. The salsa is outstanding with a kick and the Cadillac margarita delicious. We had a variety of tacos which are served on outstanding corn tortillas. Wonderful flavored. Impeccable, attentive service; we were brought more salsa without having to ask and were asked if we wanted more chips. Highly recommended.	1	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Rrqx9bGpuT0W6MOgyFi8gg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

0fUuKrqV1WXYTWaBXXuWWw	5	2014-09-11 00:00:00	We decided to stop here after finding it on Yelp - so glad we did. The atmosphere is casual, but not overly so. Our server, Taylor, was one of the most knowledgable and bubbly servers I've ever had. She knew about all the food and had great recommendations (based on our tastes) and even made me feel just fine for ordering an item plain (standard taco with just chicken and cheese). The blood orange margarita is phenomenal and not terribly priced. I HIGHLY recommend the "Better than Betty's" dessert - it's brownie, ice cream, caramel, and walnuts but oh man. So delicious. If you're in the area - make it a point to check this place out...ASK FOR TAYLOR (this is extremely important)...and get some dessert. You'll thank me for it later. Ugh...so full.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	PLOj4rsYmTGjuw0WkoiXIA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

They were a little bland despite warnings that they were spicy.  However, once I added some of their salsa to them they were good chicken tacos.  I like their decor.  I have eaten their once alone at the bar and the service was quick and super friendly and once with friends during the busy Christmas season... Service was a little slower but food was great and waiter was fun.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	C0Kh_GSWNCas-EieY5P_kA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

We also tried the nachos and the guacamole. Both were quite tasty. The ambience of this place is pretty great as well. Nice open space. It can get pretty loud and crowded, especially on the weekends. All in all I think joyride is tasty and a fun place to eat. I'd go back for sure and would recommend it to most.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	zRsVs4X1zP4p8Qed-qEMRA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Our server was very friendly and helpful with recommendations. A total plus was that it happened to be happy hour! $2 tacos and $5 pitchers. What's strange is that a pint of beer is $6 but $5 for a pitcher during happy hour, so I clearly had to go for the pitcher. I ordered the crispy fish tacos. The breading was delicious but I wasn't too keen on the fish used inside. Overall a great experience and I definitely recommend this place.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	iIBjzFYJzCxnRwFLPxRqGg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Some spicy, some with crunchy slaw, fresh avocado, and just the right balance of flavors.  Impressive beer list.  I had a Deshuttes Black Butte; paired nicely with the spicy tacos.  Service was outstanding; only waited about 10 minutes for a table for two.   Packed house.  Family friendly but great tunes playing as well.  Heated patios.  Loved it.

Paying two dollars to get some extra chips and salsa when historically they were free is unacceptable.

It was DELICIOUS! One of the best salads I've ever had really! It tastes healthy & full of flavor! (I had it without the bell pepper!) \n\nI've tried a couple of the tacos- they are a little too "different" for my taste, but they aren't bad- just not for me. \n\nI had the mango-mandarin margarita & it was very tasty! Many people love the prickly pear margarita, they are bright pink & really attractive for a cocktail! \n\nI highly recommend the salad, chips & salsa & drinks here!	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	xXJud2Ml1_vIq4dZX39ybg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

My friend said the beans were kind of bland and the veggies didn't really go with the plate but she enjoyed her tamales.

Love the hipster atmosphere, margaritas, fresh agua frescos, crispy fish taco, THE FILA SALAD, and don't event get me started on the churros.

All their GF items are marked on the menu, even their tortilla chips are gluten-free, where many restaurants contaminate the chips by frying them in the same fryer used on breaded items. \n\nEverything we have had here so far was excellent. Baja and carnitas tacos rank as my favs. I also think their tortilla soup is outstanding. I don't do a lot of mixed drinks, but my wife loves the blood-orange margarita. I tasted it. Good and strong. The atmosphere is nice, staff is on their game and bathrooms were clean. \n\nOnce it gets cooler, this place will be even better. They can open large doors to two separate patios. Maybe even bring in some talented, live local music, like Vinyl Station.	1	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	spjg3bmNei6cXfUjhQZICA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The salsa was amazing.\n\nGreat assortment of items on the menu, amd honestly, everything sounded delicious. I opted for the Beast in a bowl, which was Carne asada, beans, avocado, salsa and rice, along with a side order of veggies, which I was told was roasted tomatoes but when it got here, they were actually fried brussel sprouts. \n\nLoved the interior, the folks working behind the bar, and the food too of course.

Seconds after being seated we were brought iced waters and chips with salsa. The chips and salsa were great, the salsa had just the right amount of spice and was very fresh. \n\nWe were soon greeted by our server Justin, he was awesome. Made great drink recommendations including the pineapple mojito which I decided to go with, it was delicious! So refreshing! My fiancé went with the horchata with captain morgan, another suggestion from Justin and he was not disappointed.\n\nFor our meal we decided to get an array of tacos. We literally loved every one we tried. Out favorites included the ahi tuna, crispy fish and shrimp. They really all were great tho. \n\nLastly, we ended the meal with the churros. They come with a chocolate dipping sauce however our server recommended getting the caramel sauce as well, good thing we did, the caramel was delicious. \n\nLong story short we will definitely be back and hope to see Justin again!

Despite the stress of a brand new restaurant immediately flooded by 100's of customers, Joyride held up extremely well. \n\nDrinks were served in regular fashion. Mike, the bartender, and Chris, also a bartender, served Mazaltan Mules with short delay. What ever wait we had, the taste, texture, and payload of the drink more than made up for it. We also tried the Agua Fresca's.... yum. Fruity with a kick.\n\nI am delighted. \n\nLauren, the manager of Joyride, was on point without being in the face of her staff. She genuinely cares about her restaurant. I know sometimes new places get a bad rap here on yelp when they begin as they work out the bumps. I urge you to speak with her prior to giving anything less than a 4. She's pretty real. \n\nThank you, Joyride. Thank you. I will be back... lots.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	9jivURdGBHoUBpy4_kR_gw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

4hHILqEfTLpxWFumyqyrbg	2	2015-05-23 00:00:00	For starters, the place has a lovely atmosphere. We came in on a Saturday afternoon. They had the large roll up doors open, which allowed a nice breeze in, great way to enjoy a nice day. The service was quite slow. Friendly, but a bit inattentive. The complimentary chips were good, with salsa that actually had a nice kick to it. Now for the main foods...\n\nI ordered the Fila salad. Very fresh ingredients and nice presentation. Salads are about $10 a pop, then an extra $3 to add meat. It was good, but nothing to rave about. For $13.50 I just wasn't that impressed. BF ordered the Beast burrito, chimi style, with shredded beef. It was surprisingly bland.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	BSmRrcyV0nC9sXdPpTzGXw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
4LbKkWFRfQb8VC5MuzhEEA	4	2015-06-06 00:00:00	So I have been trying to try all the cool new food joints in downtown Gilbert. Today it was Joyride Taco house. It was a weekday, so less of a crowd, always a good thing. Our server "Floyd" seated us quickly. we told her this was our first time here and she told us about how everything is Fresh,  home made . To start they bring out this crazy great salsa, I was blown away by its unique flavor. It was with a hint of sweet, citrus, spice, chunky, which equalled a explosion of awesome flavors!!! We had the lunch special. We each picked three tacos with a free side. The crispy fish taco is insane! The grilled fish taco a close second. The braised beef is good, but the fish is my favorite. My wife too loved the crispy fish and really loved "The standard" chicken taco.The Tacos are not big, but three of them was enough. Me and my wife shared a bowl of Tortilla soup, fresh, and soooo good. We will be back for sure, got to try other things, but it will be hard not to order the fish tacos again. Thanks to our very nice and helpful server, she made our visit even nicer!!	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	TSqSXQTXTE4VKh39_ocYDw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

4ROUfyPcn9z2Eyhs9K8JnQ	4	2014-05-04 00:00:00	Just enjoyed a pretty lovely dinner at the bar. We walked up and the wait for a table was 50 minutes, but the bar is first come first serve and we magically found two seats next to each other at 7:30 on a Saturday night. Kismet. \n\nThe bar is big and comfortable, a wrap-around that's probably big enough for 30 people. My only complaint is there wasn't a place for my purse, I would love a hook for it underneath the bar. Our server was attentive and we got a smaller pitcher (about 2.5 beers) of good beer for $7, which I thought was a pretty stellar deal.\n\nThe complimentary chips and salsa came out hot and spicy. The salsa was good to me, I love cilantro and smoky heat and it delivered. I ordered three tacos, the standard, carnitas and tuna, and also got the refried beans. It was all delicious, from the tortilla to the toppings! My favorite was honestly the standard - it was the quintessential street taco. Delicious marinated chicken with smooth avocado and a great pico on top. \n\nI'd definitely recommend it, and we'll for sure be back!	2	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	4zYIcJNAaiYHZkRPcGb_tA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
4YOAxzqppdZlkEAmOVgMtQ	3	2014-10-22 00:00:00	I also wanted to write a great review of this place. Especially when they opened the sliding doors and it was such a great night. First of all i remember all too well the old saying "if its too loud, your too old"! Yep, im too old. Perhaps its because its partly a bar but i really don't want to eat with really loud music. I'll drink with really loud music. But i don't want agita! ( thats my old Italian lady word). Off the bat the chips were way salty. That may just be me. Im kind of salt sensitive. I was excited for the tomatillo salsa since its not easy to get. Disappointed, it was bland and had an off taste. My daughter had 2 tacos. One beef, one pork. She downed them both. Preferring the pork. They looked great. I had the tamales with rice and veggies. The rice was bland but i was starving. The veggies standard but tasty. The tamale was extremely tasty and saved the meal for me. Also, the staff was easy going, not rushed and ver accommodating.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	qRBwjITH-Ltje3H_1y2bZg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
4ZkPTDwmgFpHRu5sR7_2DQ	2	2015-08-08 00:00:00	We went twice and had okay-poor experiences both times and haven't been back.  Both times the hostesses seemed generally uninterested and couldn't even manage a smile.  Both times the service at the bar was slow, I get it when the bar is busy but you have to acknowledge a customer when they arrive at the bar; ie, "I see you, I'll be right with you".  The food was okay, the fish and shrimp tacos were good, the chicken tacos had no flavor and everything is pretty pricey for what you get.  I did not like their signature drinks (maybe it's just my taste) they were very sweet and had the consistency of puréed fruit.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	-lg4J2SOILBJOxqH4S0x4g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

All of their staff have Beautiful personalities and every experience I've had was just perfect!

522BA9Xgmx1dub7v1XRAbg	2	2014-05-26 00:00:00	Not impressed. \n\nI realize its a holiday but maybe management could have planned better.. The wait wasn't ridiculous it just seemed like chaos everywhere, free for all if you will..\n\nThe location and concept are on point though a little over ambitious, it seemed like everything on the menu had one or two too many ingredients making it just a little over complicated.\n\nThe reason for two stars is the poor execution of a great idea.. EVERYTHING (nearly, pinto beans were piping) was Cold, eck!! Side of chicken, roasted veggies and tacos all intended to be eaten warm were luke warm at best.  It lends concern to the "danger zone" theory. And why so hot on the beans but so temped on everything else? Microwave maybe? Either way, ew!! Plus side my salad was cold but oddly closer to that room temperature feel (given over 100° outside cold to warm food is acceptable, warm to cold is just inconceivable this time of year)..\n\nLastly I feel like they were a little over priced for the size of tacos we received. Like tiny small, I'm all for quality ingredients but lack there of is kind of a slight at $3-$4 a PIECE.. \n\nI would be willing to give it one more try, but I won't be going out of my way if I have a choice..	2	2	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	V_5qEY4-1YzO_vI88Tx5WQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The fish tacos. Yup, don't question it, don't argue it, don't even be hesitant. (Because I was a bit.. something about fish tacos always sorta made me worried of trying it) - Absolutely the best taco of the 3 I tried. Sorta sad, I almost don't remember the other 2. A chicken adobo, and some pork one? Both really great as well, but that fish taco. Yup, its a winner. If you're looking for a good app, go with their street corn. It was tender, and crazy delicious! Their margaritas are fantastic, and their super hot salsa, didn't melt my face like it claims, but was spicy, and fantastic. Ask for Breezy, she is a rock star. The only disappointment with this place, is that it doesn't exist in Kansas, which is where I live.. which is awful.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	eAyVdLX9KhAbBQsz40ma4Q	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
5eU-E6-NXDatGtBBphLkGg	5	2015-11-16 00:00:00	Restaurants have 3 things they need to ensure in order to be successful: \n\nFirst is good food.  That's the most important obviously.  Even if you hate everything else about a place you may come back if the food is good.  The food at Joyride is good.  Everything that came our way was presented well, tasted great, and was ample in portions.\n\nSecond is to make sure you have a good time and are taken care of.  Primarily, this requires good servers and providing value for your money.  The service here was a delight.  We actually got forgotten about and not served for 10 minutes but the waitress was so friendly and enjoyable that it was easy to forgive.  Regarding the value, the daily happy hour until 5 on drinks makes it hard to complain about.  \n\nThe last thing you need, to me, to be successful as a restaurant is "it."  You know "it" when you see it.  Joyride has "it."  The atmosphere is enjoyable, the layout of the tables is comfortable, the patio is delightful, the colors are fun...everything just works.  \n\nThis was my first time at Joyride and I'm itching to go back already.  A great place.	1	1	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	sOudRDE_R3VYni0rEYFkSA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

5iKwgj0ZNSDUruezrvKsBQ	2	2013-06-09 00:00:00	Thought overall it was an expensive meal for Mexican and have had better for sure.  The margaritas overall are average, but expensive at $9 a piece.  Better off with the pitchers of beer as those are cheaper.  Ordered the rockfish ceviche for an appetizer, which was nice and fresh tasting.  I have never been to a Mexican restaurant before where chips and salsa were not free of charge.  Not at this place and would not pay extra for salsa.  Got the Beast burrito, which the meat was flavored well, but with no typical sides was kind of disappointing.  Too much hype for a new restaurant.  Think you are just paying for the ambience.  In my book, Mexican should not be an expensive experience.\n\nBy the way, I like how Yelp filtered this review even though it is real.  I've had this happen before when writing negative reviews for places.  No doubt I ate there yesterday at the restaurant!	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	IWw0Tqa5T2ADKTktT9F67Q	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

5UQcBX-v9-Yv43QA1mga2w	2	2017-05-22 00:00:00	I wanted to love this place as I've been wanting to go for quite some time.  I went as I was passing through one day. It was a nice day but I wanted to sit inside as it was a bit windy outside. I asked to be seated away from the open side door but it was still very windy (no big deal though, it is Arizona)... I sat at the bar and the waitress/bartender was very friendly and helpful.  I decided to go with the grilled fish tacos and kale salad.  I was disappointed as the fish was very dry! I probably should have sent them back but I was running late for an appointment and didn't have time.  I would give them another try as the place has a fun atmosphere and I loved the salsa which to me is a food group!

5v5QE0yNlQuyqG4lDPCT2g	3	2014-04-24 00:00:00	Ok, I get why this place is so popular. It is decorated uber-cool and has great music. Unfortunately the popularity means that we had to wait 45 minutes for a table. That would have been ok if it weren't for the fact that A - the hostess told us it would only be 15 minutes and B - she took our drink orders and my friend's credit card and then never came back and C - we saw multiple other parties that arrived after us were seated before we were. We sat outside in the lawn chairs, drinkless, until my friend went and tracked her down to find out what was going on. And even after we were moved to a table inside and greeted by Josh, our server, she still had a hard time getting the credit card back. After that we had to wait another 15-20 minutes just to be able to order.\n\nOverall, the service was pretty terrible. Apparently the owners think that 3 teenagers are enough waitstaff for the entire restaurant and bar and that plus the fact that they pool tips means that none of them really care about whether the guests have a good experience. The drinks were also hit or miss. I really enjoyed my cucumber agua fresca even though it was a little too sweet for me. But another friend got the blood orange margarita and it was awful. I am not sure if it was made wrong or what but since Josh's visits to our table were few and far between she didn't have an opportunity to send it back.\n\nSo, why 3 whole stars you ask? Well, the tacos were pretty tasty. We all got the three taco plate because with three you get the free side. The orange cucumber salad was definitely worth it. I ordered the braised beef, grilled fish, and cochinita pibil. The pork on was a little underwhelming but the other two were outstanding. The fish was cooked perfectly and I loved the flavor of the beef. Other favorites from my girlfriends were the shrimp and veggie tacos. The tacos were all pretty small so you should definitely order 2 or 3 of them. So, overall the meal ended up being about $12. Not bad. But the drinks were really overpriced so that balanced out. Overall, I was happy with the quality of the food and it would be a pretty cool place to hang out if they could improve their staff.	3	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Tsm8VraTp5OGyVALtUiCeQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The flavor doesn't really jive for me but it's always busy so I'm assuming someone else's taste buds click for The Joy. This is atypical bc I usually eat about anything.

6D8ToN59Wl1QZDsMQU0S1w	2	2014-11-22 00:00:00	My friends have been hyping this place up so I tried it today on a business lunch. I liked the atmosphere. The music and the open feel we nice, and the service was very good. Food came out fast as well. That's about where it ends. I had 3 different tacos, two of which I would probably never order again, with the third being just ok. The chips and salsa were not that good and the rice was average. I think if you wanna go somewhere uber-trendy and way over-pay for tacos that are not that good and are definitely not Mexican food, then this is the place for you.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	OmzcUDhM1HF6C4emuadZFQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The guacamole was excellent.  The only disappointment was the margarita.  It was very weak and just not good.  Fish taco will bring me back, but the $9.00!margarita needs to be better.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	DSGqMIbmFPOHxy0n23geVw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

We tried to make the Happy Hour but just missed it by about 20 minutes (FYI, HH is all day until 5pm). Not so bummed b/c the prices were reasonable especially when you factor the OUTSTANDING service and the fresh ingredients. Made to Order corn tortillas for your tacos! It won't get any fresher unless you grind the corn at your table. We had the fish tacos...unbelievable! We usually rate a place by their nachos but already have a new Fav place. Its a mix of people who dine in there retro-ish looking place, low music (which is nice for conversation). Can't wait to go back and try other items like their nachos, aqua fresca and melt your face salsa! See you there	1	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	2M6CJQQSMQ5QDGnOlCQazw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I might be over selling a tad bit, BUT this definitely a place you want to try out, their tacos are seriously great tasting.

This might be my new favorite spot!\n\nOne thing I would change, is I would love for these tacos to be a crispy shell. The soft was good, but crispy would have been the BEST (for most tacos, not all). Maybe the option to choose???	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	iF1SlKmMJgn9O1XYXLoeXg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

6rAuz_47SZuv93-CdTnxRw	1	2015-08-07 00:00:00	Joyride is a bad restaurant to go to because the music is far too loud. Also their margaritas are of very low quality, using only the cheapest possible ingredients. I don't know why they need a bartender because they serve what could be a store bought margarita mix. The cost of two margaritas and a diet pepsi was $22. Also, Joyride as no blender, so all they make is margaritas on the rocks. Why they would not have a blender is totally illogical. The waiter actually said, "it we would be great if we had a blender." Joyride is the type of restaurant that you have a hard time believing is still in business. \n\nWe were not able to stay to actually eat anything becuase the restaurant itself was so unpleasant to stay in. But the restaurant is clearly focused on style over substance.	1	3	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	b46ZM3Zs3dEReu1sln3rww	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

First they provided is a spot to park our stroller because it didn't fit by our table. We ordered and the food came quickly, the sissy refills were on point too (I believe our servers name was Taylor). I had three tacos with three different types of meat which were delicious. The carnitas was my favorite. The tortillas even seemed hand made. The place had really cool art on the wall. I saw some Star Wars stuff which is always cool. The only thing I kinda bothered me was that the music was too loud because it took away from having a conversation.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	UHizZOzxGzhARFactaBKYg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
6W0qaDCyG2_Q82W7Zm65xw	5	2013-09-15 00:00:00	I've had this place bookmarked on yelp to try for awhile so I was excited when to come here with my boyfriend last night. This place is located in downtown Gilbert right next to Postinos. Since it was a Friday night the wait was long but We got there just before the rush so we only had to wait 40min. The inside was very hipster and the servers were all very friendly. They brought out the chips and salsa right away. It was so good we got seconds :) I had a coupon for a free appetizer so we started off with the Ahi Tuna Ceviche. It was a nice twist using ahi tuna on the ceviche instead of the usual shrimp. I got the crispy fish,chicken Tinga and short rib tacos. My boyfriend got the carne Asada, shrimp and Baja fish. I would defiantly recommend the crispy fish and shrimp tacos!!! The tacos were the perfect size and very flavorful. The only down side is that the tacos range from 3.50 to 4.50 per taco. A bit on the pricey side for the small tacos but there so tasty ;) then they gave us free dessert because of how long we had to wait to get our table. They didn't have  to do that for us but we defiantly appreciated it. We ordered the churros and took it home to eat. The churros were nice and crispy! I defiantly would come back & recommend this place to try.	2	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	dlOYCLB7XKORL-BE9lnPnA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
6Z5dOVBAPpXrUoj5VK0hfw	3	2013-08-09 00:00:00	Well, it's not bad...but it's not great either. Walking in I was pumped to hear Deltron through the speakers and see the place was not as pretentious as I had heard from the grape vine. Since I'm not one for negativity I'll start out with some positives. A wide selection of aguas frescas with the option of adding booze to it was quite a delight, and the salsa they bring out with your complimentary chips was actually tasty as a mofo. Service was pretty good and,,, well...that's about it. If you are going to be charging around 4 bucks each for mf'n street tacos they better be amazing, the truth is they were not. You could score a hell of a better fish taco at rubios, the cochinito pibil tasted like a corona with a few cigarette butts floating inside, and the short rib was alright...just kick up the seasoning. A few adjustments and this place could be a gem.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	zBjjw11k4Ck6hmyxxkOFfw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Realizing all these local Gilbert restaurants do not take reservations is a huge turn off for us. 6:30, and it was a 45 minute wait for a party of 2 and honestly the managing of the table space is ridiculous...sitting 2 people in a huge booth for easily 6. Badly designed, bad seating management.\n\nThe food as I had reviewed before was really good, service was excellent. The $8 Citrus Vodka was so weak (not worth the calories). The basic margaritas were excellent. We had the Guacamole and Chips, 3 Taco platter with a side, and The Beast burritos w/no sauce.\n\nIf we came again for dinner I would either advice eating earlier (then I feel like an early bird "snow bird") or coming late late.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	pgUQjUl_2G5L9EreDzIjSw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Cool atmosphere, though it seems like the outside part of the property could be set up in a more useful way (looks nice but not too many chairs or tables.)  We ate at the bar both times and service was exceptional.  They were friendly and very attentive but not overly hovering/checking in like some places do.  The first time there they had an accidental corn on the cob appetizer they had an extra of and the bartender asked us if we wanted it.  I thought that was nice, since most places would chuck an extra rather than give it out for free.  They also had a pretty decent beer special.  Can't remember exactly what it was but something like $5 small pitcher during HH, and that was for good beer (Kiltlifter) not the cheap stuff.  Tacos were delicious, I liked the standard fried fish the best (I ordered a combo of three types.)	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	-M3Sszagd3XfThOxyFj2Cg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Their tacos are great with beautiful presentation. Tortilla soup has a fresh taste with a subtle kick so be careful if you're not good with spicy food. \nI came during happy hour so I decided to order a fresh pineapple  juice with rum. However, I'm pretty sure they forgot to put rum in there. The manager happened to check on us right then so I told him I didn't really taste the alcohol. Immediately, I watched him making me a new drink at the bar. This time, he made sure he filled the glass with what tasted like 50% rum ;) Great service recovery. Will definitely come back again to try another dish on the menu.	3	0	2	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	yHMNrMBSvzw_fxBAyPCo_A	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

First time I went, i was pleasantly surprised at the authenticity of the food.  The carne asada tacos were cooked perfectly, had great flavor, as did the pork carnitas.\n\nTheir salsa is good...a little mild--ask for the hot, you'll love it.

However, we were surprised with our extremely disappointing experience. \n\nThe first problem started when we ordered our drinks, one didn't come, the others took forever to get, and one of the drinks (the mule) was overly sweet and gross. This was sad as we loved the drinks here prior to this visit.\n\nThe second problem we encountered were menu items we loved and came back for taken off the menu. No more delicious scallop tacos and no more roast chicken. Instead, we decided to try some new things and order the crispy fish taco we loved before. The fish taco came and it was fishy. Once again it took forever to get our food and some of it came out incorrectly. Of the things we tried we had the sidewalk dish which was just meh. \n\nThe final problem is one I am just assuming to be the case. I think they may have taken the amazing chef that opened Joyride and moved him to the Phoenix location, but who knows. \n\nNot sure if we will be going back which is sad considering how much we loved this place when it first opened.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	DQ5Szn4T14ddEd6F5jHHpg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

So they passed my margarita test. \n\nCrispy and fresh chips and very savory salsa were offered and they are really really.good.  \n\nThen not being so hungry i ordered just the fish taco, no rice or beens.  Satisfying and tasty.  \n\nThe bar was pleasant and not crowded at the time and the bartenders were very attentive and nice.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	1_5nIwuBJ9_5H7cN5WBuQw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
9INmVjS18lNsQItjnpj9Tg	5	2015-04-24 00:00:00	Came here with a small group of coworkers today and we all had a great time. The staff was very friendly and fun. Our particular waiter looked like he was training someone, but that did not stop him from providing great service to us. Our chip, salsa and drink refills were great. Everyone seemed to like being at work and help out with all tables. It is a little confusing when you aren't quite sure if the man or woman walking by is a waiter or guest, name tags or something would be helpful lol. The menu is nice and simple and the presentation is very clean. Our beans and rice needed a little salt, but that's probably that healthy effort kicking in. I had the carne asada, carnitas and standard tacos, they were sooo good. I WILL be back to try more of their items, I would like to see this place in the evenings. Seems like a cool place to sit and have some drinks. No complaints from anyone in our party, definitely happy with this establishment.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	xxX8hetWDR6VMjXWni13oA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

9slQ8RuiVXaSlqP_ou2ZNw	4	2015-09-07 00:00:00	Just tried this over the weekend. Went with a friend of mine and our tacos were yummy! Loved the hip/trendy décor. We each ordered three tacos to get the free side. I ordered the carne asadas and one Baja fish and a side of beans. She ordered one Baja, one chicken, and one shrimp and a side of orange cucumber salad. I loved my carne asada, the fish was fresh but I wish it was more tasty. She didn't like her chicken very much, liked the fish, but said the shrimp was the best. We both liked our sides - actually she loved her cucumber side! My side of beans was very generous and could have been split between both of us. Service was efficient, wish it was a little more friendly but can tell they wanted you in and out.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	EaQViz7gRVx7RrxntSoSQw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
9TV6mOYjBymuVgdsLC-zbQ	4	2016-03-28 00:00:00	Today I tried Joyride Taco House for the first time. There was a lot of rave and talk about this place, so I have been wanting to try it. It is usually really crowded, so I never want to wait, but since today was Easter, there was no wait. I read a lot of reviews about the service not being good, but all of the staff, waiters and waitresses were nice to us. I got a carne asada taco and the standard taco. They were both pretty good, but I think the carne asada taco was better than the standard taco. The tacos were both $3.75, but on Tuesdays they are $2. You get complementary chips, salsa and water right away before you even have time to look at one thing on the menu. They were quick with that which I liked. The restaurant is pretty hipstery and cool. I like the feel. I would recommend this place to other people.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	0jLyXYnYYw11QYaz8nv_mQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I was blown away by the rockstar service provided to us by our waitress Breezy. She was amazing!! The food, however, was a complete surprise. It was fresh and flavorful and out of this world! Especially the blood orange Margarita, the charred habenero salsa, mexican corn ( heavens to betsy was it amazing) orange cucumber salad and the crispy fish taco which we couldn't get enough of so we ordered several more to go! This was a happy accident and I will be back for more.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	ZdAopt6pIe7dF6_8brf7_Q	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

9XZS6cTCm2UENCRzMH4MQA	3	2014-11-15 00:00:00	I have eaten here several times and from what I've seen, the experience at Joyride is consistent. So the positives are the atmosphere, service, and drinks. Whoever designed this place did a really great job at creating a hipster environment that is also really comfortable. There is a great outdoor seating area and all of the design choices are happy and pleasant. Service has also always been friendly and efficient. The other major upside is the drinks, which are well made, creative, and delicious. They have a nice nonalcoholic selection as well. \n\nThe major downfall at Joyride is unfortunately the food. It isn't awful, but it's just not very good. I have had a variety of tacos, the torta, and some forgettable huevos rancheros type thing and none of it has been any good. I mean, it's edible, but it just falls so flat in flavor. Pretty much everything needs more salt and spice. Even the salsas are really quite bland. \n\nIf they improved the food situation, this place would be five stars, no question. As it is though, I'd stick with drinks and eat at any one of the other more delicious choices within walking distance of Joyride.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	8p28iwg0tb26IJE-FG5CQQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Got a taco combo and split with the hubby crispy fish, baja fish and the standard side of black beans and a carnita taco. Would skip the crispy fish next time, beans were ok. Others were above average but the soft corn tortillas get messy fast so eat quickly.

afrUQC74JsgKZ2MjgMFuVw	2	2016-03-18 00:00:00	Been here a number of times, decided that I've gone enough to write a review. \n\nPutting it in bullet points to make it easier to read: \n\nPROS:\n- Cool looking spot to hang out with friends (Not completely friendly to large groups).\n- Outdoor seating area is nice on a warm night. \n- When waiting for seating to open up, they have a texting service so you can wander about (but don't wander too far!).\n- Drink TASTE is decent. \n- They give you chips and salsa when you're waiting (They do charge $1 for refills).\n\n\nCONS:\n- Drink prices are on the higher side. \n- Food prices are a little ridiculous as well (I guess you're 'paying' for the atmosphere as well).\n- While staff are friendly, but guest service is pretty horrendous. \n- Food takes WAY too long to get out to you, so forget coming here with a large group of people (as mentioned earlier).\n- The food isn't the most exciting in terms of taste. \n\nOverall  the price you see on the check I believe is too high for the quality of service and quality of food/drink you receive. If the service greatly improved, I wouldn't have a problem with how much the bill comes out to. \n\nGo at your own risk! Hopefully, you have a better time than myself.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	vlWF9N8ZxLenP_nwyiCfcQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
afzbYAlHS7eQ6W4yWxNECw	2	2014-01-12 00:00:00	Just a mediocre experience.\n\nMy friends and I had a reservation for 8 at 7pm.  We were seated immediately upon arrival on a busy Friday night in the patio area.  Our waiter was nice and made good suggestions.  The food is just okay; nothing to brag about.  The tacos are very expensive for what they give you (average price is $4 for a SINGLE small street style taco a la carte).  The tacos come out on a rack family-style.  So while in the dark environment of the patio and main dining area, you pay $4 for a tiny taco and have to search all over the table to find your taco (RIDICULOUS- the waiter tells you all the tacos on the rack and then you go racing to find yours).  The drinks are average for their prices.\n\nAfter dining, my friends and I were chatting at the table and catching up (pretty normal post dining activity).  About 8:30pm, a hostess asked us to leave our table as they had to accommodate a reservation at 8:45pm.  WOW....I don't think I have EVER been asked to leave a restaurant.  She hostess did ask in a nice manner and handed out coupons for free tacos as to make up for asking us to leave. \n\nWe ended moving our party to the outside of the restaurant to continue chatting.  By 9:30PM, no party had ever been seated at our table!   \n\nI will never return to this restaurant.  Paying over $40 for 2 tacos and 2 drinks and being rudely asked to leave my table is just not worth it.	1	1	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	1mRNIMViqe_LrJLV5Q969w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
AgAHEiV7UYXjyIihFvIZ5g	4	2016-05-20 00:00:00	I've been here twice and plan on going back again!  My first visit was almost a year ago. It was a Friday night and really busy. My friend and I were given a 45 min -hour wait but we were lucky that some people left the bar so we ate there. The tacos and drinks were great and I kept telling myself I have to come back!\nI visited again a couple days ago for a work gathering. We were there during happy hour which they have $2 tacos as part of their special. I tried the Carne Asada, the Standard and Chicken Tinga tacos. We also shared the street corn, guacamole, and the churros with chocolate on the side. The carne asada, street corn and guacamole was lacking flavor but rest of the food was good. Service was good. They didn't look to busy and we had about 4 people serving our table of 8 so it was confusing to figure out who was our server. The atmosphere was fun and inviting. I am curious to try out some more food so I plan on going back and I'll take some pictures for ya! =)	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	H6HS5pZDrnc4HG7eWYz6nQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

We had the standard, Carne asada, and grilled fish and none of them were particularly amazing. Loved the atmosphere but unfortunately wouldn't be back due to the lackluster food. \n\nAlso, it would be nice if they told you Taco Tuesday doesn't start until 2 pm. I called to ask which tacos were included but they didn't bother to mention the time. Was pretty perturbed to show up at 1:30 to find we had to pay full price.	2	2	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	yAACM20_jx5uDnQ_CyKkHA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
aj1QFKqEAm9anqGBqt_FZA	4	2015-04-02 00:00:00	Joyride makes up for some inconsistency in flavor profiles with a super cool ambience, friendly and capable service, and reasonable pricing.  Some of the tacos we ordered were well-seasoned and flavorful, and others slightly bland - the shrimp could have been fresher.  The nachos were to DIE for, but the side of pinto beans was heavily over salted.  \n\nThe setup is open with a hip and inviting color scheme that speaks to the casual and laid-back vibe.  There is a sizable bar with interesting drinks (aguas frescas) which are all spike-able.  \n\nThe hostess was probably the friendliest person I've ever met and servers were definitely capable and friendly.  A little more work on food consistency and this place would easily earn a 5-star rating.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	AqZ1VgCwCvNVJ1S1g8Bihg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The place is great, whether you are coming here on a date, with friends, or in my case, alone (because you're on a work trip and others are too lame to drive more than a block for dinner). It's such a cute place and open setting so very welcoming. In doors or outdoors, no matter where you sit, you'll love it.\n\nSat at the bar and at the recommendation of the bartender, had one of their agua frescas (citrus) with tequila which was very refreshing and delicious. Ordered 3 tacos (braised beef, fried fish and chicken tinga) which comes w a choice of a side. No other comment except FKN DELICIOUS (the tacos that is)! \n\nI then ordered a spicy cucumber drink which was pretty fantastic. I love that their drinks are refreshing and not heavy just because their alcoholic. \n\nOnly disappointment was the rice which didn't seem to be cooked enough but not a big enough deal that would keep me from coming back to this place!

Aub7EsgQ9C0EP1lyI1h1QA	1	2014-05-12 00:00:00	2 strikes and you are out as far as I'm concerned.\nMy first visit was over a month ago and I met some friends for a Sunday brunch. My boyfriend and I got there early so we sat at the bar and ordered beers. I have to say, the bar staff was awesome! Quick service and very helpful. That was the good part.\nGot to our table and not only was our server apparently having a really bad day, she was extremely slow and not very polite. We had to wait for drinks, wait for food etc.. The table next to us complained about the same server and amazingly enough, the service got faster and much better. The food was okay, but nothing to write home about, but the bartenders were so nice I figured I would give this place another try.\n\nThis past weekend, we went again to celebrate my friends birthday. It was a Saturday night and they were busy, but that is to be expected on a Saturday. We sat outside in the grassy area and they told us we could get drinks there while we waited. Well, we waited and waited and waited and finally the server came over for our drink order. It was the same server I had on my first experience at Joyride. This should have been my first clue that things would not go well, but I figured the first visit was a fluke. So we get our round of drinks and waited......................................waited for an hour and a half and the server never came back for another drink order. She came back to other folks and we tried to flag her down, but nothing. I ended up having to get a manager because by this time none of us were happy. Manager promptly came over and got us a round of drinks on the house, but not before she commented on how many empty glasses were at our table, basically accusing us of having more drinks than what I told her. If she had counted she could have seen that there were 9 glasses and 8 people. The extra glass was from water that I had to go get myself.\nAt any rate, service is horrible, food is okay, but since this is the second time I have been there and the service was horrible both times, I won't be back. My friends said they would not be back either because this is not the first bad experience they have had.	7	0	2	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	1eezhWqK1kQD3Q1TOrdwDw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The customer service and management is awesome. In one particular instance, I screwed up my own order by not realizing it had beans on it. Totally my fault. Not only did the manager replace it, he didn't charge me for it either. These guys understand customer service and how to present an experience.\n\nI'd say my only criticism is not something I can really hold against them, they've very popular so there can be quite a wait sometimes during peak times. We try to visit at off-peak times. But again, I can't begrudge them for their own success, so I'll still give them five stars.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	sJgu7ek2v8lMm-AlKIBDPw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
av_OJ8vhIP2bJ7lBbokDmQ	2	2014-04-25 00:00:00	Last time I was there (a few weeks ago), a random female server delivered our pitcher and one cold glass...even though there were 2 adults at the table. She wasn't our server - I think her name was Kim or something. She dropped the stuff & ran. Had she even stopped for 3 seconds to ask if we needed anything else, she could have gotten the second cold glass that was supposed to come with our beverage order. I approached the bar to get said glass and spoke with a guy that looked managerial and let him know. A male bartender was standing behind the "manager" the whole time we spoke and within seconds of returning to my table, he flagged down "Kim" to tell her what I had said. He was even kind enough to point at our table so she knew exactly who we were. Awesome. \n\nFood was good, as usual.

I had chicken, carnitas and pork adobada... all flavored very well with creative extras like radishes and cilantro and Mexican slaw. My wife had the chicken burrito bowl. Huge serving of scrumptious and creative flavors. The squash and chicken were perfectly cooked. Service was top notch, as we had four different people stop by to help, bring food, refills, etc.\n\nWe will definitely return.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Q01QL9ZOk99FCc6wPeIQcw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

B-ZRR9Zv2Xcr4zogXp0FAQ	5	2015-02-11 00:00:00	Started with the guacamole last night, which was delightful. Lots of flavor and crunchy texture from the onions and cilantro. Ordered a strawberry fresca and it delighted my taste buds. I didn't even feel bad drinking it because it is just pure yummy juice....no artificial colors or flavors...just strawberry goodness over ice! \nFor my entree, I ordered a salad. I can't remember the name now, but I did take a photo to add to my review of how perfect it looked when it arrived. It tasted as good as it looked. I added chicken to it, which was too seasoned for my taste, but the rest of the salad was killer. So many unique flavors combining together that each bite tasted better than the last. The dressing came on the side and I didn't even use it! That should tell you how natural packed the salad was with flavor. This will be my go to salad for sure. I'll update my review next time with the name of it. (Yelper fail) \nThe manager came over to check on us multiple times and was so eager to make sure our experience was on point. One of the most involved, and active upper management people I have come across in all my years of dining out. He really made us feel like we were old friends of his, eating at his personal restaurant. Lots of pride in what he does, and what his restaurant serves. HE is what set my review over the top and puts Joyride at a solid 5. I will also figure out the managers name and update this review with that as well. Clearly I was in some sort of food heaven/coma that gave me amnesia of the specifics of my review. Non the less- go here if you want CLEAN modern Mexican food.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	3PSmslXPps8aBmSA6mk-9w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I've had a lot of carne asadas in my time and never has been so fatty. The reason for the 4  rating is because of the staff. My waitress Dee was awesome and informative and very accommodating.

bbkZojFDzdA-kofZ3omEnA	5	2014-10-12 00:00:00	Quickly becoming one of my favorite joints in downtown Gilbert! Joyride has great food with a great vibe. Trio of tacos is a fantastic deal with diner's choice of ten different tacos. My favorite three are shrimp, fish, and braised beef and, since the side dish comes with, the back beans. I suggest eating at the bar. The bartenders make it a fun experience with their service and making sure the right games are on. In the booth, it's perfect for get togethers! Side note - the old school early 90's hip hop that happened to be playing was the cherry on top. On a final note, to the owner of Joyride, your manager is absolutely fantastic. He is epitome of the Joyride customer experience and his staff follows his lead. My server accidentally forgot my dish and he made sure to come by, apologize, thank me for my understanding and ask what dessert he could bring the table to make up for it. The pudding. The answer is always, "The pudding."	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	7kMfuFh7h8PYbcHrqSyqZg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I had the taco trio and was very impressed, chicken, pork, and grilled fish were all fantastic. The blood orange margarita was mouth watering and at $5 (even on a Saturday afternoon) it was a steal. Our server, Fransisco, was very knowledgable and got us very excited for the food. I enjoyed the large selection of tasty yet dairy free options - as a dairy free individual I find it hard to find a good variety of Mexican food that still tastes good without the cheese. But now I have since they use house made aioli in their yummy sauces! Can't wait to go back and try more heavenly creations!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	x9U5T2_bWJT2npxv5Zdp6Q	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

bFjCR-45SqlY9bFJwA1-Gw	3	2016-01-15 00:00:00	The reason why I am giving only 3 stars is first of all, because every time I go there, we never know who our server is. Throughout our lunch, we have maybe 4 to 5 different persons checking on us, which leads to repeated questions. The second reason is because of the prices, they are a little overpriced, must be because it is Downtown Gilbert, $4.5 for a taco is a bit too much. \nHowever, the atmosphere and the decoration is very nice, really modern and lots of colors. They have a nice little patio. If you go for lunch, ask about their lunch special, $9.75 for 2 tacos and a side (or half a salad)!	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	M-CoiHVChXrRVRDFnV68zw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

This type of eating is a first of its kind, and if you love tacos and want to eat at one of THE COOLEST(meaning reddest, most hip, not referring to temperatures) places in the valley, then stop here. \n\n\nOh. The tacos are amazing as well. I can't remember what the waitress said, but I think it's owned by some famous chef. \n\nSpeaking of waitresses. You'll have multiple ones.

They didn't bring is chips and salsa until we asked, my husbands water glass was dirty. They are overpriced. Did I say they are Overpriced!? Ordered ceviche for 12.95. Surprised at how small the portion was. Ordered guacamole and that too was pricy and the portion small. Usually appetizers are meant for sharing but for those portions and prices I won't order either one again.....the drink my hubs ordered was not refillable. We were not told that prior to ordering... all and all less than stellar experience. Sorry to say we won't be back.

bnp9khfqnnIrrQpDg_98mw	2	2014-10-31 00:00:00	This place is a hotspot for hipsters.  I went there a year ago on a date because she was a big fan of Mexican food, as am I.  She ordered a burrito and I got three tacos: 2 fish and 1 carne asada.  We also got the almond horchata.  \n\nThe food was incredibly forgettable.  It wasn't spicy or flavorful in any way.  The presentation was great but who cares if the food is bland.  We were both very disappointed in the food as well as the horchata.  I got the feeling that this place was so busy creating a hipster-friendly environment that they forgot to worry about their food.  \n\nOverall, the place had a cool look, friendly service, and the prices weren't terrible but I'm never going back simply because the food was not that good.  I'll be hitting up Joe's BBQ across the street if I'm ever in the neighborhood again.	3	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	6yMvpKowpnBqAoH1opUbjw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
boeZ7Ydw7rNdThNb394-xg	2	2014-05-03 00:00:00	Well after a few recommendations and some yelp reviews we decided to try it. Over all a disappointment for all the hype. 50 minute wait. 30 minute wait from the time we ordered appetizer until food arrived...uhm before the appetizer. I had 3 way overpriced "street tacos" crispy fish, shrimp, and shredded beef. Both the fish and shrimp were cold, the beef barely warm...wife's were adequately warm. Over all tacos all kind of tasted the same was my wife's comment. I agreed. Appetizer finally came...ahi tostada (on the house at this point) it was good...but nothing to write home about...was not seasoned at all. It's amazing what a little salt and pepper can do for a dish folks. A double rum and coke set me back 14 dollars wtf? The moes definitely desert? Uhmmm runny and grainy boxed pudding, a clump of sliced banana, Carmel and salted pecans...pecans and Carmel were the best part etc...thrown together...but tasted pretty good...not worth 6 bucks. Our server was pleasant enough but forgetful apparently. Short term memory problems? Lol\n\nAll said and done ? 64 dollars for one app, two entrees, one desert and two drinks. \n\nI don't know what the uber positive reviews are all about I'm thinking you waited a long time and had a few too many by the time your table was ready hence..."everything was so good"...really over priced, under seasoned, poorly executed simple food. Trying to ride on the hipster local and decor  and forgetting that the food and service is the thing. \n\n We decided we will go try it one more time just make sure it wasn't an accident.

Having some churro's with a dark chocolate dipping sauce is also delicious at the end of the meal. \nIt's a very chill, relaxed place to hangout and have lunch or dinner.

Indoor and outdoor seating - with the choice of 2 patios.\n\nChips were good - not burnt or too thick, house salsa was nice with a little smokey flavor and not too spicy for those who are spice-challenged.  I ordered a cucumber mint agua fresca which was really light and refreshing.  Also got the nachos with a little added corn.  The server was right when he told me, "it's like a meal."

We came across this location as we were in the mood for some Mexican food. \nFairly busy at about 3:30 in the afternoon which made it seem to us, like it was a pretty popular hang out for the locals. I'd say the atmosphere is like a retro, chic, cool contemporary concept throughout this restaurant. From the style & theme/ to the menu they offer, it's different ( in a really good way).\nOur server was Breezy, With an adorable flower head band & all: She was pleasant, fun and informative. \nWe first thought there wasn't much to the menu, that was until we tried the food- WOW!!\nHappy Hour was going on-so all draft beers by the pitcher were $5 each! Sweet!\nComplementary chips & salsa made a quick appearance at our table!\nI ordered the Nacho's as my " main meal" ( no meat) but they do offer chicken or steak at an additional charge). I replaced the avocado & sub'd it for guacamole (extra fee). Crispy fried flour tortillas lightly salted & topped with delicious fixings that included a creamy lime aioli- Amazing!\nWe also ordered a burrito called "the beast" and they give the option to deep fry it: "chimichanga style! "Yes please!! It was killer!"\n"Lastly"; three tacos that come out on a silver slotted taco rack. Many varieties of meats to choose from. Ordered the braised beef, baja fish & tinga chicken. ALL were incredible! Accompanied by an orange cucumber salad that is extremely unique!\nA MEMORABLE Dessert: called the "Better than Bettie's, Mexican chocolate brownie plus Cajeta (a creamy warm caramel sauce)  w/ Dulce De Leche ice cream- Deliciously Devine!  \nPresentation of ALL our meals was not only eye appealing, but the taste "tummy tantalizing"!! LOL. \nService  by the staff was above & beyond. Not only was our waitress good we were always followed up by Jacy: professional & very well informed of product & store knowledge.

BUo2_IQu46YiAzblMmDLwg	2	2016-10-25 00:00:00	I don't understand the rave reviews. The food is moderately fresh, but the recipes are weird and the portions are tiny. I don't know if it's because I keep ordering the wrong things (tacos), but after 3 attempts here, my husband and I gave up. It seemed really gringo, and not not-Mexican-but-not-bad gringo like Chipotle, but not-Mexican-but-not-good gringo like Chile's, the chain restaurant. So if you feel like a hipster, expensive, Gilbert edition of On-The-Border because you've too scared to go to Mexico or even just Mesa so you don't know the difference, go for it. It reminded me of the time I went to Nogales and ate at place serving pizza - people get delighted at the idea that they're eating other people's food even when it has nothing even remotely to do with it. If you like decently fresh, authentic Mexican fare, I think you'll be more impressed with the patio than the food.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	c-aI_1if-kL5gU0fUIOsiA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

B_W0UFXocmWKAiBcTjcT9w	5	2015-07-19 00:00:00	This place is incredible. The salsa that was served with the chips was actually spicy, which I have never experienced at any Mexican restaurant ever before. I ordered a Raspberry-Ancho margarita and the veggie enchiladas, both of which were absolutely delicious. I tried some of the carne asada from my friends beast burrito and enjoyed that as well. I wish there was one of these in California - favorite food spot in AZ so far!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	GYh2OrGRWHfAhh4r2I3Mpg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

We had excellent service with numerous servers checking on us throughout the meal. I'm a New Yorker, husband is a Londoner and we really get crazed when the service isn't good and this was not the case!  Service was top notch!\n\nThe tacos were terrific. I  had Grilled Shrimp, Baja Fish and Ahi Tuna and loved them and I'm not even a Mexican food lover.    Hubby had Carne Asada, Shredded Beef and I think Chicken Tinja and he thought everything was delicious. \n\nThe music was great - Cat Stevens to Prince to Sting and not too loud like Federal Pizza.  The interior is a well designed cool urban space.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	LGDG2rhF1fsbcY3iPfmj5w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

There are many other treats to try at this establishment.  The decor is fun, seating in a booth is comfortable with others and the service is always consistently right on.  They will do for you whatever it takes!  You place your order, and it's there in hardly no time at all.  Fresh!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	X3WaaFQoAqZ-w-dWefcb3g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
CCuXjeFeRjzZjZ7-hkY7HQ	4	2016-10-28 00:00:00	Great happy hour spot in Downtown Gilbert. During happy hour (2-6pm), there is a good selection of fish tacos and $5 margaritas. \n\nI've had three types of tacos: The Standard, Carnitas, and Fish. The fish was by far the best; it was crispy and the fish was cooked perfectly. The Standard and Carnitas tacos are decent, but not memorable. I pleasantly surprised at how strong the blood orange margarita as for $5, I expected a watered down one. The churros and chocolate are good as well. Not exactly authentic, but a good spot nonetheless. \n\nOnly real complaint was that they were skimpy with the salsa and guacamole.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	CruXS1miugUWBGqv66Z1Jg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
cdK8uDxV1YbDCRsYB6sy2g	1	2014-07-07 00:00:00	Honestly, I don't understand all the positive reviews this place has. I've been there twice now and both times it was truly the worst customer service I've had at a restaurant/bar in recent memory. \nBoth times we've waited at least 10 minutes after sitting down for anyone to come by and take drink orders, had at least 4 different people serving us through the course of our meal and felt like total inconveniences for the staff. \nThe last time I was there I ordered a vodka cranberry and I kid you not, the waitress said "is that on the menu?" I just stared at her and said, umm.. I'm not sure. I didn't look at the drink menu". A vodka cranberry? Really? \nThe only things I like about joyride are the location and the food is great too. However, with such terrible customer service I'll eat food I like less elsewhere.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	GKoYMLxeH96QUHgC63xBvA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
CeEUxxiAcpi3ruEuQrvnKQ	4	2015-01-09 00:00:00	Taco Tuesdays is where it's at.  $2 for most tacos here after 2pm on Tuesdays (and $5 margaritas!).  I've moved out of Arizona but come back once or twice a year to visit the family.  It's really incredible how downtown Gilbert has expanded and modernized to accommodate so many new businesses.  People actually come here to eat now :o.  It's also awesome to see that the space that Postino and Joyride is in is now finally home to a successful business.\n\nJoyride has delicious Tex-Mex style tacos (my favs so far are the carne asada and the standard), and great service.  The staff is always friendly, and the space is nice and open.  I love how the setup lets you simultaneously eat, watch TV, and take in all that downtown Gilbert has to offer.	2	0	3	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	HbvzphlSrnMtN09Z719e8w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

CGXN7kmsqOcfbDlmy7uBQg	4	2014-07-21 00:00:00	Solid bet for lunch or dinner in the Gilbert area. I live in Arcadia, but grew up in the East valley and have many friends who still live out on the east side. Since most of them have babies now, I am always looking for decent spots in the east valley to meet for lunch, etc. since it's easier for me to travel (no kids) than it is for them. \n\nJoyride is similar to several other iterations of the same sort of upscale Mexican/taco concept, like Sol or Barrio Queen. They have a nice deal where if you order three tacos they give you a free side, which rounds out the meal. \n\nI had the veggie, shrimp and ahi tacos (photo posted) and they were all good. I liked the shrimp and veggie the best, might switch out the ahi for a different option on the next visit. The prices were reasonable for this sort of restaurant  and my friend was pleased that they had decently priced kids menu. \n\nAll in all, we enjoyed our visit and I would certainly visit agin or hit up the Phoenix branch.	2	1	2	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	y_eAE6_gPJw2m-Ao7iHKPQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

My wife had the horchata with a splash of amaretto added and it was tasty. I tried both of their margaritas, the blood orange and the house and they were very good. My wife had the enchilata's and she enjoyed them.\n\nMy only complaint to this place is the drink prices of their speciality drinks. When it's not happy hour they are $10 each. If you like to have a few drinks, it would be best to visit here during happy hour which offers some great prices for drinks along with food. We will be back and plan on trying their happy hour food/drinks next.\n\nForgot to mention, we were able to get seated right away, service was excellent and food came out really fast.

CkJxeHfvYRpo1CHkfesG7Q	5	2015-05-02 00:00:00	What a great dinner! First, let me start with the salsa and chips, which is the first thing they bring you. Nice heat, little sweetness and acidity. Really some good salsa. Actually, I was a little bummed I didn't try it before getting appetizers since I would have tried some of the others.\n\nFor apps we had the shrimp ceviche and mas queso. LOVED the ceviche. It was so stinking good. Little jicama in there with a pico type mix. The queso was good. I'm not a huge cheese fan but my husband really liked it. \n\nEntrees, I had 3 tacos from the happy hour menu. Totally suggest doing that since they are $2 each. Ordered the traditional, pork adoba and carne asada. There was a mix up and I got the fish instead of the traditional but that was fine with me since I was debating that one. Fish and carne were fantastic. Adoba wasn't quite what I was expecting. It was okay but not near as good as the other two. Husband had a burrito with eggs and beef in it. Name escapes me but he really like it.\n\nOver all, awesome meal. Best of all, whole thing cost us $33. Can't really beat a nice meal out for that price.	0	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	p9Zr9RYfe3_KvMzJy0u76w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The ambiance is laid back, but not so laid back you don't see your server for 20 minutes at a time (HUGE pet peeve for me). We eat there more than we probably should admit, but we love it! \n\nIf I had to find a negative it would be that the chips aren't endless...  just give us the chips	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	_3U-6rcoEYb83aDEwAA8yw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

If you ask really nicely they might serve you appetizers there too if you just want a snack and some drinks.  The wait gets to be pretty long on Fridays and Saturdays, so you want to make a reservation if possible.  We had done happy hour before coming here so we ended up not being hungry enough to get any food - I'll have to try that next time.  I love the color scheme here - bright and happy.  Casual to casual-dressy - perfect for jeans and a cute top or a sun dress.

The group was taken care of very well. Our glasses were always full and they came around a lot to check in on us. \n\nThe food was also very good. I tried the carne asada, crispy fish, chicken Tiga, and Mexican rice. My favorite taco was the carne asada. The other two were good, but this one beat the others out. \n\nSome other people in our group tried the nachos (which were huge), chicken bowls, and burritos. I heard from them all that it was a pretty great place. \n\nIs it authentic Mexican food? Probably not. None the less, it was very good food.

They both looked amazing when they were brought up to the table so I can tell we have a good professional Chef in the kitchen but when we went to eating the food there was no flavor what so ever. The only flavor was the green sauce covering it. \nThe people seemed nice but there was one waiter that was very rude and made a mess as he kept filling our waters. not professional at all. \nAs I said if you are a Latino looking for some real Mexican food then this is the wrong place for you.	1	1	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	VFJIGG6MUgnx-2U3VyL9rA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I had one happy hour drink and the waitress asked my friend if she wanted another round and walked off without asking me, my drink was empty. Then 30 minutes pass and the server said "oh did you not get your margarita" to my friend. So we both asked for a drink then about another 30 minutes go by before we got our drinks and her response was "I'll make sure you don't get charged double for your drinks". Well I sure hope not! Then about 45 minutes to an hour pass with ZERO service, and another server stopped by asking if we were ready for our check. She cashed us out, we have no idea what happened to our server. One of the worst experiences I've ever had! Other people have told me that the service has become terrible there, but we gave it a shot anyways, bad idea!

dHDUviVOtK1yaRk5bdjixw	2	2014-11-12 00:00:00	Don't buy into to the hype! Everything we tried was bad. I did the 3 tacos with a free side. I tried the carne asada, crispy fish, and carnitas taco with a side of pinto beans. My wife had the Beast burrito. The crispy fish was over cooked. The fish was dry and the batter coating was about 2 seconds shy of being burnt. The carne asada was not edible. It was literally nothing but 2 strips of fat and gristle. The carnitas taco was actually braised beef because they brought the wrong one. That was the only decent taco, however.  My wife had the same issue with fat and gristle in her burrito but she did have some edible pieces of meat in there.  The burrito was very wet and soggy, not appealing attributes of a burrito. Not only was the food bad, the tacos were very small for the price. You can go to almost any other restaurant and get a taco twice the size and twice the flavor for half the cost.  There was a comment card left with the bill so my wife filled it out and listed a few of the points listed above.  As we were leaving, my wife stopped by the restroom and I waited outside.  The manager then came out of the restaurant and confronted me with an almost hostile manner said, "so you didn't like the food, huh?"  I explained many of the reasons.  He made excuses and gave me 2 coupons for 3 free tacos each. I already tried half their taco menu and was not impressed with any of them so I doubt we will be back.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	PUt3imNFCWg-GzVURVKfvg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Places don't just do that anymore. Then we went up to the bar and the bar tenders are just as personable, when we asked for a shot that they didn't have the stuff for they improvised, and introduced us to a new shots we have never had and ended up being amazing.

DHlrBEIfhdgySwFRbHfjEQ	2	2015-03-16 00:00:00	Went to Joyride for dinner last night to give it a shot for the first time. They have a simple menu but pricey for Mexican food; they will nickel and dime you to death on sides that you would ordinarily get with your meal at other Mexican food restaurants, so make sure you ask before you get your bill. My $12 burrito was nothing to write home about and the "refills" for their aguas frescas (no alcohol) are not free (it would be nice to know ahead of time). What you are really paying for is the ambiance, the décor, loud music, their indoor outdoor concept and their cool hip staff which provide good service. I felt fleeced when we received our bill for almost $50 for 3 tacos a burrito, churros and our $10 agua fresca.  In my humble opinion, if you still care about the food and want great value for your hard earned money Nando's Café is still a hidden gem in Gilbert.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	fT4dXjrNi58irKOgRi6wBQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The staff was friendly upon arrival, and we were sat immediately. The decorations were very modern and I noticed that the left wall could open up to include the patio as part of the restaurant, which was pretty cool. Seems to be a great spot for lunch especially during nice weather. The salsa was different and I remember it having a bit of spice to it, which I love. I only wish the portion size could have been bigger! Not that we left hungry. We ordered the nachos as an appetizer and almost filled up on that. They were very good and fresh. I'm not sure what it was, but the green salsa on top tied everything together for me although all of the ingredients had a lot of flavor. We also ordered a fish taco al a carte and the Bandit Taco platter. Both were very good, although nothing in particular is jumping to my memory. Overall, very good experience I will definitely be back to try the lunch menu!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	C2t8xBvuuWOeeoOpNlV8Iw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
dJ1Es4IT07uDUpIn7xENkA	4	2013-10-19 00:00:00	We went there for a couple's date and sat at a lovely table on the patio. It faced Gilbert Road, adjacent to Postinos and it was very loud. However, the music slightly drowned out the street sounds. The service overall was ok. Our waitress came around to check on us periodically but I understood as it was a busy Friday evening.  We were first served chips and salsa.  You could tell the chips were made fresh and the salsa was good not great. I ordered the cucumber mint tequila drink. So refreshing, but paying $8 for this it was a little weak. My friend got the almond horchata with frangelico. It was good  not too sweet, but I felt it didn't have enough horchata flavour. For an appetizer, we ordered the queso dip. I'd give it a 3.5 out of 5. Now on to the tacos...we were all very confused by what they meant by "family style". All it means is they come on taco trays not in any sort of order. You get one taco $3 to 4. The best at our table was the shrimp, braised beef, chicken tinga and Baja. We also had two sides...black beans (So very good, probably cooked with ham as they were very rich) and rice (didn't finish it as it was dry and slightly bland). Our table agreed we would come back perhaps during their happy hour,  which is from open to 5 everyday, as the bill racked up quickly from everything being al la carte. At the end of the dinner, we had a chance to meet the manager and he was delighted to know we found it because of yelp. So next time I have my eyes set on one of their tamales. Yum! We will see how that goes...	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	SmUqmuFnRfNmgXEc_ur_QQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

We frequently stroll downtown Gilbert,  but we usually visit Postinos or other restaurant's in The area. We had our dog with us today and we were looking for a dog friendly place to stop and have a drink or two. So glad we stoped here the service was far beyond excellent. We will definitely return. Every single staff member made us feel like we were part of the FAM! GREAT JOB!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	XOdq2imlE0e2d1vwszWrvw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

That might be because their happy hour starts at 11 AM.  I did not decline the $5 house margarita when my server offered it to me! It was served on the rocks and had just the right balance of sweet triple sec and tart fresh lime juice.  You can upgrade to Don Julio for $2 more, which I did on my second margarita just to see if I could tell the difference.  I could! Try conducting your own taste test if you're there for happy hour.  My drinks came with a basket of chips and fresh, chunky salsa that was on the mild side.\n\nThe tacos were packed with fillings, and very good, but didn't necessarily stand out from the all the other street tacos out there.  I chose the Standard, which featured chicken and avocado, and the carnitas, topped with avocado and tomatillo sauce.  You can get a free side dish if you order three tacos, but I found that two tacos was plenty to eat.   \n\nService was friendly and helpful.  Overall, I'd come back to Joyride to try some of their other tacos.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	XKxi1gkxmb9kqF_HXHe4aA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
dL7Gtiv4sTIRosUn0POsVg	3	2017-05-13 00:00:00	Good food and atmosphere. Server, Bailey, was one of the worst servers I have had while eating out. Never felt welcome from the start, it was our first time at this restaurant. Difficult for our server to even crack a smile, she actually seemed irritated when I asked for a refill on the salsa; barely any in the dish the first time around. Chips that were brought to the table were completely broken. After the first 10 chips, we nibbled on quarter sized corn chips until the meals arrived. Do we want another round of drinks? Hell, no! The check please. So, she takes the basket full of broken chips that we were still nibbling on, while waiting to pay. A sad experience. Friendlier and more courteous service at In N Out Burger, but they don't serve drinks and tacos. \n\nFollowup: The general manager did reach out through Yelp to make it right and take corrective action. I declined contact, my key points are covered above.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	zymkZqXSr8ak-CeUIfjWBg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The drinks very tasty and flavorful.  We ate at the bar and let me tell you we had the\nMost fun in a long time.   Very friendly setting the servers who are behind the bar you can tell like being there.   Gives you a sense of I'm glad I came to eat tacos at joyride.  We liked it so much we would have no problem taking out of town guests here.   This one is a winner.

Noo regrets! the meat was flavorful and very delicious!\n\nIf you happen to be in the mood for a drink or two, try their 'Prickly Pear Margarita'...super tasty! it compliments anything on the menu.\n\nAs far as service, Tony was amazing. His taste buds were on point, everything he recommended was delicious! He was also very attentive and friendly as well as everyone else who serviced us.	1	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	8KDcXMc4hEzkxLjBLIXNBA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The atmosphere is cool and the staff were completely helpful and friendly. We arrived for an early dinner and were initially blown away by the street corn and the ceviche. They were so fresh and damn near a complete meal all by themselves. But I was not to be cheated out of some meat (and no, fish does not qualify as meat).\n\nFor our entrees we ordered the Beast burrito along with three street tacos (carnitas, short rib and carne asada). The carne asada was flavorful and moist - so unlike the tire rubber you get from other places. The carnitas and short rib were also awesome. We rounded out the meal (and ourselves) with vanilla pudding and I almost had tears in my eye it was so freakin good.\n\nWe shoveled everything back and doused it with some Cucumber Serrano mixed drinks along with a Corona - the coolest looking 32 ounce beer bottle I have laid eyes on in some time. So tasty. \n\nThe patio looks amazing (although I can't say that I even contemplated braving the 112 degree temperatures when we were there) and should be stellar when the weather creeps down. Will definitely be back!	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	P7jyYvWRK88nxZWUPrz89Q	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
dQ4N9chOFMfJToqgbn0phQ	4	2015-10-16 00:00:00	UPDATE: I had the Carne Asada Taco again.  Very good.  The cheese y mas was absolutely yummy.  The chips were on the burned side and hard, mixed in with a fresh batch.  We asked the staff and the whole batch was that way.  :(  I feel at that point, they should have made a fresh batch and not mixed the bad batch in them.  I got a watermelon Margareta.   If you like Solbe Life water w/tequila, you would like this drink. ;)  very light tasting.  I will give them a third\n try because some of this was very pleasant and yummy and I am hoping it was an off day.....plus the staff is really awesome.\n\n\n\n\nI had a Carne Asada Taco and had them add cheese. They forgot that and I had to send it back. :(   It was a good taco.   My friend had the chicken enchilada with 2 different sauces.  I took a bite and I liked the green sauce better.  They were both delicious but it was just preference. \n\nI had so many people coming to my table, it was confusing who my actual "waitress" was.  I just grabbed the nearest staff member when I needed something.  They have a nice happy hour but the drinks were on the weak side.  I would like that for my drinks, lol but my friend did not.  Again, that would be preferences.  ;)  \n\nThe ambience is casual and friendly.  I liked the staff.  I would definitely go again.	6	0	4	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Y8RDlqlDgOL0n-tjFvWdaw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

dRzykNPw6YLBoZkrHq_Bug	4	2015-02-16 00:00:00	We came for a friend's birthday lunch, her second time and my first. It was pretty crowded although it sounds like that's pretty typical for Joyride.\n\nWe had a 45 minute wait that went by quickly thanks to the fresh squeezed margaritas and craft beer. My favorite drink was the cucumber margatprita with serranos and green tea syrup. \n\nBut the star of the menu was the guacamole...and I am a picky guacamole consumer. It was freshly made with chunks of avocado, sprigs of cilantro, and a few diced jalapeños. We ordered two batches. I also enjoyed the neet, pomegranate, green leaf salad and my friends were gushing over their shrimp tacos.\n\nAll of these plus the fast, pleasant,and attentive service and attractive decor make Joyride a hit. We can't wait to come back on our next trip to the Valley; what an excellent addition to downtown Gilbert.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	nXUxCSgBTTQ20QCvgW61hg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Extremely slow serving, I had 5-10 people walk by us before WE had to ask to get a drink. Then 15-20min later, WE had to ask about getting a food order in. We sat at the bar.\nThe place itself is a great looker, but the service is what's going to keep me away. Will not try this over priced taco house again.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	uvrqKIGK2VoFLN5p5V888Q	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Service was great, they seemed to work as a team, it did take my burrito a little longer than expected (carne asada & other deliciousness). I just got the kiddo a said of beans (they were different, topped with some sort of oil??), had I realized they were $4 I would have gone with the $5 kids meal but I didn't think he would eat it all (entree, side & drink - smoking kids meal deal!).

Ordered drinks while we waited for a table. Didn't get the drinks until about 5-10 mins before our table was ready. We still weren't complaining we knew they were busy. Our server was too busy to serve us so someone else helped us. It took about 30 mins to get our order in and 30 mins until we received our food. The shrimp tacos we ordered were burned to the point where you had a lingering after taste of charcoal in your mouth. They gave us another taco for free but the food was not as good as reviews made it sound. Maybe it was not a good night for them but we waited forever to get food that a hole in the wall place could have served in a fraction of the time. The staff was very friendly but the food was not good in my opinion. Very unlikely I will go there again.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	nfT0ARheRLp7ZNdMwi7SyA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I've been here several times in the past, it's a decently sized restaurant bar with outdoor seating.\n\nHappy hour is something like 2-5/6 on weekdays and gets you 5$ margaritas that are pretty tasty and strong, or a pitcher of beer for 5$, as well as 2$ tacos. \n\nThe tacos are okay, being the chef that I am I feel like they lack flavor, although the chips and salsa are on point... but try not to munch on them too fast because the severs inconsistently charge you 2$ for a refill.\n\nI enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant, although it was kind of confusing being served by two people who kept asking the same questions, and provided two bills. \n\n\n\nI have to be a critic and add that I've had better food like Nandos that is great overall,or similarly priced, but being that this place is located in such a cool area I would be inclined to return again soon.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	_fye9jygzVDx2nN5C3W3zQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
e3m6noyEFoKU8v0su4-qvA	3	2014-10-07 00:00:00	Came with with my girlfriend and our dogs, as there is a large dog-friendly patio.  I loved the location & look of this fun, festive, trendy lil spot. The music was great, lots of Dr. Dre, Snoop, & a whole bunch of other 1990's rap that made me feel like it was 1996 all over again.  \n\nNow, the food itself was not super impressive, but there were some items that really stood out.  Personally, I would suggest the chilled ahi-stack,  the cheese y mas, and the Mexican street corn.  As far as drinks, I would go with the frangelico horchata as opposed to a margarita. Pretty good service too.  I'll update review once I try a few more dinner dishes.	4	2	4	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	04J_q_VhSBItxNiEAN-gkA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I ordered 3 tacos and the cucumber orange salad (if you order 3 tacos it comes with a side). I ordered 1 shrimp, 1 carne asada, and 1 pork adobada taco. I also ordered a $5 cucumber serrano margarita and 1 $5 spiked almond horchata :).  The margarita was not as refreshing as I imagined it would be, and the portion seemed a little small, but I really loved the horchata, which I spiked with vanilla vodka. The tacos were tasty, but I think I prefer the tacos at la santisima. The cucumber salad didn't taste very orange-y to me and I'm not sure why they are more expensive than the other sides. That said, I much prefer the service here and will be coming back to try more tacos.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	jSs2q7mM_L9ZdBxgJ_gV7g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

EcZcuSWR-y_FzeyL-5xlmA	5	2013-07-07 00:00:00	After reading some of the reviews I wasn't sure I wanted to visit this place until it settled down a bit.  That gave way to "what the hell, let's give it a shot."  Girlfriend and I did the drive out to Gilbert, walked in, and grabbed a couple seats at the bar since there was a long wait for a table.  We both tend to grade places like this based on their fish and/or carnitas tacos.  I'm an equal opportunity omnivore (the scale tells me this), so my requirements are little less strict, but she's the ultimate snob when it comes to fish and carnitas tacos.  After getting drinks, chips, and salsa, we ordered crispy fish tacos.  They arrive, we dig in, and after a few bites she said they're some of the best she has had.  That's very high praise from someone who will knock off points for anything that isn't "right." \n\nAfter finishing the fish tacos, we ordered an assortment of salsa and while the charred habanero salsa is listed as "melt your face" hot, it's not quite there but more than hot enough to make you work up a sweat.  Maybe that's just a warning for tourists. :)  The habanero, tomatillo, and chile de arbol salsas were all very good.  Next up:  carnitas tacos.  Like the fish tacos, they were exceptional.  A little drippy, but that's far better than some of the dried out excuses for carnitas you'd find at lesser taco joints.  \n\nSure, you can get the same (in name only) food at a taco shop down the road for half the price, but you also get half the quality.  The prices aren't out of line for what you get.  \n\nWe're probably going back tomorrow to try other menu items now that we have a baseline.  Yeah, it's that good.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	j6kOyiPha9HG-udThFE5Vg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
ed840cNAnlYjrKhqSsKW5w	4	2014-07-12 00:00:00	I think as far as the food is concerned, Joyride deserves 5 stars. I had two of the carne asada tacos and one of the carnitas tacos. The carne asada tacos were among the best I've had. So tasty, such flavor, wow!  The carnitas taco was also super good. I ordered a side of the habanero salsa and while it was not as hot as I was hoping for, it had a lot of flavor to go along with the heat. Don't let the fact that it contains habanero peppers scare you off, it is more than doable, even for the chili challenged. Maybe they should make a ghost pepper salsa.  My wife ordered a pair of the baja fish tacos. I must admit, even though I'm usually not a seafood person, the bite I had was\nalso tasty. If you like horchata, do yourself a favor and try their "spiked" horchata with amaretto. It's really good and the fresh ground cinnamon on top was a nice touch.  Overall, I'm looking forward to hitting this place again. I wish I could say that I would sample more of their offerings but I'm not one that likes to "go off the reservation" once I find something I like.  Only reason I didn't give a full 5 stars is because, we sat at the bar, and the staff was a lil slow in responding to empty drink glasses. Yes, a lil room for improvement but not a big deal.

EiH6OqGQITm7TyL4L8Gjxg	3	2014-02-12 00:00:00	I like Joyride, but please understand you must manage your expectations. This is not the place to get authentic Mexican food for cheap. I mean, C'mon, this is Gilbert. You should go to Carolina's in Central Phoenix if you want a delicious tostada for pennies. You go to Joyride for the hip atmosphere, the funky decor, and the spiked agua frescas. \n\nThat being said, I love their Mix Tape salad (to which I like to add carne asada), and their almond horchata. The chips and salsa are good too, but I would pass on the Mexican corn. I think $5 for an ear of corn (no matter how much you dress it up) is ridiculous. I tried it, and it was okay.	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	8cf5U6sCwYPKDKyLfSi6Ig	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I think the food is a TAD bit over priced as far as the quantity you get. Service and ambience is what this place is known for I think. I'm one of those super tall guys that can eat a lot. They don't have a crazy entre that fills me up completely. I go for what they have to offer though: The Beast Burrito. The 1st batch of Chips and Salsa are complimentary (they used to be all free though :/)	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	rGm8NKrjhoqKRx5eJc_3qA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Well, HELLO GILBERT!  It has totally redone the downtown strip and it is lined with great restaurants like JOYRIDE.  My first time in there, TayK took such good care of me!  Great recommendations, suggestions for next time, and more.. She was totally passionate about her craft and it made me want to try everything on the menu.  I had tacos (of course) and the Corn... AMAZING.  Oh, and the blood orange margarita was absolutely perfect!  I will be going back for Taco Tuesday!!!

Food way over priced for what it is and was really bad.. carne asada ??wtf horrible. Cheap beer is the only good thing that's if you can get a drink  from the snooty want to be server/ bartenders... I know what ppl have been saying in the Gilbert community and its obvious there is no way this is a four star joint...

The wait to get in could be twice as long and still enjoyable because of the outdoor seating/setting.\n\nHowever, the service was not good at all.  Our waitress was rude and kept explaining that they didn't know how to handle a crowd this big.  It was Saturday afternoon and busy but not overwhelmingly so in my opinion.\n\nMy sister asked if she could order a bowl of fruit for one of the kids, and the waitress said no that's not allowed because it has to go through the kitchen.  Um, my sister didn't ask to get it for free or to get it before the rest of the meal.\n\nWe asked for chips and salsa and the reply was Seriously you'll get them when they're ready.  Lots of people want them and they aren't ready yet.  Again...um...it was a question.  We weren't even irritated to have not gotten them yet.  It was a request.\n\nAnd, the night went on with a defensive waitress who was either new, in over her head or recently screamed at by too many other tables that her reflex was always defensive.\n\nBy the end of the night she seemed to realize she needed to warm up to my sister if she wanted a tip because she was finally somewhat friendly when she dropped off the bill.\n\nHad the waitress been friendly and the noise level a bit lower overall, I would definitely give this place more stars.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	XBHRVCAKKgPVdG_cx7YQTw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I was most impressed with how kid friendly they were. Our kids food came on kid friendly plates - nice hard plastic red ones. I have never seen this before at restaurant. The kids food was also very good. Sometimes when you order kid menu items, you can tell they are frozen, or no effort is put into it. Not here. They made their kid food with the same quality as the adult food. This is the part that impressed me most. Our adult food was also amazing. We will be returning customers.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	q2lh_2OL_FWB-GW55qLerg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I don't trust a person who tries the joyride horchata and doesn't like it. The tacos are unbelievably tasty. Literally, doesn't matter which one you get. Orgasm in your mouth. Make sure you get the habanero salsa also if you are a spicy fan. It does spicy salsa justice, and then some.

etS2aZvDEwApuJUP-vpfSQ	4	2013-08-09 00:00:00	My first time here, we showed up with a group of 12 people on a Saturday night and almost got laughed out of the place but all with a great sense of humor. They set up a place for us outside, which was mighty kind of them, and we had a wonderful evening.\nI hate to give a review based on one evening and I definitely plan to come back soon and really experience the place.\nFrom a "first look" perspective-the food is fresh and interesting-loved the complimentary smoky salsa-I had bites of several kinds of tacos and enjoyed all of them. The Blood Orange Margarita is tasty but like others have commented-it's a wee bit of drink for the price. \nI get the concept and I love it-fabulous ambience-fresh ingredients-unusual flavor profiles, clearly not Rubios-this is a destination place. But, that being said, Arizonians are used to great Mexican that doesn't bust the wallet. \nI'll be back for a second look!	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	n-YoyJx2_hXs1j9jb1bkrw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
EXTIGLFaw25Y08ridDz7FQ	4	2015-02-10 00:00:00	A really great taco place! I went here with my family a week or two ago. The atmosphere is nice and casual, but it's still okay to wear a cute dress or a nice shirt.\n\nThey have good happy hour deals! My family mostly ordered from this because we wanted to try the tacos. We weren't let down! I got the standard (signature?) taco which was delicious! Be prepared for a little bit of a messy meal though. Don't wear your best outfit in case you drop, drip, or spill. \n\nMy only complaint (if you can even call it that!) is that the waiters/waitresses all wear regular nice clothes, so if you have questions, you must memorize the face. You might mistake a twenty something for one of the workers! But otherwise very good service and very good fresh food! A fun place to try with your friends or family.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	7epEyqj5mzpQTbSflXl2vA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
EXyDmyx0LG8e0a51OmQq3g	3	2013-10-04 00:00:00	Very hip place to be. I love the decor, the music, and just the general ambiance. \n\nWe seemed to be served by all the servers, who were all friendly. They would all basically come up to us, and ask us how we were doing, and if we had ordered yet. Not sure if they were doing this on purpose, or if they were really disorganized that night.\n\nOrdered the carne asada taco, crispy fish, ahi tuna, and braised beef. I thought 3.5+ for 1 taco was expensive, but surprisingly they were pretty beefy tacos. 3 will leave you satisfied/full. They were all delicious and the salsa is quite spicy. My only disappoint is that half of the tacos came out cold, which gives you a harder tortilla and cold meat. They were still good, but could have been better.\n\nAlso ordered churros with chocolate salsa. They were alright, a little doughy, and not thin and crispy enough to my liking.\n\n\n3/5 Would eat here on a rare occasion.	2	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	paI1g754aHdEMEbhLy3Yyw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The service was just as bad as the food, you will dehydrate waiting for something to drink but don't order ice-tea unless you like fufu fruity flavors. When it finely did come I ask why he did not tell me that's the only flavor they serve? I was told no one has ever questioned it before WOW I guess it not questioned because your so thirsty by time it comes you will drink anything??? However my water did come out just in time for my ice cold food.. They get the 1 star from me for nothing but the atmosphere.

EyX3WFuiZqCnpAWpz3i74A	2	2014-04-29 00:00:00	I have eaten here before and at the Central Phoenix location and was a little surprised how rude the staff were.\n\nMy friends and I went in Friday night for drinks and appetizers and asked to be seated outside. She took us to a far corner table off by ourselves on the front patio that was covered in dirt. We then asked to move inside and she shoved us in the very corner booth by the kitchen where we were almost hidden from the entire restaurant when there were plenty of other booths and tables open. \n\nOur actual server was very nice but it honestly took incredibly long to simply get a drink refill on our water, chips and salsa. They were not that busy, it just seemed due to the seating location we were so hidden and off by ourselves he kept forgetting about us. \n\nAfter we finished the food the plan was to hang out and order a few drinks until we decided where else to go. Another server came over immediatley and dropped the bill. He then came back three or four times to check and see if we had placed the cards in there yet. I dont get why servers do this. IT IS SO RUDE. We werent in a hurry, they werent busy at all, we werent bothering anyone but yet they made us feel like we were a complete burden by being there. Ordering $7.00 drinks x4 and food and minding our own business I wouldnt think to be a hassle of a table. \n\nIm only giving them two stars for the food because thats been on point every time I have been there. I used to work for this company when it was jointly owned with the folks from Chelseas Kitchen.. I remember first hand how seriously customer satisfaction was taken while employed with them and am sad to say, they are not carrying on that same mindset to this new concept.	2	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	_0UXptnf1DtCqqYByMBS0Q	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

f3mpe9rCgpo07I9le1a9Dg	5	2013-07-09 00:00:00	Cool place - great name!  I've been there a few times and had a great experience on both.  The service was very good the second time likely due to the manager? who gladly rolled up her sleeves and helped out with everything.  I spent more than a decade in the restaurant biz and I really like the way she runs the floor and talks with guests.  Yeah OK and she's cute too!  :)\n\nThe first time I just drank at the bar and service is always top notch with Chris who I have seen at a few other places in the valley.  He is a professional bartender for sure.\n\nI like the décor and love the fact that they planted desert cactus and succulents outside rather than the typical landscape mix in AZ.  Nice job to the designer there.  The art and materials inside are also pretty cool.\n\nI'm tempted to drop a star because the food is a little pricey as mentioned in some of the other reviews and the chips and salsa are average and could use some work.  I'd also like to see more awareness of specials which we had to discover.  \n\nThe place is busy so be careful about showing up with a big party.	3	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	BEzBsvPwq8ixf_JLdvqLBg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
f5jaibRKw_4xt082u8KK7Q	3	2015-04-12 00:00:00	Service is great, no denying that but the food is so mediocre I cringed while eating my tacos, which is their supposed specialty. I will say though, their tortillas are fresh and taste great with a good texture as they don't get soggy and blow out the bottom. Anyway, I had the fish taco, pork adobaba, and carnitas. The fish to batter ratio was a little weak and the batter seemed to take up more space in the shell than the fish itself and the taste didn't meet my expectation of freshness. The adobaba and carnitas could've been the same taco as far as I was concerned. They were probably the same meat, which had the texture of pulled pork, but the adobaba had a sauce that resembled in look and taste as a failed attempt at tex mex BBQ sauce (although tex-mex is a failed attempt at cuisine, imho). I wasn't a fan as you might imagine. My friend ordered vegetable enchiladas and they were much better than I was expecting, decent red and green enchilada sauce, oaxacan cheese and a nice array of vegetables. Margaritas are good, $5 pitchers of beer before 5:00 everyday, free chips and salsa great service just lacking in the authenticity or even just a little flare in the food department. Probably won't go back. In fact, So cal tacos across the street is twice as good I'd say.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	8Acb6wUNaaA9NbKnehfmYA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The interior looks like a scrapbook with bright patterns on the walls. \n\nAs for the food, each table is served up a dish of awesome salsa and chips as they are seated.  The tacos are about 4 dollars each.  Today I tried the Ahi tuna and the grilled fish.  Both had good flavors and were very unique, however, the Ahi was a little sweet and the grilled fish lacked a bit of a kick.  My friend said taco with cotija was also very good, and I plan to try it the next time a go. Two tacos was a bit small, so I'd recommend ordering a bit more, unless you plan on getting dessert (which I did of course).  \n\nFor dessert, I was craving chocolate, so I ordered the churros con chocolate.  For $6 I would say that the dessert was unimpressive.  The churros were coated in cinnamon and sugar, which really overpower the chocolate (which was also too thick and not heated enough to be a smooth dip).	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	xGI-eYLBRkTcrZZGHmpdFA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

fGEaxwiajVQ2prcmLlGvow	4	2013-06-06 00:00:00	I never like to review a restaurant that opened just 24 hours ago, but I'll make an exception for Joyride. Upwards Projects has this restaurant thing down pat! I met my husband here at 10pm expecting it still to be busy, but there was tons of seating available both inside and outside underneath lanterns hung on a large tree.\n\nI love the decor and ambience. There is lots of fun decorations and bright colors that work well together without being garish. The big U-shaped bar area is fantastic with cushioned, velvety barstools. We were seated at a table near the bussing, but next time, I think the bar area would be the best place, if only for better service.Our waitress wasn't particularly bad, but she didn't check up on us enough. She walked by a few times with a smile, but never stopped to see if we wanted another drink. We always want another drink! Like we often have to do at Postino next door, we started placing orders with the friendly food runners.\n\nThe food and drinks lived up to my expectations and then some. I got a veggie torta filled with squash, mushrooms, corn and avocado. I couldn't taste much of the "white magic" (the lime aioli), but the pickled jalapenos on the side really punched up the flavor. The telera bread was sweet which paired well with the spice and smokiness of the veggies. My husband said his carne asada burrito was ok. I loved the red salsa that came on the side. The complimentary chips are excellent, crispy and substantial. They come with a green salsa that's pretty good and is different than the typical tomatillo-based salsa verde.\n\nI really wanted to try a dessert (and salad, street corn, guacamole, etc), but the torta and two excellent cocktails left no room. I got the almond horchata with frangelico and the Mazatlan Mule. The horchata was basically dessert and went down very easy like the other cocktails. My husband got a blood orange margarita made with the standard Sauza tequila, and it was much better than any margarita I've had in a long time. Like their sister restaurant Windsor, I don't think you can go wrong with the cocktail menu.	3	0	3	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	pu_AQig2fw40PshvtgONPQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

We ordered various street tacos and they were okay but not really memorable.  Our daughter ordered cheese enchiladas and the cheese inside was completely burnt.  She really couldn't eat them.  The margaritas were pretty good and for a good price at happy hour.  With so many options now in DT Gilbert, I'm not sure if I'd return; however, you should give them a try if you're in the mood for tacos and margaritas.  The service was great and the atmosphere is really inviting.	13	4	9	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	c7KRpENpwni-RfjRNrYfRA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

FyhLCtoABxy9SsOOMD9Eug	5	2015-03-01 00:00:00	I have had a lot of Mexican food over the years, some good and some not so good. The Joyride ranks up there with some of the best. Having had the 3 taco combo I choose the "Standard, Baja Fish & Pork." While the Standard and Baja were out of this world the pork was just ok, not my fav at this time. Will need to try it again. The deserts, while only 3 choices available, we choose 2 of the 3 and they were an "oral orgasm." The service exceptional, the ambiance trey KOOL and the food the BEST! I'll be BACK!! ;~)}	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	2XfJYK8Dr4Oo9uMIoPE44A	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
FZIw55sFQmqs4n997YyN4g	2	2015-08-30 00:00:00	So disappointed....Been to the location in Phoenix and it was so great, everything from the staff to the food, not here in Gilbert.  Went in late last night about 10:40pm the posted hours are open until 12am so figured we had plenty of time.  We were greeted and sat immediately. While we were given water and had drink order taken at 1045 pm we were told it was last call for the kitchen and to hurry and order. We ordered Guacamole, and each ordered 2 tacos, we also requested pico since the salsa that came with the complimentary chips were too spicy for our taste.  The pico was awful it came out warm and tasted off but since we placed the order we have not seen our server, he was cleaning and getting ready for closing, plus it wasn't busy. The tacos were good but that's really all I can say.  Had I never been before it would be my last, its my last time at this location, I may try Phoenix again but not anytime soon.	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	eU77PxGTK58WVRWoXULlEw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Other wise your paying a lot for a little bit of food.\n\nUPDATING MY REVIEW:\n\nWe have gone back a couple of times since this review and me and my husband really enjoy sitting up at the bar, watching a game and munching on that delicious bowl of chips and salsa.  The staff is super friendly and is starting to become one of our favorites downtown. But still we try to only go at happy hour, otherwise its really pricey.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	XKil_EsdG8hVuRlJOvCsEg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Well they never brought it back. I asked multiple severs to return my drink but went without almost my entire dinner, and they still charged me for it! Not to mention the tacos are overpriced.

They were kind of sweet.

GEvHmgH8VdKeXlnVJHur_g	4	2014-01-12 00:00:00	The food here is great- the crispy fish tacos are awesome, as are all the other tacos we've tried. The meat is the farthest thing from dry and is super flavorful. The churros dessert is insanely delicious too!\n\nSide note- if you're not a cilantro fan (I'm not) just know that it's mixed in their pico and they can't really remove it. I had asked for no cilantro on my fish tacos and the bartender didn't know they couldn't remove it and I ended up having to scrape the pico off of the top, leaving me with a tortilla and a piece of fish (not really worth the $4.25 price tag!) the customer service was great though, the bartender was incredibly sincere and offered us a free dessert to make up for it. Would definitely come here again besides the cilantro aspect- we saw a table by us get some Mexican corn that looked super delicious!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	rZTwF0-t4bTfLCbPVOr4jA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
GE_USvtZ4q7-oPrMwweicw	3	2015-07-25 00:00:00	There is such a WIERD vibe in here tonight . We waited 20minutes for our drinks after ordering them, while,   in the meantime three different people came over to take our food order!!  take our food order!!!! Can I take your food order?????  CAN WE GET OUR DRINKS FIRST? The girl with the bull ring in her nose, was just clueless. I reordered  a diet coke three times and when she brought me the last one, you'd think she would have taken away the  three REGULAR cokes that were piling up, nope, just left them there. Ughh! It's Not like anybody is really rude or mean, but there is no attention to detail or customer service.  The waiter, as precious as he thinks he is, is rushing by and throws down drinks without stopping, spills water all over the table as he refills the water glasses, giggling  it off as he saunters away, leaving us to wipe up the splattered water that is on the table and cell phones with our own napkins. Then he hounds us to order order order! Ready to order ready to order ready to order???????????????????we haven't  even gotten our appetizers yet. I thought the place was closing based on the urgency to order only to be told\nThey are open another 90 minutes. We are paying the bill for our appetizer and going over to Postino. Something is just to weird and it's making me a NERVOUS WRECK!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	5hfrKyck8DBN96EN9VczUw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The crispy fish was my favorite. I also ordered my favorite margarita, the blood orange, I get that every time I come in.

gi1N1xWoZUXsaYBc3iK8dw	4	2014-11-25 00:00:00	Enjoyed a nice lunch here with friends when I was in Gilbert on a recent weekend. We just walked up. No reservations. We waited just a short time (maybe 5 mins) for our table out on the patio for 9 to be set up. Service from the hostess to our server and the countless others that either brought our orders or refilled our drinks was friendly. They have a lot of young college-aged staff and I thought their customer service was excellent.\n\nchips and salsa on the table as soon as you sit down... I went with a pineapple agua fresca. it was refreshing. kinda perfect on a warm day. \n\nI ordered the 3 taco combo. I went with pork adobada, crispy fish and braised beef. The pork adobada was deliciously guajillo simmered pork served with cabbage, radishes & onions. no cilantro for me in any of these orders. it was a real good taco especially with all the handmade tortillas. the crispy fish taco was excellent, it was a white fish beer battered & fried and served with guacamole, slaw in a white flour tortilla. yumm. the braised beef was served with avocado, cabbage, radish and onions. it was also very tasty. i was happy with all that i had ordered. my order came with a side and i went with the tomato rice but i found it to be a bit lacking in flavor. that was the only downer. everything else was great. \n\nwe celebrated my nephew's 15th birthday at joy ride and we ordered him a caramel brownie. i didnt have any but it looked great. im sure it was as delicious as advertised... i look forward to eating here next time i'm in town.	3	2	4	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	5XAXkk6WENi0OW_HSSXRWA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Awesome lunch special: 3 tacos and half salad under $10. $5 cocktails every day until 5pm.\n\nThe one pitfall: although the complimentary salsa is decent it lacks spice.

GMaHrkwRoUV9RayKscZ61w	4	2016-01-20 00:00:00	Great place that fits right in with downtown Gilbert. \n\nFirst off, I love the feel of the building. Makes you feel your in California next to the beach.  The place is very clean with a modern/hipster feel.   That have a decent beer selection and their personal pitchers is the way to go!! Hands down. You tell me personal and beer pitcher in the same sentence and I'm sold. You had me at hello!! \n\nNow for the tacos!! Some say they are small and they can be a bit pricey, but these pack a lot of flavor and and order of 3 will more then get the job done.  I love how they let you mix n match. I love the chicken, barbacoa, and the steak. Can't go wrong. \n\nBut for all the love of tacos do not skimp on the sides. The Mexican corn is out of this world delicious and the black beans are legit!!  \n\nI came more often when I lived in the area, but still try and find time to find my way back as often as I can.	6	1	2	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	r_fMsMmdPW1uKxOSOxDjbw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

GogDv6oV4T9a_VSsWAMCPA	4	2014-03-06 00:00:00	Starting off with the chips and salsa, I loved both. The atmosphere is cool as others have mentioned. I found zero problem with the service. It was attentive and sufficient. \n\nThe drinks are the best thing. I had the Mexican Mule. \n\nI liked my tacos.  I had a short rib and the pork (called something else to be hip). 2 were enough but they were a bit overpriced for the size. The place is an overall great addition to Gilbert.\n\nUPDATE: From this 1st visit I had some coupons for more tacos and a drink - all FREE. I went back expecting for there to be an up-sell and OK with it.  My friend and I ordered our drinks with alcohol, which should have been extra, I think. At the end, my friend and I asked for the bill but we were told the coupons had taken care of everything. We walked out paying NOTHING (except we left a generous tip for the waitress, of course). \n\nWhat a great way to do business! I'll be back to spend real money.

GQBLSZCS8SL7Ato27fiLWQ	4	2016-01-17 00:00:00	Came here last night with some friends.  We were seated quickly on a Saturday night.  Got our drinks , and chips. The chips were thick, and not my favorite style, but the salsa was great flavor. We also ordered the Habanaro salsa- it was spicy, but not too bad. My blood orange margarita wasn't very good. Tasted like a mix. I ordered a fish taco, and a salad with walnuts,  goat cheese, yellow beets, and a great cumin vinaigrette.  The salad was wonderful! !I could eat it all day!! The taco was good, but super small, and it had a weird mix of corn and flour tortilla consistency.   The fish had good fresh flavor too. My friends each picked 3 tacos. They were done,  and waiting on me to finish my salad. If you are a big eater, get 6 or 7 tacos, or an entree.  Very expensive too. My margarita, salad and taco was $31 with tip.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	-cqwdXaVlPu1mcBX-CgvYg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

It would be 5 stars but the service was attentive but slow and confused (I think they had to many staff people) but that I know will improve with time. I can't wait to try other dishes and drinks. The menu looks TASTY.  The decor was great and comfortable. \n\nIt was hard to identify employees from customers since they don't have anything on to identify them as an employee.  \n\nI can't wait for it to cool down and be able to sit outside.

gqP1hJzm6y1FeXpCMsKAVA	2	2014-04-21 00:00:00	I'm surprised by all of the great reviews on the food at Joyride. I visited last week with my son. I love the atmosphere, the service was great. The food however, was terrible. We had the nachos. very little cheese (not melted) and too much of a white sauce with a very strange flavor, did not enjoy them at all.  Also tried the carne asada tacos. The meat has a very sweet flavor, very noticeably sweet. When I asked about it, they told me the meat is marinated in orange juice and does have a sweet flavor. They traded them out for the shredded beef tacos which I also did not enjoy. The corn tortillas on all the tacos are soft and quickly become soggy so the whole thing falls apart when you try to pick it up. My son had the red chile tamales. Besides red chile, they also had strips of carrots and zucchini inside (not indicated on the menu). The beans had no flavor. We love mexican food but were so disappointed. Despite the fun decor and atmosphere, we would not go back. If you are looking for good, authentic mexican, this is not the place. It's nothing like Carolina's or La Canasta (very good simple authentic mexican food) - they can't even compete with Macayos. The chips were ok, didn't like the salsa though. In addition, our bill was over $30. I don't mind paying for good food but expensive for terrible food? Seems like the kind of place that gets a lot of one time customers.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	8yPl8pqS-LAr4PU1o2trig	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
Gr3ZyzocTn_CANHc9KUhdw	1	2014-08-28 00:00:00	Well... The only joy here was when I was riding home putting this place in my rear view mirror.  Truly a letdown... the place was busy (it does have a great atmosphere).  My wife and I were excited to try the food out.  Started with Mexican street corn... unseasoned and out of season corn.  My wife and I each tried 3 different tacos (6 total).  There was not 1 out of the 6 that I would ever want to order again.  Two main themes... under seasoned or strange flavors and little hard burnt bits in almost everything.  The only thing that I thought was passable was the chips and salsa.  Although, after reading other reviews, the question has to be asked... what does this place have against seasoning their food?  And, who are these people who are recommending this place as having great food.  Again it it's a shame that with a great location presentation and atmosphere they could not produce a quality dish.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	2_FsGqNEoh1omfD0n2GSOw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Guacamole was a little different than typical but very tasty. Enjoyed the chunks of avocado. My husband ate half his burrito and complained there was too much rice. That being said if was very tasty rice. Little light on the chicken. I had the Baja taco and a chicken one, both very tasty.  I would come back to the Joyride Taco House.

As a proud member of the Arcadia community, I rarely venture out of my bubble, but I'm glad we made the trek all the way out to Gilbert. The little downtown area where Joyride is located is adorable and obviously a hotspot on the weekends. My boyfriend and I came in early on Saturday night, around 5pm, and the place was already packed. The hostesses were very accommodating and showed us over to the bar where we waited for only about 5 minutes before we were shown to our table. Our server Dan was awesome! Super friendly, knowledgeable and helpful in making our dinner decisions. We had carne asada nachos-FREAKING BOMB-the ahi stack-refreshing and very tasty-Mexican street corn-DELISH-and an assortment of tacos, all of which were fantastic-my fave was the shrimp. And here's a helpful tip, if you join their "eposse" they send awesome coupons, our appetizers were completely free! It's safe to say I highly recommend this place and that I'll be back!	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Cp8xfCijg_DRUWXima73WQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
h131i3EY90Bz7NQgJONMfA	1	2016-03-08 00:00:00	We have been coming here for almost 2 years. Keeps going downhill on service. They now charge for chips and salsa. Sort of seems like a hipster spot as of recent. The taco Tuesday and 2pm specials seem to always change depending on what server you have. Think this is our last time coming here which sucks cause it was our lunch spot for a while. Referring to the Gilbert location. The last 6 visits have gotten worse and worse in service. There's a taco shop across the street we're going to try. \n\nJust gave this place another try. Worse service than last time. No refills. Only offered one margarita then given the check. Food was decent at best. Asked to speak to a manager and he came over, looked about 16 years old and didn't seem to care that we had bad service the first time, tried it again, had even worse service. He said he'll try to do better and that was it. Very disappointed.	3	3	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	SiJfhPeVqodJZtB-5aQPRA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

We obviously love the tacos, because we keep coming back.  Definitely go on Tuesday or during happy hour for $2 tacos!\n\nThe service is still hit or miss, sometimes it is good, sometimes you have to ask for things multiple times.  You never know how its gonna be.\n\nWe try something new every time we go....the beans...huge disappointment, don't waste your money!  The cheese y mas is very good!!  Not worth the normal price of $9.00 (outrageous), but we will get it again during happy hour for $4.00.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	EygiTPZXMpTWNZa7gpwR2g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
HA7FJcsGj0mPwkzh208GXw	3	2016-02-24 00:00:00	3.5 stars\n\nA group of 4 - about $75 \nOn our table: \nMexican street corn\nVegetarian tacos\nCrispy fish taco\nCarne asada taco\nCarnitas taco\nNachos\nBeast burrito \n\nDrinks: \nAlmond horchata\nRosemary mint tea\nIced tea\nCoke\n\nThe atmosphere: The atmospheric here is cool. It had outdoor seating and indoor seating, tables and chairs and some booths with pops of color here and there. The seats are adorable. The only odd thing was that I sat back to open water pitchers and if I had left my hair down I may have been able to get in another bath for the day. They have outdoor seating and on a less windy day I would have enjoyed our meal outside but I like my food hot when it's suppose to be hot. \n\nThe service: I don't know who our server was. A younger guy came and took our drink order and another brought out our drinks and then a young lady came and took our order and the younger guy came to take our order again then someone else brought our food. We had water refilled but not offered to refill our soda.. They did continually bus our table as we finished plates though.   I think the only highlight of the service was the last guy came to talk us into desserts and named every ingredient for each dessert like his life depended on it but couldn't sell us on it but did sound good. So right here is where a part of my 3.5 star review came into play. Honestly if there was a good flow here I think lunch would have been better but in their defense they were absolutely nice. Just not attentive and no communication between each other.  \n\nThe food: \nMexican street corn was probably the only thing I'd come back for. \n\nMy hubs did enjoy his beast burrito. \n\nThe tacos were really the only thing we had come here for in the first place but they didn't hit the mark. Maybe I'm not used to cold food, maybe the the corn tortillas is supposed to be that thick? Is this typical & I just don't know good tacos when I see them? I've eaten a lot of tacos in my life (it shows) and these were ok but not wow. The crispy fish taco I think could have been really good but was a tad too salty but at least it wasn't greasy and rubbery. \n\nThe nachos lacked cheese. I think good nachos should have good coverage, layered for every chip to hang out with some cheese, a protein and pico. A good nacho can then have a cohesive marriage. These nachos were in a long distance relationship.\n\nWhat I like is going places that have a vegetarian menu. This place offers such but the offerings  taste-wise were just okay.\n\nThe horchata - technically our only specialty drink. It was ok - not overly sweet but idk if it was too nutty with the almonds for my taste. It almost had a nutmeg flavor in it and maybe I'm just used to a more cinnamon-y rice drink. \n\nSo overall it was ok all around. Not overly disappointed when we left but not excited for another visit here. \n\nWould I recommend? There's potential. The location is great. The people are nice. The food could be better and customer service could be better. -----but no I probably wouldn't recommend or bring my friends here if they were craving Mexican fare.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	fG1bDnmABWi_KIJpzXDd9Q	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The guys stuck with the pitchers of beer, while us girls tried out a few of the "coctels" and "agua frescas" My favorite was the Mazatlan Mule.\n\nWe started with the nachos and found them to be amazing. Ordinary nachos just will not do it for me ever again.\n\nIt was hard to decide on what tacos to order, they all sounded great, and no one was disappointed in what was placed before us. The carnitas, short rib and shrimp were among the favorites. \n\nAnd don't forget to order a few sides....among the best were the mexican street corn and the heirloom anasazi beans\n\nWe cannot wait for much cooler weather so we can enjoy the great outdoor seating they have\n\nSo run to Joyride Taco House if you are in the area....	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	XDTHfl80ohRG2oyyh0e3fg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Looking forward to trying the pineapple mojito on my next visit. I loved the chicken, corn and poblano tamale. I wish the rice was more of a mexican rice but the grilled vegetables with the dish were very tasty. My husband is still talking about the street corn. All in all we had a great meal. When the weather is nice the outdoor seating would be great. It was a little loud inside but too hot to enjoy the outside space.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	omMoaLFL66z3AaCxzwZ9ng	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Food is definitely 5 stars but giving it 4 stars because I really wish I had one server when we went. All the servers help out each other which is nice but never quite sure who to ask for something when we need it. Everyone is super friendly and fast. This is definitely a great place to bring family and friends.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	pi5RKTt1qP74EVud7agQ-w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
HIt5aJHyRKhw0Sdk_rIlDA	2	2014-12-08 00:00:00	I've been here enough times to say that this is a perfectly fine place to hang out. The service is great, the restaurant is actually very nicely designed, from what I've heard the cocktails are pretty delicious, and refills on chips are free. \n\nThat said, I have never enjoyed the food. I've had a chimichanga, tamales, and a couple of different side items, all of which I felt either lacked flavor or were more money than they were worth. The cheese and chorizo side is good if you don't mind spending $9 on queso dip, but the beans, tamales, and burritos I've had have inspired a resounding "meh" in me.\n\nTaking on the moniker of a taco house was an ambitious move in a city like Phoenix. If they called themselves "Mod Living Room with Patio, Cocktails and Chips," I would find the branding more honest.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	yVux4cP2BIuHDUv7RXpXPw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
HjIdCLKqanpN8Wh_lIVt8A	2	2016-12-29 00:00:00	Charging for salsa refills is ridicules. They give you a very small amount with chips and don't tell you to use it sparingly because no more salsa for you a unless you pay extra. It's Mexican food for crying out loud and you need salsa.

Service was good and the waitress was informative when we had questions because there are a few funky items on the menu. We asked if we could get the vegetable enchiladas without mushroom and the waitress said no because they are all pre made? Food was ok, everything is a la carte so it gets pretty pricey.

hQ4JfxMWj0AWje8rQ-AvcA	2	2016-03-23 00:00:00	Came for my birthday. Gotta say I just expected a delicious taco with all the hype.... This is a super trendy taco joint, great vibe, great customer service. However the food was a let down. The tacos are piled with stuff that takes away from the little akward flavor the meats had. The best thing I absolutely loved is the corn tortillas it came on. They seemed fresh and homemade. For the price you are paying I was expecting authentic bomb street tacos, instead I paid for what looked like art in a tortilla, it looked nice but wasnt up to par with the taco cart in Juarez. It was a big disappointment when you can get a better taco from a taco cart, then you can from this potentially awesome restaurant. So if your into food photography this is the best place to snap some pics, if you are craving a authentic bomb taco, look elsewhere.	9	2	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	bDF4XoMF-bApT_YQD_duTg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I ordered a couple of tacos, and my friends also enjoyed the good (tacos and vegetarian burrito). \n\nHowever, the service was blah. They forgot an item and drink we ordered, and they arrived about 20 minutes later. So late that everyone else was done eating. There seemed to be confusion over who was managing our table- different people kept stopping by to tell us the food and drink were coming, but we continued to wait. They did credit our bill, and I'm willing to give them another shot because I liked the food and drinks.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	uAu7pH1BkVNRR0BJS8IHbg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Unfortunately, this place is always packed- which really wouldn't be a problem if the staff here were more organized. Every time I come I really hope for a better experience with my waiter each time, but instead I find myself looking for someone to make eye contact with me to place an order, ask a question, etc. It always kind of feels like my table has been forgotten.

I ordered the chipotle chicken tamales, hmmm they weren't seasoned as I would expect, actually I did not find the chipotle in my chicken and the third comment is that we ordered the hot habanero salsa and it was not hot at all :( . The service was a little slow but I understand it was a crowded friday night, if the waitress would be a little more friendly I wouldn't mind that detail.\n\nThe place is nice to go out, the food not so good to my mexican palate, the drinks I would give them a second chance, perhaps.	0	1	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	H5MWl-kvkU3vRkQRAAotMQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

htFtCul-gfmW-fOFrm8gZg	2	2013-07-21 00:00:00	Ok, so my family and I went here for lunch today (Saturday) for the first time. We got there just before 1:30pm and we were seated right away even though 5 minutes earlier when I called them on the phone to see if there was a wait, the guy who answered told me there was a 20 to 25 minute wait. What's up with that? \n\nSo we had no less than 5 different servers. They were all nice, hipster types but the girl that took our drink order never came back so I had to flag down the next random person to place our order. We got 4 different tacos (the carne asada, shrimp, crunchy fish, and grilled fish) to split between me and my son, my husband got the tamale plate, and we ordered the kids quesadilla for my 1 year old. Thankfully, the quesadilla came out first because the baby was getting antsy. As for the rest of our food, it took FOREVER to come out. In the meantime, we were munching on the chips and salsa. The salsa was good although the chips were NOT. But we were starving so we had no other choice.\n\nWhen we finally got our food, it was good. But honestly, the gourmet tacos at Rubio's are way better and way more filling for less than the price they are here. We would have ordered more food but it was so expensive, we felt it wasn't worth the money or ungodly time it would take for another order to come out. We did, however, order the churros for dessert. They came out fairly quickly and were good and came with melted chocolate for dipping. \n\nSo when we asked for the bill, they brought it to us on a clothespin! Basically it was the receipt and a clothespin which my husband and I thought was pretty weird but funny. However, the amount we had to pay for such little food was NOT funny at all... It was just over $60!!! Yikes! So not worth it!\n\nSo if you're a trendy hipster living in the burbs with cash to burn this place is definitely for you! My family and I will stick to Rubio's. Definitely won't be coming back to this overrated joint.	6	2	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	45F5zJn_axODPiOtxrIRpg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

hWYSaLGpAMh3x32jjU_wlw	5	2013-12-28 00:00:00	Went today for an early lunch. We enjoyed ourselves and enjoyed almost all of our food. The reason I gave them five stars is because when one of the servers picked up our dishes she noticed we hadn't eaten the soup. She asked if we enjoyed the chicken tortilla soup and I told her it was too chili based which I am not a fan of. What I didn't expect was for them to remove it from our check. That was a big suprise and unexpected. Great customer service, so lets take a step back and talk about the food. We ordered their lunch special which allowed us to order two tacos each and either soup or a half of their salads (3 interesting ones to choose from). I ordered the baja fish and the ahi tuni with a half salad. My husband ordered the standard chicken and the braised beef taco with the chicken tortilla soup at $9.95. As we waited we enjoyed their homemade chips and salsa that had a little kick (yummy). I also ordered a yummy virgin aqua fresca (pineapple). The only disappointment was no free refills on the aqua fresca (but it was to be expected as they will also make them with alcohol). The salad had papaya in it and was a bit overdressed but thank goodness for a light tasting vinagrette. Overall, we will defintely be back. We also left feeling it was the right proportion of food. Joyride is on the other side of Postino's and also to the left of Oregano's. so many places to choose from in Gilbert but when in the mood for tacos I definitely recoomend Joyride.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	NTKoSWyT3Wa1giiQ2Fzx3g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

It is full of delicious drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic. They have a large selection of juices including cucumber and horchata. I was in love with my almond and cinnamon horchata. You can't go wrong with their guacamole. Their tacos were awesome. I personally loved the shrimp taco best. \nPRICES- 5 starts. Prices range around $3/taco.

I had the 3 fish taco selection of Baja grilled fish, ahi tuna, and crispy fish. They were all excellent - grilled probably the best. Orange cucumber salad ordered with tacos was a nice cool off to the spicy salsa. Total bill was $19 and well worth it. Very nice and upbeat atmosphere - but wondering about the open air design when summer rolls around in Gilbert with the cow dairies close by.... You know, flies may be a problem -but I guess they can always shut the windows. Nice addition to downtown Gilbert!

The blood orange and prickly pear margaritas were great. Then for dinner we had some corn appetizer dish which was the highlight of the meal. I'd go back just for that. Dinner was a chilaquille dish and a veg enchilada with green and red sauce. It was good but not the best. I'd give this a 4.5 but I'll round it up.

I5RTO36QWoq5q7z9hBy1Aw	3	2017-05-29 00:00:00	5-17-17.  I have been wanting to try this place as I have heard good things.  First the atmosphere is nice, a very trendy retro vibe.  The large bar in the middle of the room looked like a fun place to sit if you were by yourself or with one friend.  It was a Saturday night about 5:30 so the place was crowded.  We were told we had to wait 20 minutes and found a place to sit outside while we waited.  A waitress came around and asked all of us who were waiting if we wanted to order drinks.  She did not offer any drink menus so I didn't know about the extensive margarita selection this place has.  I ordered the regular house margarita which was freshly made with real lime juice.  I really liked it.  We were seated after about a 20 minute wait on the outside patio.  This area is kept cool with misters so it was enjoyable for people watching. Our waiter was very pleasant and brought hot chips and salsa out right away.  I ordered the crispy fish taco, carne asada taco and a side of rice.  The tacos come in a little metal taco holder so they stay up and the filling doesn't fall out.  The rice came on a separate little plate.  The crispy fish taco I ordered was just OK,  it was not hot and it wasn't really crisp either.  It was like the fish was cooked a while ago and held under a hot light. I have had better elsewhere.  The carne asada taco had nice flavoring and had crispy pieces like you would get from your backyard barbeque.  These tacos were small street tacos.  The rice was typical mexican rice.  Nothing special here.  Overall my opinion is the margarita was great and the food OK but I didn't feel the atmosphere and food made the price worth it for me to want to come back.  I don't live near here so I don't think this is a place I will repeat to.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	7boCdBEcVeKlnNTsO9GwVQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
i7hmSGrlsPJlMv5J1S6J9g	2	2015-04-21 00:00:00	The salsa that came with the chips was too spicy so I asked if they have a milder salsa. The waitress said they have some pico that was milder a brought some out. However, there was a $2 charge for the pico and we weren't told.  They removed the pico charge upon my request. I wanted a taco salid but they didn't have one on the menu so I had nachos with added chicken. The chicken was spongy and didn't seem to be real chicken chunks. The cheese was a white sauce and not flavorful so the nachos were bland. The service was fine.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	z-lqRThsfh0ZhYthmncAqA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

They have a taco for everyone and are happy to make a taco any way you want it. My fav is the shrimp and my hubs was the braised beef. The tortilla soup was delish. Nice atmosphere, clean, but service was a bit slow and I was confused about who my server was. Two nice outdoor patios. Ill go back....I like tacos.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	SmvpVTRKtUyN6LbVmVHk6w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Loved the patio seating, and a fun place to go for a quick date night, or meeting with some girlfriends. \n\nThe tacos are very good, but small so if you're a big eater you might want to get a little extra. \n\nIt can get busy quick (especially at night), so make sure to come a little ahead of time to grab some parking and put your name down on the list. \n\nHave fun!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	6YgAI3lg5N8p-setFUFEAg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

They have a good beer selection and service has always been on point. We even came here with an infant a few different times and they even made special accommodations for us. I always find myself recommending this place to people!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	1T1x_58P-As_rB1mGITklw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

iIpJJP6XFUk0nLL-pefJDQ	3	2014-08-21 00:00:00	After driving past this place and looking at the menu online, I thought Joyride would be the perfect taco place for me. They have a few vegetarian options, cool sounding drinks, and the atmosphere looked fun. I was a tad disappointed however.\n\nThere were some things I really liked about Joyride, and some things I did not like so much. One good thing was the service, the servers were very attentive. Even a few servers who were not our server for the night came up to check on us, which I thought was nice. I also liked the decor, very mod and I like the color scheme.\n\nI ordered three veggie tacos with the cucumber orange salad as my side. It is nice they you get to have a free side with three tacos. The tacos were good but not great. The first one I ate had a soggy tortilla, the other two tortillas were fine. Also there was a tiny piece of something hard and inedible in my first taco, which was unpleasant. I wish I would have ordered the black beans as my side instead too because the salad was kind of gross. Also the side would have cost $4.00 which is ridiculous for like 3 cucumber spears, 2 mandarin orange segments, and a few seeds. I tried to like it, but I just couldn't! Also my boyfriend got the Key Largo drink, and I am glad I did not order one because I was not a fan. He thought it was too vanilla-y, but did not totally hate it. The chips and salsa were yummy though, so there is a plus.\n\nAnother downside was the price. Mine wasn't too bad, but my boyfriend's meal was nearly $30 for a drink, burrito, and a taco. Overall, Joyride is not bad, but did not quite meet my expectations.	2	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	18qEoFOVEernpVLh97PQPQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
iiRJ18psVjJmPmGLc58L-g	3	2013-12-16 00:00:00	OK if there was a 3 1/2 stars that is what I would have given it.  Love the decor and rocking 80's music.  Service was very good.  Great deal on pitchers of beer.  Chips and house salsa are very good as well.  Now the OK stuff.  Tacos were pretty good.  I had the chicken tinga.  It was suppose to have "magic white sauce" but mine apparently didn't have it.  On a side note, maybe that is a good thing since Joyride Taco House seems like a name for a porno shop.  Chicken tinga was a little bland, likely better with the magic sauce.  Carne asada taco was good.  I personally thought it was a bit pricey for what you got.  Bottom line is that I  would return to drink beer and have chips and salsa especially since we found out the one patio is dog friendly.  I would say give it a try.  Never know you may get the magic white sauce.  ;)	0	3	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	mRV7P4bGHxdaIFdc6lbHKw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

IlowoMOc7hG8V-v-5OB98g	2	2015-10-05 00:00:00	Went to Joyride tonight with my wife.  Both of us needed a fix for churros with chocolate.  We were hoping for something similar to what we had in Madrid near Plaza Mayor and Calle Toledo about a year ago.  It was nowhere near that.  We still say what we had in Madrid was more to our liking.\n\nThe churros at Joyride in Gilbert were too sugary, and therefore too sweet\nThe churros were missing the cinnamon...only tasted the sugar\nThe chocolate was too sweet.\n\nOn our drive back home to Mesa, my wife and I discussed this, and said that what we had for churros at Joyride was nothing like like Madrid.  Perhaps if we want churros like what we had in Madrid, we shall have to return to Madrid.	1	3	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	jqyS91iI63nyztPAvRk1AQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
iPlmPoO2-962BRVHmxLHpQ	5	2017-06-01 00:00:00	We tried this place tonight, on Gilbert Rd where there are many cool places to eat (Dierks Bentley's Whisky Row is across the street) and the tacos were amazing!  The tacos are a la carte so you can get different ones.  I had the a carne asada taco and a shrimp taco, soooo good!  The carne asada taco was so full of flavor!  Now, our server,  Tori, was a doll!  She was very helpful and had such a great personality!  If anything, we will return, just to see her...she was adorable!  I wish that more servers were like her.  I highly recommend trying this place.  The decor reminded me of the 70's, but it was done just right.  Even the music went with the vibe.  Tori proceeded to tell us of their drink special times where they have seven different flavors of margaritas for $5, as well as $5 pitchers of beer.  You can sit outside and watch the cars and people go by, sit inside, or on their back patio.  Again, ask for Tori's section, you won't be sorry!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	gAV3cFD3pR73EpswyQzfQg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

IVqkx7DaBrzf00suYwaaZQ	2	2014-07-30 00:00:00	I've heard so many good things about Joyride that I was super excited when the opportunity came up to try it out. I had very high expectations. I guess it goes to show, that time & time again, when expectations are high, they are hardly ever met.\n\nMy comments about the service are very positive .. No complaints at all. When we walked into the restaurant, there were quite a few tables open & the hostess let us pick where we sat. The establishment isn't that large, but it was kind nonetheless for her to offer us the option. In general, we noticed they are really quick about bringing chips & salsa to the table as they do it as soon as all patrons are seated. They are good at keeping water glasses filled, making sure any questions are answered about the menu, orders are put in right away, etc.\n\nMy comments about the food are not so positive. I opted to get three tacos (comes with a free side when you get 3) - the shrimp taco, the crispy fish taco, & the chicken tinga taco (the second two per recommendation of our waitress). None of them blew me away .. Nor were they even that good to mention to someone. The chicken tinga was just spicy, which I am ok with, but lacked flavor. The shrimp was the same way. I would say of the three, the crispy fish was the best, but again, nothing to rave about, & almost too heavy with the added stuff on top. I got the black beans as my side ... My mistake. They just tasted like beans out of a can topped with a little bit of cheese. No seasoning. I didn't understand nor enjoy them. My dining-mate got the veggie burrito & it was really good. For how much he paid, he enjoyed it & more.\n\nLastly, it's to be noted that there are a ton of flies in the restaurant. It was not only annoying, but also felt un-sanitary. I almost wanted to leave before we even ordered, but decided to stick around. I guess I should've gone with my original gut instinct!	0	1	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	CjhTdmN6qWEKC7Zo6qadow	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Ix9TK6coLr2UXv4cjK_N9w	4	2015-01-04 00:00:00	Side note: I NEVER come to this part of Gilbert (don't live close by), but there's a cute few blocks of restaurants & I'd definitely venture out here again to try some other places. End aside...\n\nI met a friend here for HH and really like it! It was on a Tuesday which meant "Taco Tuesday (all tacos are $2 each)." I had a crispy fish taco, that was good. The breading was crispy & the slaw that was on it was crisp as well. I also had a carne asada taco. The meat was a little dry, but it was still very good. We also had chips & salsa, and honestly all of this would have been a good meal. The tacos are pretty decently sized. \n\nHowever, since it was HH I ordered a quesadilla as well (intending to split it) and it was HUGE. It was thick, full of a ton of cheese, and was yummy. During HH Joyride does certain apps for $4 (the quesadilla was one of these) & $6. I saw a lot of people were ordering nachos & the platter they were served looked HUGE! \n\nI ordered a couple margs as well. I started w/a prickly pear even though I generally don't like flavored margaritas. Honestly, it was a bit sweet but still good. I also got a regular marg. It didn't stand out it in any way, but it was still good. \n\nThe service at Joyride was good, as well. I'll come back!	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	W5cwxNwGiZJd393PCDQEvA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Food was good, overpriced for the demographic  and offerings in my option, but a nice selection of options no less.  The service on the other hand, terrible.  We had to continually ask for drinks until we took matters into our own hands and went to the bar directly.  This shouldn't be the case when you're seated in the dining area.  Waiter didn't follow up when the food arrived, and a side of salsa that was requested when the order went in, took asking 4 times!  \n\nI will drive the extra mile to visit other Upward concepts, but wouldn't patron this place again based on the service experience, or really, lack there of.	4	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	PA6KNY2e4PITPrBCH2h-kg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

We were a party of four, but only received one bowl of chip pieces (some unbroken chips on top were covering the pieces).  When asked for another bowl, we were told there was a charge! We noticed that tables of two received the same sized bowl. As far as we know no manager was present.  Food was good, however, but in today's newspaper this business was shown as having several health violations.  We can understand why.

We sat at the bar and were greeted promptly and given chips and salsa.\n\nI ordered the shrimp and crispy fish tacos. Hubby tried the carnitas tacos. My shrimp taco was very disappointing. Out of the 3 shrimp two had pieces of shell on them and one was burned to a crisp. I asked the bartender if it was customary to leave the shells on the shrimp. He said yes. I said are you  sure and I showed him the tail of one of the shrimp. He  took it to his manager who said that they would replace the taco. The next one was cooked correctly. Overall the food is pretty average nothing special. They do have happy hour price drinks until 5 PM so that was a nice bonus.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	TxbdbgccJ0g7ohRy7cXjEw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

jMaTSqajFlkvpqaDK5WRcg	4	2013-07-02 00:00:00	When a taco house commands this type of price tag, I except very very good food, and we gave it a chance.. \n\nWe noticed immediately that the waiter was very attentive and they kept refilling our cups every 2 seconds... that's good I guess, but it's a little distracting. Even though I'm not a very big person (at least that's what I think), there was not much elbow or table room. Almost a little crowded for me. For dinner time, the music can be a little higher than the normal 'family' restaurant, but I love the music selection! Lots of good rock with a mix of dance. I can see myself and a few friends hanging out here for drinks, but probably not bring the 3 year old back.\n\nThe nacho app platter is probably going to be our favorite.. it was plentiful! The rotisserie chicken juicy and tender, fresh and full of flavor. Very soft to cut, and easily pulled apart. The eggplant/veggie mix and lime rice that it came with were to die for.. very light and delicious. Just enough spice. Hubs had the horchata, steak burrito and grilled fish taco, in which he said was delicious. Kiddo had the quesadilla kid's meal.. Food is definitely more elevated than other 'gourmet' mexican food restaurants.\n\nAll came to was $65 for 2.5 people. Tasty food, lively and interesting decor, but pricey food if you don't mind that.	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	gAmmEZLSdj5KXvOlPUQRfQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
jMEyw7y-nlVdVFHcUjJjtA	4	2015-07-18 00:00:00	When my friend invited me to the Hale theater I asked her if she wanted to indulge in some light bites before the show and she agreed. Not sure what was over there since I live clear over on the other side of town I told her to pick. Amongst the list of fantastic new eateries right at the theater was Joyride.\n\n Not the biggest fan of Tex- Mex food it takes a lot to get me to want to try Mexican. I have only about three favorites and constant Mexican eateries I will go to in town and they are more of a traditional Mexican. With that said, I had heard how great this place was so I wanted to give it a try. The verdict? Thumbs up! They have a great Happy Hour, good Guac, and tasty street tacos. ( And cheap!) My Raspberry Ancho Marg drink was tasty and again, cheap! \n\nThe place was packed though. On the way out and I got spilled on twice. Pretty tight quarters for sure if you sit inside. I guess that is part of the fun. I had a shoe that smelled like beer all evening. Oh yeah, the servers were all very nice. The food was delivered fast with a group concept. I like group concept restaurants. I'd go back. However, maybe  to the phoenix location closer to my hood.	2	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	dEk7mXM4npuDPmxrwPcEgQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
jNGMC1ns_KqDEZCZC0nm-g	4	2016-10-27 00:00:00	Overall the food was really tasty.  However, enchilada style means only enchilada sauce, no cheese.  Also, they need to clean their meat a little better.  The carne asada had a lot of funky bits in it.  I will go back though.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	5Bmt9x2gWpOYuj5NXceftg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Quite possibly the best tacos I've ever had (carne asada, baja fish, and short rib). Not sure if the 2 star reviewers are on crack, but these tacos were muy delicioso and service was definitely top notch. I can't wait to be able to sit outside in their lawn area with some tacos and brewskies without melting away.	1	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	lGidKQIri6cCu0pYZBlckw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
jRRrsG3uH9rGCZbnhUfydw	3	2013-06-16 00:00:00	I branched out of my normal stopping grounds to join a friend at his birthday dinner in Downtown Gilbert.  We dined at Joyride just a day after it opened, and there was quite the buzz which resulted in about a 20 minute wait, which was no big deal.  The interior is modern and bright, and very typical of what I have come to expect from the Upwards Project group.\n\nThe best dish of the night was the Joyride Guacamole, it was topped with little pieces of crispy manchengo cheese, which makes plain guacamole look super boring.  The chips were thick, some of my dining partners didn't care for them, but for thick chips I thought they were pretty good.  The salsa that they bring out was a smoky, thick red salsa, it reminded me of the salsa from Chevy's. They have some other salsas that you can order a la carte, but we stuck with the free stuff.\n\nFor our main dishes we got a variety of tacos and the nachos with carnitas.  I am a huge nacho fan, and I found these to be a bit underwhelming.  They were beautiful in appearance, but the cheese sauce that they put on them was pretty bland and they overloaded them with mushy, black beans.  The carnitas were decent, but I have had better.  The tacos were pretty hit and miss, the chicken tinga was the standout, the grilled fish was decent, but the carne asada was chewy and very lacking in flavor.  I am not sure if it was the cut of beef or the cooking, but either way, America's Taco Shop or even Filiberto's does carne asada better.\n\nI know another Joyride is in the works on Central Ave., so I will probably give it another try when they open, but it is not something I loved so much that I will take a field trip just to eat.	2	0	2	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	NFgvM7LMx5Ocsxr7J2_sVA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Here's where we went wrong (apparently), the bartenders started off attentive, but that was short lived. Once our food arrive not once did either of them check on us. The busser/or server did, not the bartenders. They were so wrapped up in cleaning/side work  we didn't get to order our second round of drinks, ask for more guacamole or even get our check in a timely fashion. We actually waited 20 mins to ask some one if we could pay. Then another 10 mins for them to actually bring us the correct tab. I've been here numerous times! Truly disappointed....\n\nOn a good note, the food is always good.\n\nWe left and went next door to postinos to finish our meal.

jwPQclyWH6AsoWjzeFulYA	1	2015-08-10 00:00:00	Ambiance: It was Sunday afternoon. We had about 20 min. wait so they texted us when the table was ready (better than having to wait outside or carry a buzzer). There were 2 trans-gender bathrooms & 1 women's bathroom. The bar was pretty full with people drinking cocktails in the middle of the afternoon. There were 2 flat screen TVs hanging in the bar area, one showing golf & the other showing baseball. The sound level was pretty noisy due to the number of customers in the dining room. It was very bright due to the sun shining in through all the windows. There was outdoor seating & a fireplace for cooler weather.  \nFood: Great chicken burritos if you like mushroom & mango. Finding a piece of chicken was like finding a needle in a haystack. \nThe complimentary salsa on the table was too hot so we had to pay $2 for a small bowl of pico de gallo which arrived warm (much to my husband's chagrin). \nThe complimentary chips were the best thing I had. They were thin & salty.\nThere was complimentary cold water on the table for us which was great since it was very hot outside.\nThe carne asada taco with cilantro & cabbage had a spicy sauce that made it inedible for me, after one bite I was drinking my water trying to rescue my tongue. I ended up having to give it to my husband who said it was great.\nMy daughters split a chicken burrito which we specified they only wanted chicken. However, it is either cooked in a spicy sauce or they added something spicy because one of my daughters couldn't eat it. \nCheese was non-existent in any of our meals. \nWaitstaff: The waitstaff was attentive & happily explained the menu since we told them it was our first visit. \nPrices: $3.50 for a street taco served with a flour tortilla. $10.50 for a quesailla. $8.00 for a chicken burrito. They have taco Tuesday with $2 tacos & margaritas are $5 before 5pm.\nOverall, I would say it is not a place to go if you don't enjoy spicy food.	2	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	RMdj47BCxcee5BJ8-z-SMQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

They are a little different than the traditional saucy enchilada, but good flavor.  The rice was very good and the mexican slaw had pumpkin seeds in it, which added a nice crunch!

jyG_1JsL8UFP7DZDomU_ig	2	2017-07-21 00:00:00	My experience at joyride tonight was pretty disappointing. I am new to the area and had several recommend joyride to me. We were a group of 5 - 3 kids, 2 adults.  I knew that this was a busy restaurant and was not upset to have to wait about 30 min for a table, I was less happy to sit at our table for another 10 min or so before seeing our server. Our server was friendly and efficient but perhaps a little too busy, as she was pretty rushed every time she stopped at out table. \n  Our food came at strange intervals, kids food first, then our appetizer, then once the kids were pretty much finished my and my husbands meal came out. We split the 3 taco plate. 2 grilled fish tacos and one shrimp. Here's where things really went down hill. The fish smelled pretty fishy before the plate was even at the table but we thought maybe we were just being weird for some reason. Nope. The grilled fish in the tacos was definitely less than fresh and had a sour low tide kind of taste. We each took one bite and decided that it was a no go. Our server was great and took the plate right away and replaced the order with veggie tacos which came out in about 10 minutes. \n I know the restaurant did everything they could to take care of the problem but by the time we got our new tacos our kids were bouncing off the walls and ready to go. The veggie tacos were just ok, the kids food was ok at best and the wait times were a little too much for me. Not to mention, how did no one in the kitchen notice the stink of the fish?!?\n Our server did comp the taco meal and offer us free desert, which was nice but this place did not live up to my expectation at all. Sorry joyride but I think I will be getting my taco fix elsewhere from now on.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	GhIbG9FVCKTeNyqsTbYaKQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
k-t1mmGWdIRxsCnKeT0fsw	4	2016-01-23 00:00:00	Been dying for the $5 cocktail deal lately and ended up taking a chance on lunch today, and it was glorious. I went for the tacos this time and while they ain't cheap, I wouldn't call them overpriced for the quality. The Pork Adovada, Braised Beef, and Crispy Fish were all scrummy (the latter two a bit more than the first), and the cucumber orange salad we ordered alongside was very near to perfect (they should cut the cukes a bit smaller). We also got the veggie burrito (whatever it's called) sans rice, and it was so frickin good, our eyes were rolling back in our heads. We were sweet talked into dessert and got the churros, a little too much sugar on them but they were so so good.\n\nWe got out of there for $42 bucks before tip for all of that and two happy hour cocktails. Very reasonable for such a flavor-packed meal, with succinct but personable, knowledgable, and speedy service, and of course the energetic atmosphere. I'll definitely start coming here more often.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	pNzFq2QcLNV_zBRkemeRsg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Even though they were closing at 4:00 p.m. Christmas Eve, they let my group of 15 adults and kids come in at 3:00.  The seven young grandkids sat at a table near us, and the manager took the time to learn their names so she could ask each what they wanted to order. This made them feel special.  She even treated us and the kids to a free guacamole appetizer! \n\nThe food was delicious, as always.  Good variety of well-stuffed tacos.  I made sure everyone ordered the Mexican corn (off the cob), and not one kernel was left.  Our server had a fun sense of humor and paid the right amount of attention to us.

Food was great, we tried a few different tacos. We were unable to try and fru-fru drinks as we had an appointment to go to after, but saw quite a few come out of the bar.  \n\nWe sat outside, a very nice patio behind the building, helps you not hear the street traffic. They have a section w/ real grass, we saw a few customers w/ dogs show up. that was ok as the dogs were kept on leashes. \n\nWe ordered 2 tacos each to start. received the chips and salsa... and couldn't stop eating them!! we finished the basket before our tacos came, and they brought another one. we ate them too. Our tacos arrived. based on the price, I felt they were a bit small, but they were very good. Fresh ingredients, that's for sure.\n\nWe both ordered two more tacos (and more chips and salsa) and enjoyed them.\n\nOur server was friendly, a bit busy as it seemed he may have been the only one and the place was packed. But not a problem, it was a nice relaxing time. \n\nHowever, as we sat outside and the sun moved, we went from in the shade to in the full sun. they need a few more umbrellas, as the 3 they had were being used by those on the grass. speaking of those on the grass, a group of about 10 showed up and sat in the lawn chairs on the grass, enjoying each others company and a few drinks. Nice idea!  \n\nDidn't go inside, so can't review on that. For sure we will go back. When we stood up to leave, the manager came over and asked us how it was. We told him great, as it was, and that we wish we had ordered 3 tacos to start off instead of 2. he suggested that if we like a certain type of taco, and are very hungry, order the burrito, it's much larger, and costs less than 3 tacos. will try that next time.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	-DmrFVzkT3bkDcmeq1tbtQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

KJsUL0i9aMQAM93HozjB9w	5	2017-01-11 00:00:00	Go on Taco Tuesday for $2 tacos. The meat is always tender and the tacos flavorful. My ultimate favorite though, is their market veggies. Y'all need to order a side of their market veggies - it's not what you'd typically find at your usual restaurant. The veggies are slightly spicy, flavorful, and are melt in your mouth delicious. The market veggies change daily, so come in with an open mind!\n\nThis is my favorite taco shop in Gilbert. You really can't go wrong. True to their name, this place is an absolute joy to go to. \n\nAlso, they have a great happy hour (2-6 pm)!!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	kT58qBMQOHMdzCBu_7Vm7Q	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
kjU771LWxJaH7iuOyUJoWA	4	2014-01-07 00:00:00	This restaurant, like the ones next to it (Postino, Liberty Market, etc.), is super hip. The decor is very bright and California beach house-y. I came here with a few friends, and we had a great time. \n\nFree chips and salsa, and we got two refills while we were there. We also ordered some chicken quesadillas to share. The waiter brought us carne by mistake, but we started eating it anyway, figuring it wasn't a big deal. Then he came by with the chicken, apologizing and saying it was on the house, which was pretty awesome. \n\nThe two orders of quesadillas plus the seemingly endless chips and salsa left me feeling pretty full, but I still managed to eat the two tacos I ordered. One friend ordered a burrito and another ordered the enchiladas. We all thought the food was good, and priced decently for the atmosphere you get.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	bCf0AnUo2N8wO_wfqJXbOg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
kK2SHhoKUi_G4u1fcwIW8w	2	2014-01-31 00:00:00	Been wanting to try Joyride Taco for a while now so took the opportunity to have lunch there.  Bottom line, definitely go for drinks if you're in the area but skip the food.\n\nJoyride and all the other restaurants in downtown Gilbert aren't easy to get to.  Traffic in the area is congested and parking is hard to find... unless you park a block west of everything and the walk from that parking lot is full of dirt/mud/holes/barriers to hurdle.\n\nThe place was about 1/4 full at 1pm on a weekday.  Service was great except for the person who dealt with us most - our waitress.  We waited ten minutes before our drink order was taken, water was never refilled and she left our bill when we weren't even done ordering.  Much of our service was done by other people, though, and they were better than great and phenomenally professional (except for their hiring ability, apparently).\n\nThey brought free chips and salsa, and the salsa was really good.  I'm still not sure about the chips because they seemed house made but were thick like store bought.  The drinks were downright amazing, great beer selection the the cocktails were perfectly balanced and just this side of too strong.  Yes.  I thought the liquor prices were very good for the quality.\n\nMy biggest memory of Joyride was the food, which was so boring.  Everything lacked flavor.  The pork tacos were juicy but had no flavor even with a squeeze of lime, and their tortillas were too soft and just fell apart upon pick-up.  They desperately needed something like cotija or a flavorful crema...salt, even.  The pinto beans were a joke.  No flavor again - they actually tasted just like the Ranch Style Beans my mom used to serve from the black can.  I saw some green flecks that looked like jalapeno but the taste was not there.  This bland food might pass in Chicago but not here.  blecch	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	T9QzRoP0LZYU7yar41Q7ig	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
klFjHGbMbTn0_RYdzH0BXQ	4	2014-01-14 00:00:00	So honey and I wanted a lunch out one fine Sunday afternoon.. so, with our baby in tow, we hit this joint up.  Not busy, so we got seated promptly.. outdoor in their patio area with the great weather.\nOur server guy was great - very friendly, talkative, prompt and gave good recommendations.  I had the spiked Horchata (with Frangelico) and hubby had on-tap beer.\nHis three tacos came out and, unfortunately, I didnt' get a chance to taste them but he appeared to enjoy them as I didn't hear a word otherwise.  My dish, the cochinito pibil torta was SOOO GOOD... that pineapple slaw was a perfect accompaniment and they *perfectly* buttered and toasted the soft, yummy torta the way I would!\nI thoroughly enjoyed that torta and really really liked the horchata.. grainy the way real home-made horchata is.\nI'd definitely come back, though not that regularly as it is a bit pricey for regular eating out for me.	4	0	3	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	ACwN3HGetqPVhAgGKzdnsA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Plus going on $2 Taco Tuesday night even topped my first visit here!  I also tried some of the nachos that my friend ordered and it was very yummy, as well as the 3 tacos that I ordered. The chips and salsa were also great! The waitress was very welcoming and the service was above and beyond! At the end of our meal my friends and I were debating getting dessert, and the waitress paid for our dessert since it was our first time there, how awesome! I will definitely be going back!	1	1	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	xtczVmyVt5Cfqx6PKNvoFQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The decor is nice and has a good size bar.\n\nNow for the food... We tried a few different kinds of tacos the chicken had a nice spice, the beef was a little salty, and the pork was way to sweet. The chips and salsa rocked. Oh did I mention the margaritas... Lol.\n\nAll and all a cool place to hang out have some cocktails/food. We will be back I wish you were just a little bit closer to home.	2	1	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	BqUrMJoa-bXWr2Za3FAtVw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Well let's just say I was not real impressed with the food but the service was really good!  The street tacos weren't terrible but nothing great.  I think Sandbar has better tacos, especially the carnitas.

The fish tacos are delicious, their beet salad is exceptional as well. I wanted to love the tortilla soup but sadly was disappointed with that, but this place is a Taco House, and they do tacos well so that's alright with me! My husband loves their burritos, and their agua frescas are delicious. Get the strawberry one and add Malibu Rum...you won't be disappointed! :) Update: they took all their Ahi Tuna dishes off the menu (appetizers, tacos), which was my favorite thing to order there sometime last year. Haven't been back as frequently and hoping they bring those dishes back! They were awesome!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	ddrRFKCVjvNNGQI6d0cs9Q	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

It was but they have quite alot of seating in/out. The staff was friendly and I saw lots of hustle going on. I had the fish & standard tacos. These are street sized so 3 is a meal and for $1 you can get a side. I didn't do that because I joind the Eposse and received a free appetizer! I had the guacamole which was fresh and tasty with alittle jalapeno kick, excellent.\nMy tacos we also excellent with fresh ingredients and big flavor. If you find yourself in need of a taco fix I recommend Joyride.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	vabOPELZkAWxy9jajB0nhQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I also tried the blood orange marg after seeing it mentioned in several reviews, but I thought it tasted a little soap-y. Thankfully, they were great about swapping it for another coconut one when I told them I wasn't a fan. My friends ordered the house margaritas + they were happy with theirs as well.\n\nTacos were hearty - no skipping on fillings - and we were happy with everything we ordered as far as flavor.\n\nMy one major complaint was the speed of service. We waited a LONG time in between any attention from our server. The manager (I think?) was much more attentive and ended up taking our order, among other things, when our server was missing.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	2XvZxCz2atnBltVgw6liRA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

We had the street corn and the guacamole for starters. Really great my only quibble ( if I have one) would be, it can be a bit tricky cutting the corn off the cob! However it's well worth the wrestle. My hubby had the carnitas taco and the carne asada... I THINK they were delish but.... Someone pigged them all up w/out sharing a bite!!! He said they were GREAT! I had the pork Adabado and the crispy fish (requested corn tortilla rather than flour and they graciously accommodated) they were both amazing! I had a house margarita which was fine but a bit sour... No matter, followed that up w/a kettle one and soda witch was sublime!

kTRUupwby56jLscDALlHjQ	4	2013-06-11 00:00:00	First of all, I need to mention the decor and the ambiance, which hit you as soon as you walk in the door.  It is obvious that a lot of love went into selecting each and every item that went into this restaurant.  My friend and I went for the first time on Sunday, expecting a wait.  We were pleasantly surprised that although relatively small, they have made excellent use of space.  There was both inside and outside seating  available, as well as some very comfy and cool looking bar stools.  We opted to sit at a table inside and we were not disappointed.  We were frequently acknowledged and addressed by a variety of staff members, checking in with us to make sure that we were ok.  Our waiter did a great job of recommending items from the menu, including a few tasty non-alcoholic drinks (**Note, these drinks, at 3.50 a pop are not cheap, and refills will cost you).  I had the Pineapple Agua Fresca and it was really good.  A little on the sweet side, though, and I probably wouldn't  order it again, unless I added alcohol to make it worthwhile (an additional $4.50 to add alcohol).  The chips and salsa are both freshly made.  In fact, our waiter apologized profusely that he could not bring chips to our table immediately because they were still being made.  As we perused the menu, I noted that tacos are sold a la carte.  All sounded delicious, and I opted for one short rib taco ($4) and my friend opted for 2 chicken tinga tacos ($3.50 each).  The waiter explained that a lot of people order 1 or 2 tacos at a time, and then reorder if they are still hungry.  I was definitely still hungry after just one taco, and I was dying to try the carnitas tacos ($3.50 each), but I also wanted to try one of the desserts--"Mo's Definitely" (homemade vanilla pudding, caramel, sliced bananas, salted pecans, and cookie crumbs).  Dessert was $6, so including the 1 taco that I had already eaten, as well as my non-alcoholic, non-refillable beverage, my bill came to almost $14.00.  Definitely not cheap for a "small" dinner that didn't include a side.  My advice to Joyride is to change the menu so that people can choose 2 tacos and include one of your sides and charge about $9.00-10.00.  It would seem like more of a meal and a deal that way.  The way the menu stands now is that you want 2 tacos plus rice and beans, you would be paying about $13.00 or $14.00.  The current menu offers only sides a la carte, ranging in price from $2.50 (rice) to $5 (corn).  I am giving Joy Ride 4 stars, just because I prefer a more "all inclusive" option when eating out, rather than just a pricier a la carte version.  The food is definitely tasty, and the service is great.  I would have given 4 1/2 stars if I could, because at the end of the meal, our waiter presented both my friend and me with a $10 gift card, good for our next visit.  He explained that these gift cards are given to first time customers.  Definitely a classy touch!   We will be back and we will bring our friends :)	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	beNQG4HQ0QnNdjSPh9yq7Q	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
Kvna8-K_B2dAkMlVkViBRA	4	2016-01-30 00:00:00	Update: I'm not going to do an entire review, as I previously reviewed Joyride. Instead, I'm going to update it and review what I think is the more typical experience here. The last visit I had, we waited for way too long to get our receipt, and it really soured an otherwise pleasant visit. This time, the service was very attentive, and we all had a great time. The tacos were all quite tasty, just like the last time. The chicken burrito was excellent. The guacamole is tasty--with chunks, just like I like it.\n\nThe one item that I tried this time that was entirely new was the orange cucumber salad side. It was absolutely fantastic! It had a nice fresh taste to it, and it went great with the other flavors in the meal. Good stuff.\n\nI'm glad that I gave this place another try.\n\nOld review: Pretty tasty food, fun environment, really odd experience overall.\n\nSo this was my first trip to Joyride Taco House, and it was a rather odd experience, service-wise. I'll get to that after mentioning the food first.\n\nThe setting is pretty fun. It's right in the middle of Gilbert's "main street". The big side doors open for a nice open, airy experience. When the weather is nice, it's a perfect setting.\n\nThe chips and salsa came out first. These chips are better than most out there--a little thick, with some good flavor. And the salsa, though not particularly spicy, is really good stuff. My date told me that the guacamole is excellent--I'll have to try it another time.\n\nWe shared the chicken burrito and a couple of tacos--the pork adovada and the chicken. The burrito was excellent! There are a ton of items in that burrito, and the combination of all of them was really good. The sauce provided added some nice extra flavor as well. I must say that quantity-wise, this is a pretty small burrito. If I ordered this as my full meal, I'd probably have been a bit disappointed. Fortunately, I had 2 other tacos. The tacos were decent. The pork was disappointingly bland, though. I'm not sure what happened with it, but it just didn't do it for me. The chicken was really solid. I'll come back to try some of the other tacos.\n\nSo the odd part of the experience. We sat at the table for over 3 hours, and not a single person ever asked us if we wanted our check. Now, this normally would be grounds for a really low rating in my book, but I am considering the situation in its entirety. We were having a lot of fun talking, and that was likely apparent to others. Maybe they were just respecting our having a conversation. But still, not a single person asked us if we wanted our check, and at some point, they seemed to completely forget about us. We'd have left earlier if somebody had come and asked us, but because nobody did and we weren't in a rush, we just kept talking. When we finally had to leave, I walked up to the bar, because we couldn't find our server. A manager saw me and asked me if I wanted the check. So we got it and finally left.\n\nGood food, good setting. And I'll give the service another chance in the future.	0	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	gELwad3XC2fthoffd5Kafg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Beverages were always full and we tried several of his recommendations. I had a couple tacos and the cucumber orange salad, my friend had a burrito. All of the was great.\n\nThe salsa that comes right away is very flavorful and was well enjoyed. Only downside for us (just based on our preferences and sounds super picky) is that the chips are just too thick.\n\nAll in all, great spot for lunch and looking forward to trying more again soon!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	zJyAltBm3BRmjurmi3ylOg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I met a few friends here last night and we sat on the patio.  Drinks and chips were brought out immediately.  We placed our food order and then our server quickly walked away. All of our drinks were empty along with a few of our water glasses. Once we received our food we again had to track down our server to get another round of drinks, including water. After we finished our meal our dirty plates, along with empty chips bowls sat for another good 30 minutes never being picked up until we asked. They have very good margaritas here and all of us would have enjoyed another one....to no avail.  Became more of a job to try to get our servers attention than it was worth.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	QJwXQ9pSc5GbJdyKf4En5Q	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Drinks ranged from good to great. Love the $5 mini-pitchers. I forgot how much I like the San Tan Epicenter, which I used to order from Postino next door.  Some of the cocktails were a little sweet for my liking but they offered good pours. The aguas frescas tasted good too but I had to ask for some extra kick from the not-as-strong liqueurs. Can't say anything about food other than it seemed overpriced. Irrelevant side note: I really enjoyed the wheel knobs on the bathroom sinks.	0	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	v6SrDjzqb3oS6CbHB0xjPw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

lFWHyqumZt5YoUThRXcY6Q	5	2015-09-12 00:00:00	Just went to Joyride with the man friend ;) and we had an AMAZING time. What they have in limited menu selections they make up for in extreme flavor and unexpected flavors (can you say roasted pumpkin seeds??). Their alcohol menu is great with the addition of the agua frescas and their full bar. Billy is an AMAZING server; her "Indian Jones" hat was very "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and not "Temple of Doom". She was very knowledgable about the menu and made our experience great. Hey manager- keep her in mind! You've got a great one on your hands! \n\nThank you, Joyride! We'll definitely be back, hoping to see Billy and her fun attitude and fashion trends. We love you!\n\n-Melissa	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	PO43G64m6f4J7KAWw_LSBQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I got 3 tacos and a side for about $14: chicken,  beef, fish with black beans.  Tacos were street taco size but they jammed it with plenty of meat.   Black beans tasted plain but probably made from scratch.   Also got the almond horchata which was good but didn't get a lot of it since they filled the glass with mostly ice.   For dessert, got the churro with chocolate... If you've never had the real churro from Madrid then it's pretty tasty.  Would I come here again?   Probably just to hang out with friends but not for the food.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	ZNvSWTAsKbu9wKz7WCUnyw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I wanted to take them somewhere nice that is not swarmed with college students. Everywhere was closed at this point or not serving drinks. The manager there opened the kitchen just to make us dinner even though it was last eleven. He was really awesome about it. On top of that he gave us a half off discount. Not only that but the waitress, waiter, and everyone that worked there was super friendly. I have not had service like this on years. The food was also delicious. love this place! Love their food!

No problem, because the Host takes drink orders and there's ample seating to wait.  Busy night overall and a definite hot spot.  Service was great carried by a hosting staff that supports the floor with deliveries, drinks and table turns.  Awesome food. Tacos excellent. Cucumber Serrano Margarita, the bomb.  Can't believe our three year old slept through it all. Note: noise level due to busy dining room and bar.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	KBFQC9xfpMZw7EVE8KkyPg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

lmoxOUQWDw6HL8S6bJU1lQ	3	2015-04-04 00:00:00	My experience here was nothing special. Let's start with the good.\n\nPros\n-Amazing atmosphere \n-Great Margaritas \n-Great Location\n-Outdoor seating\n-Fresh air inside as well\n-Awesome tacos\n-Amazing Happy Hour specials \n\nCons\n-Poor Service by some\n\nUpon arriving, my girlfriend and I were warmly welcomed and sat promptly during what seemed to be a busy time.  They host sat us in a wonderful spot in the restaurant and was very kind. \n\nA young lady who was walking around filling water and occasional light busing table came by to fill our water glasses during this process she spilled more than an acceptable amount of water on our table and walked looked at us and walked away without speaking, apologizing and/or wiping up the spilled water. Them seemed odd as I'm sure I am not the only person who enjoys eating at a dry table.  None the less I waited to see if she was coming back to clean up and noticed that she wasn't  I went ahead and unrolled my silverware and cleaned up the table myself.  \n\nOur waiter arrived and and kindly took our drink order, he was a nice gentleman and returned shortly after with drinks in hand.  Before the waiter left I noticed a hair in my marg and made him aware.  He was great and apologizing and returning promptly with a new one. My girlfriend had the blood orange marg which was amazing.  I had the Joyride which I also that was great, so good that I ordered a second round. We were both very satisfied with our drinks.\n\nWe each order our Tacos, I had the Standard, The Chicken Tinga and the Crispy Fish which our server recommended.  I must say all of the tacos were amazing! Great choices and a great recommendation on behalf of the waiter. \n\nWhile eating the same young lady who was refilling water stopped by and filled our water again, this time not spilling on our table but instead as she walked away spilling on the floor right next to me causing water to splash on my leg.  At this point I am laughing out of disbelief of her carelessness and poor demeanor as she works.  She has yet to smile and/or speak.  Luckily this was our last experience with this individual. \n\nWhen the check came I was surprised to see our bill for 3 margs, and 5 tacos was so cheap. \n\nWorking in the service industry I know tips are a way of showing your appreciation for great service.  I refused to allow the hair in my marg and the careless water lady affect our service good service and left around a 30% tip after factoring in the discount given due to happy hour.  I wish I could remember his name so I could shout him out and let him know I appreciate his service.  \n\nHopefully he along with the hostess will rub off on the others in the restaurant.  Just because you aren't designated to serving others doesn't mean you are excused from working with a smile on your face and putting effort into your work.\n\nI am in no rush to comeback...	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	z9Mf41VHEKZ4Mii8WNW8-w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
LObDO667cFeYudh7KpU37w	4	2015-01-08 00:00:00	First off I would like to say if you haven't been to downtown Gilbert in a while you need to. It has become a hip little restaurant row.  A few years ago I moved away from Arizona to foodie heaven a.k.a. Portland, OR. Being from Arizona originally I would have to say that the one thing Portland cannot seem to replicate correctly is Mexican food. So coming back to visit tacos are an essential must eat. \nA friend suggested we head over to Joyride Tacos and I'm sure glad she did. Every sip and bite was delicious! They had both a front and back patio with plenty of seating. Being a beautiful sunny, 70 degree day we choose to sit out front. While I was waiting for my guest, the waiter promptly brought out chips and salsa, then took my drink order. They have about 6 aqua frescas to choose from which you can get with or without alcohol. I choose the almond horchata, oh man was it good! They serve it with a little bit of ground cinnamon sugar and nuts on top and that gives it an amazing texture. The chips were crisp and tasted like they had been fried fresh that morning. The salsa was spicy yet fresh. So don't be afraid to dig in just because you can't handle heat. When my friend arrived we ordered a couple tacos each. I got both a chicken and shredded beef taco, both came with and assortment of cheese and veggies on top, including avocado. I ate my chicken taco first which was very tasty, but the beef taco was by far superb. You could literally taste the smokey goodness in every bite of the taco and the creamy avocado was a perfect accent to the meat. Oh and because the two of us ordered more then 3 tacos we received a free side dish! We choose the black beans and they were better then any black beans I have ever had before. Overall I will be heading back to Joyride Tacos at least once every trip back to AZ!	0	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	yb1wul44DdvuW48FG9UQ9g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

LQLjdmF4Ph9gln819ZCnmQ	3	2013-06-12 00:00:00	I've always wondered why the empty space next to Postinos East wasn't occupied by something and now finally I got my wish.  From the "Owners" of Postinos,  the Upwards Project, have rolled out another concept restaurant/bar.  This time its a taco shop. I love everything from the UP especially Postinos and I love Mexican food so I was very excited for this new place.  How can go wrong right?  \n\nThe Good\n-You can expect the attentative service you've expected from Postinos with LOTS of servers always checking up on you.  And of course all the servers are attractive and easy on the eyes.  \n-The décor is always interesting, a mix between modern, with southwest, but more Texas southwest as opposed to Mexican southwest.  But never the less its also easy on the eyes. \n-The food is FRESSSSH and taste like everything is made from scratch.  After eating a few tacos you don't get that greasy, heavy, guilty feeling as you would elsewhere.  It seems like every item on the menu was created individually with its own recipe and taste.  No 2 tacos taste the same so you'll definitely have to try them all out.\n-The seafood is def the highlight of the place.  Esp the scallop.  Scallop ceviche is good and the scallop taco is fab.  The fish tacos are great too, especially the battered crispy one.\n-Ok so I lied, the drinks are the highlight of the place.  They have a good sized list of specialty drinks that they created themselves.  But not so long that its intimidating (that's what she said).  I like that its just not a Mexican restaurant and their only drinks are margaritas. They have a really good variety and they all taste good.  The drinks would be the only reason to come back\n-They have a nice chill "patio"/outdoor that you can go and just hangout and drink on\n\nThe Bad\n-Although every taco has it individual taste, that doesn't mean each taste is good. there are some taste and combinations that really just make you wonder.  Esp the chicken tacos.  \n-although the seafood tacos are great, the regular meat is just ok.  I've been all around AZ eating all types of Mexican food and i'd like to consider myself an expert of tasting tasty tacos and Joyride's non-seafood tacos are deff a lackluster.  They just don't have the same taste, the flavor, the 'OOOOOMMMPH" as others. The carne asada, the chicken, and the pork (carnitas)\n-They have 6 different salsas, however only one of them is hot/spicy.  However the Spicy gradient is steep, we're talking tomato sauce to "melt your face off".  But no in betweens\n-The music is def like that of a bar.  American 80s,90s and some contemp rock.  Isnt this a taco shop, atleast some Mexican music, you can even do Spanish rock. \n-The ambiance is LOUD, like El Hefe loud but with more hipsters and less Dbags. If you want to have a quiet conversation, def sit outside or go next door to postinos\n\nThe Ugly\n-Everything here is expensive. $4 is the average price of ONE taco. Yes one taco.  The scallop is MKT price so you don't know what it is.  Although they are big and thoughtfully made. $4 is much. \n-They charge extra for salsa.  EXTRA FOR SALSA WHAT?  most Mexican places have a Salsa bar that you can choose from for FREE.  Its $2 for a small bowl of salsa.  \n\nPros:\n-Great seafood tacos\n-GREAT drinks specialties\n-great atmosphere\n\nCon\n-very Americanize that its barely Mexican\n-EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE. $4 per taco, $2 for salsa, $12 for ceviche\n-loud and borderline El Hefe like....(shudders)\n\nI would def come here to grab drinks and chill out on the patio but that's about it...	6	1	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	TxkOmAlrA8yUls-_YSkpJg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
LR9dJ88KNt9PvebKh1Kd6w	4	2014-01-19 00:00:00	Wowzers! This place's food is Rock&Roll in your mouth. Great service and great ambiance. The food is obviously prepared with fresh ingredients and you can tell. The meats they use in their tacos are slow cooked to perfection with love. Small portions on the street tacos and higher then expected price point but satisfied nonetheless. \n\nMy only mark down comes from when we requested some cucumber slices instead of chips for the salsa. The cucumbers they delivered had mold on them. They were very apologetic; however, it should have been noticed (appeared the cucumbers came from the bar not the kitchen). Not to take anything away from their chips as they were really good and salsa outstanding.	1	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	2u5zHDck7j4V1dpw1lUnuQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

LvuSWdvoqzD-yflJsKTbEQ	5	2014-06-30 00:00:00	So my boyfriend and I ventured here for some prime time World Cup viewing as well as  some delicious noms (or food, if you will).\n\nFirst thing's first. This place has the coolest atmosphere  ever (As far as restaurants go). Complete with laid back tunage and retro decor, I was instantly enamored. The smell that emerges from the kitchen is also to die for. Did I mention that they have a weekend happy hour that includes alcoholic agua frescas as well as local pitchers of beer? My goodness... could it get any better...\n\nThe food options are plentiful and everything is extremely fresh. I can't even begin to describe to you the wonderful appeal to the senses that each bite provides. My boyfriend ordered a make your own type of burrito and I ordered the chicken.  (Which sounds plain and boring but is anything but!) Inside the chicken burrito was butternut and chayote squash, spinach, mushroom, avocado, corn, queso, tomatillo salsa, pico gringo and aji amarillo. (i'm salivating just remembering it!) I also washed it down with an ice cold glass of some Four Peaks.... \n\nOverall, if you aren't in the area, this place is worth the drive. Devine food, amazing customer service, and extreme satisfaction all around. I will DEFINITELY be coming back.	3	2	2	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	nBjW8OJu4Juvbs5gldHhwg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Salsa is mushed up with who knows what.  Everything on the menu is so discrimintive.  Why GRINGO?  or is this place is only for whites.  I wouldnt eat here ever.  If you want good street tacos, go to a real mexican resturant, at least youll get sides with it and real food.  If there were a choice on the star, I would not even give one.  Horrible.  never eat at joy ride again.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	B_foe588V7u-VmXuQcJs0w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Our food came fast and was hot. We ordered the standard chicken tacos. Other wise it wasnt too spicy. Since it was happy hour they were only $2.00 each. They were tiny, but surprisingly filling. The atmosphere was similar to the breakfast place next door. It was loud and almost had to yell across the table just to have a conversation. Desert menu only offered three items. We didnt see any desert we liked so went to another restaurant nearby for desert. Other than that I would recommend this place if you are looking for something quick and tasty.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	i6VCUFp3babV3lrl_j_52w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

m9jGh5JeufC96FeYd7SfUA	2	2016-11-16 00:00:00	I'll start off with the horrible seating process which starts off with a 45min wait for NO reason. We arrived on a Friday night about 7:30pm and had a seat at the bar until a table was ready. As we looked around, there was easily 6 tables and a booth available for patrons. The hostesses just keep chatting amongst themselves and then they'd call all seven parties at once causing a huge cluster at the front. You'd think they would keep the flow moving and sit parties as guests leave? My biggest gripe was that they nickel and dime you for literally everything! You are limited to one basket of free chips and salsa then you are charged for more- want hotter salsa... upcharge of $3! Want more red sauce on the burrito you already paid an upcharge on for enchilada style... $3 more! I was super disappointed with the burrito which was very dry. I'll admit the black beans and cheese y mas appetizer were amazing though. Add in the horrible parking situation and I won't be back.	2	2	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	-tQ3UVVdNBZBR_HOVFROzw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
mAIElD2_SIkaZSDumsKugw	3	2015-01-21 00:00:00	I have been to this location of Joyride a couple times now.\n\nIt is super cute and I love the decor.  \n\nCurrently there is construction next door for a new breakfast place, so there is no more "play area" outdoors to chillax.  Still, they have tables outside.  I was seated there on my most recent visit.\n\nI love their chips and salsa and could eat it all day long.\n\nI've ordered a few different entrees and tacos from Joyride.  They were all pretty good.  On the most recent visit, I ordered a Garden Variety veggie burrito ($8)  sans the white magic (as it contains egg).  It was actually really good.  \n\nHowever, I have to say that the food is inconsistent in that the entrees have all been pretty good, but the sides and soup are just plain boring.\n\nI ordered the pinto beans on my last visit ($3) and ate two bites of the dish.  They seemed to lack any flavor and could have used, at the very least, some salt and pepper.  On a previous visit I ordered a bowl of the tortilla soup ($6).  It tasted like chicken noodle, at best.  It was not good and I sent it back (which I never do).  My dining companion ordered a side of "The Bomb black beans" and he only ate a few bites, when he normally inhales them.  I noticed a guy at a table in front of us ordered the side of rice.  I observed the guy ate one bite and left the rice untouched after that. \n\nMy daughter ordered the kid's meal nachos, which had some sort of fondue-like melted cheese on top.  The chips looked good, but she had fewer than ten nachos on her plate.  It came with milk and a side of some cut up fruit.  The tray had a place for another side and I think it should have had beans or something in addition for the $5 they charge.  Still, it would have been fine if my daughter would have eaten all the nachos. Unfortunately, we were seated under a tree and leaves kept falling into her food.  She refused to eat the food, even after I removed the leaves.  Unfortunately, we did not see our waitress often and it was too inconvenient to be moved at that point.  I would  ask to be reseated if the tree still had leaves (on a subsequent visit).  \n\nIf Joyride had more "zippy" or exciting sides, they'd have a loyal customer.  It's too darn bad they can't get better beans going.  I am still thinking about how good the veggie burrito is, but I won't be back unless someone else drags me.	4	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	_jjbwHWLFA5GjWFWGLj4ZQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
mdvx1ByuVGa8IrvIzOsAHg	2	2016-06-26 00:00:00	I was there today with my 4 year old daughter, and it once again reaffirmed the fact that this place is way over-rated. Their food is good (not great) and is seemingly overpriced. \n\nLuckily today, being mid afternoon on a Sunday, there was absolutely no wait. There was plenty of seating inside and outside. Considering it was not extremely busy, it seemed less of an excuse to receive absolutely crappy service. \n\nWe probably waited 10-15 minutes to get a drink order, and by that time my daughter was getting restless. We ordered drinks and our meals, and it came out rather quickly. The server gave my daughter the wrong drink and then messed up her order. Ok, not a huge deal. \n\nMy daughter was getting tired so I was holding her, and I asked for boxes to take my food home. He gave me the boxes and the check and then leaves. Someone with some common sense would've at least offered to help me with the food and the boxes considering I was holding my child. As I'm leaving, no "thank you" or "have a good day" (not even from the hostess as we were walking out the front door.) I probably will not go back there again.	3	2	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	NZ75J8fzTU4fbJKecWcEUA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
Me4LISK62L68c1my9DNfVw	3	2014-02-03 00:00:00	Went on a Saturday for an early dinner.  Service was great, waitress was friendly, we were seated right away.  We also moved tables because our location was too loud for me and they had no problem with that. Living in Phoenix, I feel like we have lots of great food options here and I would say that their food was a bit pricey and tasted good.  Not great, not awesome, just good and that is fine.  The chips and salsa were great (probably best part).  We also ordered the fish taco (husband said that was good) and the carne asada burrito (that was ok).  Also got the vanilla custard pudding for dessert (very interesting, not my fave).  So, I guess I was expecting awesome since lots of people have eaten there and suggested it to us, but I thought it was average.  I do love the ambiance, though and the outdoor seating area is great.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	s5qUNVLU6S-9O-y00HU5bw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The $5 margaritas and pitchers for happy hour are a great deal, that's even before you get to the food. Had tacos, queso and burritos and they were all top notch. The place has a great vibe. We might be back for a third round later this week! Service was friendly and prompt both times we went.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	aKKKwUtY_pDv9jAtacYmdA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

MfuLB-BjtATHvEemct-rOg	4	2014-07-02 00:00:00	We ended up walking here because Postino's next door had a 45 minute wait on a Sunday afternoon. And boy, am I glad we did. We ordered the chicken nachos, 3 different tacos. My favorite was the braised beef taco. To drink we had their blood orange margarita, which was phenomenal. \n\nOnly downside is that I couldn't ell who worked there and who didn't. The waiters do not use uniforms or even the same colors. I think the manager was our waiter and he had a Batman shirt on.	1	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	0OnkIv2xvupcPOEudP98aQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

They did not care for the tacos that had beans mixed in them. We ordered the standard, carne asada, and the fried fish tacos. The tacos were ok along with the Mexican cold slaw. I think I was looking for more of a Mexican taste. The food is healthy but just not for was. The place was nice to try...	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	eknUvkD79RXaNAyuXKEQsw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

mg6k5pNVY7Nr7U0bAmr5MA	4	2013-11-19 00:00:00	Finally was able to go to Joyride on a lunch date and give it a try.  After many good recommendations and reviews, I would have to say this place met and exceeded expectations.\n\nThe chips and salsa were phenomenal.  The chips were fresh and crispy, but didn't taste like the other paper thin generic chips served at other chain establishments.  The salsa was also very fresh and flavorful, and had a great kick to it.  It was a little spicy for my wife though, which is not necessarily a good thing.\n\nI ordered a quesadilla and my wife ordered a few tacos and we split the meals.  We only finished about half the quesadilla and had half a taco left after we were both stuffed.  The food was great!  Great flavors and awesome presentation.  I wasn't surprised at food or service based on reviews and will be returning here to enjoy another lunch or dinner soon.  \n\nThe staff was very friendly and the service was excellent.  It looked like a replica staff of the one at Postino.  I'm not sure when Gilbert suffered a hipster movement, but apparently this historic Downtown Gilbert area is attractive to the new age hippy as a place of employment.  Regardless, the staff was pretty good and service was above average. \n\nJoyride would be a great Saturday afternoon spot to have a couple of drinks and some tacos and I would highly recommend this place.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	5aheyAtMObm5SUaeBpxZ6g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
ML9iRt1d8IWp7T3lDHhTvw	5	2013-10-21 00:00:00	Had the pleasure is dining at Joyride. We decided to take a bike ride into town for dinner. Love the open air restaurant. We chose 3 different types of tacos. The standard, the beef and the shrimp. The shrimp was my favorite the other were delicious. For desert we had the el Domingo. A unique dessert!! It was great. To top off our evening when we got to out bikes there was a coupon thanking us for riding in and we now can go back for 3 free tacos. What a great perk!! It was worth the 6 miles we rode and the extra perk made our night even better.	1	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	V1mOmLiiEqMUmkEyDskJ6A	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

MLqUqfX6_RU00ruQ50rAzA	5	2015-05-26 00:00:00	Seen this place on yelp and wanted to try something new in a new area since we barely came across downtown Gilbert today. (we are not from AZ) Cute little town area. We were greeted as we walked in, we sat outside in the open patio. The area they had for patio was cute with the hanging candles and lights.  Our waiter Clark, he was really nice and gave us great recommendations that we ended up trying. We ordered the Fila Ensalda (something like that) which is a really flavorful salad. I ordered the almond horchata with no booze, it was tasty. I also ordered the three tacos and get one side. The braised beef, shrimp , and Baja fish taco with the Mexican slaw as the side. \nIt's not authentic Mexican food but it is all very good food. I love the edgy atmosphere. \n\nRating: \nQuality: 5/5\nPresentation: 5/5\nService: 5/5 (came to check on us multiple times) \nCleanliness: 5/5 \n\nI do wish they would have more dessert choices though.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	9Dd1fLx93JRGypYC_3i9Zw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
mmKYUzt1LDtO5ZvaW-unng	4	2015-07-31 00:00:00	Yummo! Went around 6:45 on a Thursday and had a 25 min. wait to eat inside (outside was no wait). You can use the No Wait app on your phone to make it even easier. A kind gentleman offered us water while we waited outside by the misters. They sent a text once our table was ready. We were at a four top near the bar in really cool looking, comfortable chairs. Immediately, our server, Allie, greeted us and we were given warm chips and salsa. We liked the chips but found the salsa to be mediocre. The decor was neat, kinda hipster with funky wallpaper and multi-colored chairs. The bar area is pretty big with cool lights hanging down. Those were pretty much the only lights because it was super dark and loud inside. \n\nWe ordered:\n-Street corn\n-Nachos with chicken\n-Carnitas taco\n-standard (chicken) taco \n-crispy fish taco\n-cucumber orange salad (as side that comes with 3 tacos)\n\nThe corn was brought before the rest of our food with a knife to cut it off the cob. The best street corn I have ever had and the large cob slathered in cojita cheese and spices was well worth the $5. Get this! Hubby liked his nachos, especially the addition of magic white sauce. He did feel that the addition of chicken was overpriced for what he received. \n\nTo try a variety, I ordered the three tacos and cucumber salad. They forgot to bring fish taco and the salad with my meal but this was quickly remedied. The salad side was great-vinegar based and refreshing. The standard taco was not very good and lacked any flavor. The carnitas was pretty good but again, could have used a touch more salt or sauce. The crispy fish taco was great and the ingredients added all the necessary textures to make each bite mouth watering. Even though they are small, I found the tacos to be filling.\n\nWe will definitely be back on a Tuesday to get $2 tacos and $5 margaritas. The prickly pear and watermelon versions looked fabulous. For all that we ate, our bill was only $32. Great date night meal and we are excited to have tried this out. Park in the large free lot off of Page to avoid parking headache. Now go get your taco on! \n-	3	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	7p1FfxnjZAuNydjLKEW_Yg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Located in downtown Gilbert right next to a ton of free parking. The only downside is very loud 80s music blasting throughout making it a little difficult to have a conversation.  Otherwise a great place to have an excellent meal.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	9jsBpPA-1h6ZPxxm01Za-w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
MQATiwyRAwKZRATOn0S5Qg	4	2016-04-20 00:00:00	Did a fast lunch here. Not too bad but a bit pricy for 2 tacos, 1/2 salad and an iced tea. $14  It all was good including salsa and chips. For this price I would expect at least 3 tacos or larger than the street taco sized tacos they did serve. No doubt you're paying for decorum and location more so than food. Not bad but not great.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	IDXdWqBF85LkusxIAZ1p8g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

mXFj413-VF84Aa-we9qC6w	4	2013-06-05 00:00:00	I have yet to meet an Upwards Project establishment that I didn't like!  \n\nThe decor is awesome. Hip and comfortable. The outside patio chairs look uncomfortable but are. The chairs inside look comfy too.  The patio has misters- and you don't get soaked!!   \n\nThe menu is simple. Tacos, burritos, sides, desserts, and a nice drink menu. As any good restaurant should, they brought out complimentary chips and salsa. Very tasty!  Chips were nice and crispy!  I had the chicken burrito.  My only complaint was the menu did not specify mushrooms were in it. It only mentioned a garden variety mix. Luckily they were huge chunks so easy to remove!  I also had the Mexican corn. If you like cheese, you'll love this.  Cheese was all I could taste. $5 for a piece of corn was a bit much, so between that and the fact the food does not come with a side (no rice or beans?).  This is the only reason for 4 stars instead of 5.  The food was excellent though.  We also shared dessert. The Mo's Definitely was good, and I can't wait to go back and try the others. \n\nThe drinks were great too!  I had the Mexican Mule. Nice for a warm summer day out on the patio. My friend had a blood orange margarita, that was good too!\n\nFinally, I have to comment on the service. We went on opening day (6/4) and I expected slow, quirky service. Nope!  Other than the fact our server thought the corn came with 2 cobs, which he quickly corrected himself on, he knew the menu, made great recommendations, had out stuff out to us fast and brought exactly what we ordered. All of the staff there were very friendly, smiling, always checking up on us and refilling water. You'd never know they just opened, no opening day kinks that I could see.\n\nThis is a great addition to the area, I can't wait to go back and taste more of the menu!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	g0ZD0WQbavVdhAC_Qfb3Iw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

First impression was that it was too dark, I had to shine my phone onto the menu to be able to read it.  Then the real issues started with the service being the biggest one.  Took a good twenty minutes to order and then an eternity to get my tacos.  They were okay, nothing great though.  Server came by one to all if o wanted a refill however never brought it out.  Between the mediocre food and terrible service I don't think I'll go back.	1	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	tq0n8Szz3RHnXqqjSH2klw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

n06CkfZCTkNYPLBmM2eHHg	5	2013-06-17 00:00:00	When my boyfriend and I first heard about Joyride Taco House, we decided that the next time we had a taste for fresh Mexican, we were making it our destination - which is what we did last night.\n\nWhen we walked in, we were seated right away. Iced water, chips & salsa were brought to our table immediately. We had a server and then some!  Throughout the night, all of the servers helped each another!! Every server that walked by our table either filled our water glasses, offered to get us a drink, picked up dishes, asked if there was anything we needed, etc.  At the sake of sounding like a cheesy cliche, the place ran like a well-oiled machine - but a personable, outgoing, happy well-oiled machine! I've never experienced anything like it, I was almost dumbfounded, but very pleased.  The way the servers - from bar staff to kitchen staff to floor staff - worked together, had a positive effect on the atmosphere of the whole restaurant. I would go back for that alone. But we were hungry and were anxious to try the food as well! \n\nNext in my review: The decor!  Retro! Bright and clean with very comfy chairs. The bathrooms are spacious, private and spotlessly clean. I laughed and told my boyfriend about not wanting to come back out into the restaurant because the ambiance of the bathroom made me want to stay in there and meditate. haha  \n\nBefore looking at the menu, we ordered drinks. I had a Classic Margarita, and after tasting a couple beers, my boyfriend had a small pitcher of beer. Their Happy Hour prices made us happy.  \n\nNow, the food! The food was excellent, but of course, we could only eat so much, so we'll have to come back until we've tried it all!  I had the Veggie & Goat Cheese Enchilada. It came covered half in a green salsa sauce and half in a brown (mole-type) sauce.  The fresh veggies inside the Enchilada were chopped into bite sized pieces, and tasted delicious. The brown sauce was very spicy/hot for my taste. A server offered some Crème fraîche to tone down the heat, which definitely helped. (I would suggest that the menu states that the brown sauce is hot OR that the server states the fact, offering the option for only the green sauce.)  I loved the Enchilada and next time will have it with just the green sauce. My boyfriend had beef tamales that came with rice and beans - and not a drop was left on his plate. Everything from the chips & salsa, to our entrés tasted fresh and delicious.\n\nFrom our first visit/experience, we were very impressed and will come back  to try other items on the menu - and/or Happy Hour appetizers and drinks at the bar. They do have an outdoor patio with misters, which we would be willing to try on summer nights.  \n\nGood job, Owner & Manger!  \n\nI wanted to leave this part out of the main review. If there is ONE thing I would offer as a possible change, it would  be this:  The servers are allowed casual dress, which I like, and adds to the casual, relaxed atmosphere of the place. I would only suggest that there be something that stands the servers apart from the customers - such as all black shirts  OR Hawaiian shirts OR something similar for the men - and maybe all black  or black & white attire for the women?    It really doesn't take long to figure out who the servers are - they are the ones who are constantly on the move and taking care of every customer in the place.  Keeping a casual dress style for the servers with some kind of consistent theme is only a suggestion.  We love Joyride Taco House and we will be back!\n\n//////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n\nUpdate: CELIACS BEWARE: Although Joyride Taco House may have "gluten free" options, until they have a separate station for preparing and cooking gluten-free foods, all foods may be cross contaminated by gluten.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	xXgFuqpm6eaCI4QB6E4huQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

From tasty unique cocktails to authentic and delicious street tacos and street corn, we we very pleased. Many restaurants in the Heritage District are busy on Saturday night at 7pm, but we found seats quickly at the bar and didn't mind. I am guessing a little earlier would have garnered us a table.

ndWQXEOn10BLLBZMbLYa7A	3	2016-06-01 00:00:00	I was here on a short trip and my friend took me and my mom here to eat. I really like tacos and being in the southwest, I expected great things. \n\nI was kind of hungry, so I decided to try the beast burrito and my mom got some fish tacos. The burrito was good, but it just wasn't what I was expecting, like something was off. Maybe it was that it didn't taste as authentic to me. The tacos also weren't bad, but again, something was off to me. I thought it was slightly overpriced for what we got, since I was expecting more, but I wouldn't mind trying this place again given the right conditions.	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	hM3oEy9HoC_uQExSdwUysg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

It was probably because Hector scored the offending vegetable from America's Taco Shop, which has an embarrassingly bad rendition of this barrio sensation.\n\nI shall be known as the "Get That Corn Inta My Face!" guy, after ordering elote from the Joyride app offering.  I am the Albexican, and know good corn Mexican.  Yeah that rhymed, I do it all the timed!\n\nAnother win for the vegetarians comes in the Garden Variety Burrito, enchilada style... sawed in half, with competing red and green sauces covering each dismemberment.  Snicker's could never satisfy like this\n\nLil tip... when you order, say, a... pineapple auga fresca... drink it quickly.  If you let it sit, the ice will melt, and you'll end up with a watered down agua fresca... and your heart will be sad.\n\nFinally, and potentially the most important aspect (depending on if you're actively on laxatives or not)... the bathroom scene.  Let's taco bout it.\n\nThere's three doors.  Choose wisely, don't doddle.\n\n1. Guys & Gals (The most spacious of the three.  Like driving a Chevrolet Cordova)\n2.

The tacos are great, but seem a bit small, especially when they're full price ($3.50-$4.50). Although, the sides are huge and hearty! Your pocketbook will thank you if you come in when the tacos are $2 though. They really do have great service here, everyone was eager to help us. No one said "this isn't my section/table/job".

We expected a little more food based on the price. The tacos here are pretty small. The taco was good but too watery (don't know what that juice was dripping all over my plate). Chips are ok, salsa ok. When I compare what I get from the popular local fast food fish taco place and other Mexican restaurants I have to wonder if this business plan will work.\n\nQuality is ok. Too expensive for what you get. I don't mind spending the money if I feel I am getting my money's worth.

The restaurant is situated in Downtown Gilbert next to other fantastic restaurants. My biggest thank you to the owner and chef goes to the portion and flavor. In an environment of over sized American gluttony this place provides the "right" size for an entree. I ordered 3 tacos, Chicken, Pork and Carne Asada with a side of Black beans... I was very satisfied. The Salsa was AMAZING and helped round out the meal. Overall a strong contender for an evening out, happy hour or even with the kids!	0	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	OH2V4pjngfcJjNDRa9YoaQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Service varies from good to kind of slow, but I think the food speaks for itself as it's tasty and well made. I definitely recommend a (spiked!) agua fresca.The lolo grain salad is an excellent choice if you're trying to go meatless. I think there's better tacos in the valley, but they're solid and will fill you up for a decent price. Don't skip dessert! Get an order of churros and let your taste buds walk through fried cinnamon heaven.	3	2	2	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	CEoMgtYwcskmU6VOeDAwVw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

There is music playing and after awhile it starts to get a little loud.  The place was busy on a Thursday night.  The whole area was busy, gilbert is making their own little busy down town.\n\nThe food I give a 1 star.  The taste was ok but for the price it should have been better.  The beef had some fatty stuff.  The chicken and pork was ok.  The waitress bragged about the tacos and that they made the tortillas in house.  The tortillas were soft on the inside and edges were dehydrated.  The horchata was not that great, too much cinnamon. \n\nThe bill for 2 of us was $40 which i thought was over priced.   I will not be going back.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	MPZ8NPVUEucGCbEGUfTmhA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Happy hour is from 3PM-5PM and that makes my wallet and me pleased.  You can get tacos for $2 a pop, nachos for $6, and $5 margaritas.  They also serve beer too.\n\nFood is great, location is amazing, and the staff is friendly.  Sit at the bar for the best service imaginable and check out all their nerdy artwork.

That said they have a decent 70's - 90's mix running on the night I was there. \n\nThe chips and salsa were very good. Crispy chips and spicy salsa. My wife doesn't like it hot and they gave her tomatillo which was also delicious. \n\nShe got a fish taco plus two chicken tacos. She liked hers and thought they were solid. I got the taco platter (spicy chicken, carnitas and carne asada. The asada was basically charbroiled and in would have preferred the pork and chicken to be more unique meat ingredients versus stews. The beans and rice we both fine and avacado ripe. The blood orange margarita was the bomb so that helped everything! \n\nI would go back and try some more street tacos and maybe a burrito and definitely sample the other margaritas.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	qc996UZf1UakNuzfYlw2Vg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

nysy_2rK80rpcMy6q8IbfQ	2	2016-06-25 00:00:00	Visited this place soon after it opened on the recommendation of a friend. What a surprise! And not a good one. The carne tacos were waay expensive. $3.75 PER TACO! Traveled extensively to most all regions of Mexico, so I've seen many variations on the theme of ,"Tacos." These were some version of "Caucasian Tacos." The Carne had a slightly sweet flavor like the got the meat from Joe's BBQ. Tortillas were soft and pretty good. Many flavors of iced tea. Not saying that is good or bad, but hey. Focus on one good one and stick with it.The place was pretty trendy and reminded me of what a taco shop at the Biltmore would look like. But it was clean and pleasing. Crowd was full of locals with "Man Buns." Urban chic I guess. I sat at the bar, and it smelled like a bar. No big deal. Took a while for uno taco, so when it did arrive, I jumped right in. Didn't notice a salsa bar. Like I said, slightly sweet flavor, not what I was looking for, as I was looking for AUTHENTIC. And I was honest when the waiter came and asked me how it was. Sat and enjoyed the view and finished my tea. When I asked for the check, the guy said that it was comped, and he was sorry for the dis-appointing taco. I graciously thanked him and left Almost the total bill for a tip. And for it's popularity. I guess it's not the authenticity that people come here for. And that's ok too.	0	1	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	m92Eef1JfUpN8RyibPXh9w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The area is ideal if you're out and about in Downtown Gilbert. It is super close to the galleries and other attractions in the area. Watch yourself on the salsas. We asked for the hottest one they had and they charged for it. Granted the menu says that but we had just sat down and hadn't gotten to the menu. It wasn't worth the extra money.

O9vfERur2wxz_Nhcz5ZoYQ	4	2017-05-31 00:00:00	Street tacos + hipster vibe = super popular place \nDid it live up to the hype? Weeelll, it was good but not great. The restaurant itself and the service partially make up for the food (more on that later). The decor and ambiance are fun. The wait staff was very nice and extremely prompt in their service: taking our orders, refilling drinks, bringing the check, etc. That's especially impressive as we went on Taco Tuesday when it's supposedly busier. We got there around 5 and were seated immediately. They were still seating immediately at 5:45 when we left. \n\nThe music was too loud, though at least it wasn't terrible music. The main issue is that with the music that loud, you almost have to yell to be heard by your dinner companions, which makes the restaurant twice as loud. I will never understand why restaurants think you come to listen to their mundane background music. If it's a live band, okay. Otherwise, you obviously want to talk to (not shout at) whomever you're having dinner with. (Rant concluded.)\n\nAs for the food, they're small street tacos in thick, almost pita-thickness, flour tortillas. The Standard was the best of the four we tried. It was pretty good, but not amazing. The Carnitas was good once we divested it of all the fatty gristle, but it seems like they don't choose their meat for that particularly well. All-in-all, I've had better tacos for a cheaper price. Still, I was okay with paying $2 apiece for these, but I would not pay any more than that (so only going during happy hour or on Tuesdays). We also had the churros with chocolate dipping sauce--that was very good. Nice quality churros and creamy delicious chocolate. So a very nice dining experience (5 stars) + not bad food (3 stars) = 4 stars overall	2	1	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	OpGconLgMVeIHYagzq1EJg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Of0OU3jdJUmoQ8FjChFe2g	2	2014-10-29 00:00:00	Joyride is overpriced Mexican food, and doesn't even have as much flavor as many of their less expensive competitors in the east valley. Tacos the size of my wife's palm should not be $4.50 each, especially considering the unimpressive flavors (of the shrimp and crispy fish). The "Mexican coleslaw" tasted like regular coleslaw and was a dripping wet addition to a lackluster taco. The lunch special ordered was $9.75 for two tiny tacos, and a bowl of soup. Chips and salsa are complimentary but I felt the salsa was overwhelmed by onions. \n\nThe tortilla soup was good, I do admit, and is the only thing I'd go back for. The service at lunch was attentive and they have an extensive bar menu, so I believe the target audience is for hipsters having a night out, rather than those looking for a delicious and filling meal.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	KyCJW_tKT7jpAyc7vjZ_Dw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The decor is fun and trendy and they play great music. It is a fantastic place to just relax and grab a bite with friends. The staff are all friendly and the customer service is great. They're quick to refill your drinks and if anything is wrong with your order (only happened to us once, forgot the enchilada sauce on a burrito) they are quick to fix it. \n\nWe ordered a taco trio (carne asada, chicken tinga, & Baja fish) they were all fantastic but the carne asada was by far the favorite. The bomb black beans that came with the tacos were amazing! Seriously, for something as simple as black beans they were so tasty. My husband got The Beast burrito enchilada style with red and green sauce. That was delicious too. The Pork Adobado Torta was absolutely amazing! Makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The toasted bread was perfect with the saucy meat and the side salad that came with it was a perfect light complement to the heaviness of the sandwich. \n\nAll in all, an awesome place, can't say enough great things about it! Can't wait to go back and try something new.

We have been here half a dozen times and every time it's been stellar!  If you order tacos in a group they bring them all out together which can be complicated.

Op4gQruFgN6WLYf-Xfbirw	3	2014-06-14 00:00:00	I really wanted to like this place, but I was disappointed after the first sip of the "almond horchata". The atmosphere is trendy and cool, but the food is a tad over priced and isn't worth the hype. My drink was literally hard to swallow- it was very powdery and chalky. Totally not worth the $8! I ordered the crispy fish taco which had no flavor, the braised beef taco was flavorful but the cochinita pibil made me give this rating an extra star. It was delicious! Also the salsa is very fresh and had the perfect amount of heat. The tacos are small so I feel like paying almost $4 for one is a rip off! I'm glad that I tried it but probably won't be going back. The fresh salsa and cochinita pibil tacos really are the reason for the 3 stars.	4	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	yGrseFVHW9ZD7IPVJ4JjnA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
OPiPLy5RIOCRSi11Wn8WYA	2	2014-11-13 00:00:00	I love love love the ambiance of the restaurant. It is fun and funky, great youth for Gilbert! The margaritas are great and you can't really mess up chips and salsa!\n\nHaving worked in restaurants for 6 years, I have probably sent food back less than 5 times in my life. Joyride would be one of those times. Very bland carne asada. Management was great in offering me something else and giving me coupons for my next visit - I really appreciate the customer service. \n\nSo basically, I will go back, but I will stick to drinks and apps :)	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	8Nx6sOzzyU0DIERjcS6shw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
OpuhNU5vlrJdSWdpoASXSA	3	2014-06-05 00:00:00	First off, the food was very good and deserves four stars. The problem was the service. The server was constantly forgetting to bring us things we had asked so we had to ask the bussers as they passed by. We understood at first since he was taking care of a large party but after they left, he only had us and still was absent!  Having been a restaurant corporate trainer for servers and managed restaurants I tend to be a little more patient than most but this went beyond my patience. I will definitely give them another try since the food was good but hopefully they redeem themselves with their service.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	-VLiN9fEAL73bkV87ixRDw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Margaritas we're delicious! Salsa that comes out with the chips is pretty spicy. My husband was impressed by the selection of craft beers available since he was expecting domestic drafts & corona. My only minor issue was sitting out on the patio and not being able to read the menu because the lighting isn't that great.

The cocktails and Aqua Frescas were    unique and so delicious. I was told that they come in early to prepare the drink mixes from scratch. I tried three tacos; the fish was my favorite. The chicken was a bit spicy, the pork was ok. I will definitely return and will be bringing my friends!	0	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	fcIgkvXTmwq3IlKGX3pcAw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
OvPYAmyVIiogOsJihsInMA	4	2014-04-30 00:00:00	where to begin with this place?  located in the heart of downtown Gilbert, this place has retro written all over it.  everything from the sign to the decor has a mid century modern meets a surf side grub joint style to it.  walking in i was really amused with the place so i knew i would be in for a good time.  \n\non this visit i only came for some beers and sadly did not get to try any of the food other than the chips and salsa which were quite tasty.  The beer selection was pretty decent with a large collection of Mexican beers.  i was happy they had my favorite which is Victoria.  Although I did not taste, the fish tacos looked pretty scrumptious as well.  \n\ndowntown Gilbert is really booming and if you're looking for a fun festive atmosphere this place is it.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	_qDBBoXEGB5AdRb33uJrNA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The staff can be a bit less than friendly and that's really the only thing that keeps me from going there more often.

pdhQ_GRRBHKv532f_36AeQ	4	2013-09-09 00:00:00	I love everything Upwards Projects (Postino, Churn, Windsor, Federal Pizza) does, and Joyride is no different.\n\nOver 3,000 square feet of space, patios in the front and back, garage doors on each side, colorful leather seats, eclectic art, and a hint of Baja created an overall relaxed destination for enjoying a modern twist on Mexican.  The music ranged from "Eleanor Rigby" by The Beatles to "Little Red Corvette" by Prince, which I loved.\n\nWe started with Aqua Frescas at the bar.  Almond Horchata spiked with Amaretto liqueur (nutty, sweet, hints of cinnamon, perfect) and a Cucumber Mint with vodka.  It was pulpy, sweet, and divine.  All of their juices are squeezed fresh daily and include pineapple, citrus, and strawberry.  A spike legend on the menu gives you recommendations on best spirits to combine with each. Non alcoholic is $3.5, with spirit $8 ($5 during HH).\n\nAs with any traditional Mexican restaurant, we received salsa and chips.  The fire roasted salsa and chips are complimentary, but other salsas are available for $2 or 3 for $5.  These are the tomatillo, guajillo pepita, pico gringo, chile de Arbol, and charred habanero.  The salsas were described as either "kinda hot" or "melt your face".\n\nThe tacos came on "made to order" corn tortillas served family style.  The presentation of the tacos was fantastic!  We tried the carne asada, the crispy as well as grilled fish, chicken tinga, and carnitas ranging from $3.50-4.50.\n\nThere were also four types of burritos such as "The Beast" with carne asada, Anasazi beans, avocado, fire roasted salads and pico gringo.\n\nI enjoyed the Chicken Burrito with rotisserie chicken, avocado, pico gringo, and a white and creamy Aji Amarillo.  This also came with a garden variety mix of Cremini mushrooms, peppers, corn, and squash, which I skipped.\n\nOverall, menu is fairly simple and straightforward, with some modern twists here and there.	2	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	P2sQVHyHmy4WA0I7NI5hWg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The food is full of flavor. If you like spice, they have it. If you like sweet, they have that too. My FAV drunk is the mint cucumber with vodka. The almond horchatta(sp?) Is awesome as well! I think they have about five or so Salas to try, I tried all the spicey ones; amazing! So far in my two visits I've had the fish taco, scallop taco, and carne asada taco.....yummy! All of them. If you've read any of my other reviews, you'll see how picky I am. If it's not healthy, I won't eat it. I have diet restrictions; celiac, and dairy. They were super cool with accommodating my diet. The bartenders and servers are top notch. I have to ask what's in everything....they all seem to know the ingredients like the back of their hand. Cool place, esp for Gilbert!

We left cash on the table and left completely unnoticed... this has also happened to me once before on a busy weeknight. \n\nI come here at least once a month since DT Gilbert is in my neighborhood and I appreciate a place where it's easy to find foods that I can eat on this menu!	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	gSIYBauoe0bUuB_eOYWRtw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

With items like squash and goat cheese enchiladas and a dozen different tacos to choose from, each was extremely satisfied with their food. I also thought it was a nice, strong but not-too-sweet marg. loved the decor and kid-friendliness outdoors. The only small complaint was they didn't have a dedicated waitress per table, we kept being helped by different people, so you could say requests were a little slow, but the food came out fast. Maybe it was a Sunday night thing. Can't wait to go back.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	DqO2fkXeCGIMSwwhDLzFpQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

PouqG1pBFyY627WnGppQ9w	5	2015-01-14 00:00:00	First off, HOORAY for taco Tuesdays! I've been going to Joyride for months and months. For margaritas/drinks, for tacos, for burritos, and obviously for the music.. Whether it's a date night or with a bunch of friends, I always enjoy my drinks and food here. I've also always received excellent customer service both at tables and at the bar --on top of the delicious food. Especially tonight. \n\nWeird story.. another customer ended up pulling the garage door (which I love the concept of) down on my shoulder tonight because his wife was a bit chilly. The guy wasn't paying attention and the door ended up landing super hard my shoulder. For starters I am accident prone and it's something that would happen to me. IT WAS NOT ON THE STAFF AT ALL, buuuut they were SO kind and overly concerned. Our server and the manager went above and beyond to make sure all was good. I shrugged it off, but they did not. As if I could love the place any more... they outdid themselves tonight. Which doesn't surprise me.\n\nLove it. Highly recommended. 110%!	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	7ce0lbq-bLiqPPCm9KDQoA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

psJoKGOrnZ4fCd1YqxmyCw	2	2014-07-22 00:00:00	Food was excellent, service was terrible. I have got to Postinos next door and had the most outstanding service but this place was laughable. First, we had reservations for 6:30 on a Monday and we had to wait with our kids until after 7 to be seated. It is my understanding that it you have  a reservation at a restaurant they will plan for your table to be ready at the time you reserved it.\n\nThen there was our server, Michael. Well, Michael seemed to me not to have a care in the world. We had two tables and I guess two servers. My daughter sat at the other table but we informed Michael that we would like her dinner on our check he said, that's not my table. Um, okay but we still would like her "kids" meal on our tab. Okay, I'll take care of that he said. We ordered our meal and he/we forgot our son's "kid" meal. I had to wave him down to order it. I said he'll have the quesadilla, Michael asked no other questions. Like what would he like to drink? What side would you like him to have? Nope, just said okay and took off. I had no time to ask for the additional parts of my son's meal. He is 2 and was climbing all over the booth like any other terrible 2 year old. Finally, when I got a second to ask for his chocolate milk I said doesn't he get a side too. Michael said, oh I ordered him the fruit. Um, okay, I hope he likes the "fruit" thanks for giving us a choice. I hope he isn't allergic or have some sort of other problem with "fruit". Why would he take the chance and just lazily order what "he" thought was right for my child. I had to ask twice for the chocolate milk to because Michael forgot.\n\nOh, and guess what? My friends at the other table got the bill for my daughter's meal. Really? After we specifically said, "please put her meal on our tab". Instead of trying to get Michael's attention again, we just told our friend we would pay him later and we left because it was getting super late and our kids were melting down.\n\nMichael, you need to learn how to serve people food. It isn't super hard. I did it for 7 years, you just have to care. Maybe go over to Postinos and ask any one of their servers for some training.	1	1	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Nu6vOZNrPRqSE-ZzNIlnQA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
PTSMXMqbuSEmCZj96q751g	5	2014-03-25 00:00:00	Pleasantly surprised by...everything. \n\nShort wait for a table of 6, drinks while we waited. I was impressed by the salsa, I think it had jicama(?) as did the guacamole. \n\nTried 2 different agua frescas (cucumber mint with gin & horchata with amaretto) both delicious & $5 on happy hour. The taco combo (3 tacos + 1 side) is a lot of food. Tried the shrimp, carne asada, and some chicken one...the shrimp was my favorite. \n\nI was very pleased by how clean and decorative the inside is, the staff is friendly, and of course delicious food. \n\nWill definitely come back.

Pv9YH6a47Rwg09SlEkPrkg	3	2013-08-15 00:00:00	Went there on a Tuesday night with some friends for my husbands birthday dinner. Got there at 6:30 and was told it would be a 15-20 minute wait. We got ourselves seated at the bar and were promptly greeted by the bartender. He walked us through the fresh Agua Frescas drinks and their signature cocktails. I ordered the cucumber lime Agua Fresca with gin and my friend ordered the blood orange marg. Both were knock your socks off good! Little hefty on price, but delicious! Also ordered the Citrus Agua Frescas and a Pineapple mojito....same caliper...delish! Chips and salsa were amazing. Nice hefty chips with just the right amount of salt. Smoky, spicy salsa that wasn't too chunky. We waited for our table for about 30 minutes before the waitress came and grabbed us. She was very apologetic but we told her were fine waiting with drinks and chips! \nNext came the food. Our group ordered the machaca burrito, short ribs tacos, carne asada burrito and a grilled and fried fish taco. Also ordered the mexican street corn. \nStarting with tacos: \nWe were told the best seller was the short rib tacos. I found them to lack any flavor at all and had to add salt and salsa to give them any taste. Same goes for the grilled fish. Very bland. \nBurritos: Carne Asada burrito was ok. Not great.  It was a huge burrito that my husband only ate half of. \nMachaca burrito was good. I didn't try this but was told by my friend that it was really good at the beginning, but then lost it's luster half way through. \nGrilled Street Corn: I consider myself an aficionado on Mexican street corn. When driving through Mesa, I drive slow so that I can look for the carts and will stop and order it. I love, Love LOVE street corn. While they made a great attempt, it wasn't on point. The corn was way over cooked...almost mushy.  Didn't have a great deal of spice, even though there was chili powder on it. The cotija cheese was yummy. \n\nAll in all, this place is great for pre-dinner drinks and appetizers. I will definitely try it again, but will order something else.\nI give the drinks a 5 out of 5\nI give the food a 2 out of 5. \nI give the chips and salsa a 4.5 out of 5.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	h28HDPiw-5yz6PWJQxQ_-A	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
pwCxjYg9uDOeZQcbfUvvjw	5	2013-10-29 00:00:00	After reading all of the mixed reviews, my wife and I were a bit nervous to try what appeared to be an overly hipster Mexican joint.  It's an understatement to say we were blown away!  Our server Justin was super friendly and provided stellar service. We started with the Shrimp Ceviche which had just the right amount of acidity and copious amounts of fresh plump shrimp.\n\nFor our entrees, we shared three tacos: a fried fish, a grilled shrimp, and a cochinata pibil. All were absolutely delicious, but the standouts in my opinion were the shrimp and fish, especially the fresh guacamole which added just the right amount of freshness to the fried fish.  We also split the Enselada Fila which was fresh, crispy, light, and vibrant!  Although slightly overpriced, Joyride Taco House is well worth it with its fresh ingredients and friendly service.  Lesson well learned: never judge a hipster book by its cover.	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	gwh9BAVQWhvOcB51AlrXHw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
PwNsp_SIupEWGLeghpwa3g	3	2015-10-24 00:00:00	Went to Joy Ride today and was disappointed. The service was wonderful and attentive but the ceviche did not really have much shrimp and the tacos were light in filling. The ceviche had maybe 2 shrimp for 12.5 not a great value. However, the shrimp that we did try was seasoned well and tasted great. The carne asada taco again, great flavor little meat. I began to wonder today with the lunch specials that they offer are they skimping other places? Bummer... Joy ride is one of my favorites places to go. I love the funky atmosphere and food but it not really living up to my experiences there. I hope that in the future they get back to where they used to be fusing all aspects of dining: great atmosphere, great tasting food and providing a great to good value.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	fO7vgf1CSP1mWpGxRXCzWQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Our waitress showed her face to take our order then everyone else had to pick up the slack.  I had to flag down bus staff for drink refills.  The good taco was the braised beef and the rest was okay.  Really the service is what blew it.  Walked up to the manager to have him tab me out after waiting 10 min with a cleared table.  Then he forgot to return my card.  Not going back.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	RzZAbT_cQ-f2ToKhlenX1g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Q-PC2eA1RVuD9l9v2QONTQ	2	2014-01-29 00:00:00	Having been favorably impressed by other of the Upward restaurants, I looked forward to my first visit to this new addition in north central Phoenix. I was not much impresssed.  The service was more aggressive than attentive without really being service-oriented.  Servers and bussers were quick to remove drink glasses, for instance, but not to inquire if we wanted another drink.  When the food arrived, our order was incorrect.  The salad we had ordered was replaced by a side of rice, and it took an inordinate amount of time to correct this. Companion and I were halfway through our entrees when the correct salad finally arrived.  I really like Mexican food,  but I was not impressed with the selections we ordered. The oranges in the orange and cucumber salad tasted canned.  The tacos were small and bland.  The chicken burrito was barely warm, tasted like boiled chicken in mayonnaise sauce.  I got the impression of Mexican food for people who do not like Mexican food.  We will give it another chance, maybe just for drinks after work, but not for the food.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	WkWphxZ3WI6RfTmw2HwMJg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I joined friends and family on opening night 7 in all, Justin our waiter handled us like a pro. Not only was he a good waiter but everytime I blinked there was someone at our table with water, drink refills or clearing our table asking us if we needed anything else, they rock the team work attitude!  From the homemade chips & fireroasted salsa of which we devoured 3-4 helpings to the tasty chicken tinga, shrimp & scallop tacos,chicken nachos,machaca burritos, empanadas and El Domingo dessert with carmelized pineapple, caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream we finished every tasty bite! \nAn extra thank you for replacing my picky princesses taco, which came with beans she wasn't willing to eat, once the beans were gone so was her taco! Happy kid, happpy Mom!\nThis is the place to go to add a little spice in your foodie life!

David and the other bartenders are awesome people and great at their jobs, even on such a busy night. The carne asada tacos are #1 for sure. I like the crispy fish as well. If you're looking for a burrito ask the bartenders for a recommendation. They know all the secrets!  As far as legit Mexican tacos, that's not what you go here for.

Got the 2 battered fish tacos and 2 carne asada tacos. Took about 20 minutes for a to go order and they weren't busy. \n\nI went straight home but found that the food wasn't warm. After biting in, I realized I probably should have heated it up. Not bad but not very flavorful. Overall ok and I'm not going to turn down tacos. They also forgot my side that was supposed to come with the meal. There is another taco chop nearby that I'm sticking with.  I will give them 5 stars for their churros though.

Both times we had great service. 5-stars in that section, very nice and attentive. The -2 stars are for the pricing vs. the quantity for food. You can easily rack your bill up here for some of the most standard dishes. Food itself is good. Drinks are good. But I cannot believe how much the menu items are. The wow-factor was not there for me unfortunately.

BUT it is CROWDED on that night of course so be advised.  Good to great service both times I visited, fair prices even on non promo days.  My only critiques are, the prickly pear marg is GROSS I'm sorry it is just nasty, and I have no idea why refried black beans are a thing here.  When I ordered the black beans, I was not told they were refried and mushed to death.  They were too salty or....SOMETHING I'm not sure what I tasted but NO don't do it.  Black beans are best with salt, citrus, and left whole.  No need to be overly fancy.  GREAT tacos though, good salsa, pretty decent guac although its the one thing on the menu that is overpriced for the portion you get.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	cgL4BoPCkxu7Z12ctTT0UQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

qLapMSzd5Yr96v7YrPFnMQ	4	2015-01-24 00:00:00	Went over to enjoy HH with my friend. They had a decently sized HH menu so we were excited to try it out. On weekdays, HH lasts from 2pm-6pm, and the menu features $5 margaritas, $5 pitchers of Dos Equis or Negro Modelo, $2 tacos, and a few other items.\n\nJoyride Tacos is a cute little spot that seems reminiscent of a beach bar. We went at an odd hour, and they were still pretty busy which seemed promising. There was room at the bar so we sat right away, and we were promptly served with waters and some chips with salsa. The salsa was light and very acidic with a very slight kick. \n\nThe server brought over small plates, but the bottom one had crusted food (maybe guacamole based on the color) on it, but he promptly took it back as soon as he noticed. We got the prickly pear margarita and the bloody orange margarita, crispy fish tacos, pork adobada tacos, carne asada tacos, ceviche, and some beer. The pitchers of beer for $5 were smaller pitchers (the same size as they serve at Postino's HH). I don't like sweet drinks much, so the margarita was a bit sweet for me. Also, being from New Mexico, I was not very impressed with the prickly pear margarita nor the pork adovada; the margarita was nothing that memorable but not bad. It was strong at least, which is always good. My friend only said her bloody orange margarita was a lot sweeter than my margarita.\n\nThe food overall was a little bit bland. I personally like my food less salty, so if you are like me, it may be a nice change of pace from other restaurants in that sense. However, I know that under seasoned food is not looked upon kindly in restaurants. My friend liked the carne asada taco best as it did have some nice smokey notes, but again, it was under seasoned. The tacos were also a decent size (bigger than I thought they would be. I had expected more traditional sized tacos). The crispy fish tacos were probably my favorite, only because of how crisp they were, but they were also the least flavorful. The pork adovada and the carne asada were both dry.\n\nThey were pretty busy, but it did kind of suck that they forgot our order for more beer twice (two different servers too). Another server usually found us, fortunately, but it was a tad bit annoying to keep being told to hold on, while we waited. \n\nOverall, I think it is a decent HH spot, but definitely not my favorite. I would rank this maybe a 3.5 or 4 star experience. Not sure if I will really return as there are so many good restaurants in the area. Maybe if I am in the area and want some beer and California-style tacos (though I prefer authentic tacos)? Not the worst, but not anywhere near the best.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	a1lOxWZf2dJw8DuzJnRycQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I also had the Bandit, which was kind of like a tamale plate.  Didn't think this was particularly unusual, but I loved their marinated pork - so good. \n\nThis Mexican/Latin based food restaurant even has delicious agua frescas (with or without alcohol) and its own version of a Moscow Mule called the Mazatlan Mule, made with tequila and passion fruit puree.

There were four of us that ended up going on a Sunday afternoon. The place was packed but we got a table right away. As soon as we sat down we received water and chips and salsa. I have never received such prompt service. We had not even been there thirty seconds! So far, I LOVED this place. Nothing worse then waiting for water in the summertime (ok it was Sept but still felt like summer) in AZ. The waitstaff was fantastic. They were friendly and prompt which is a great combo! Our group ordered two "Garden Variety Burritos" (one with no mushrooms ewwww) and two of "the Beasts.'" It was fantastic. I was worried there would be too much salt in the food since I have experienced that in the past at other establishments that serve Mexican food. I was pleasantly surprised. It was seasoned to perfection and no one had any complaints. I will defiantly be back.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	uMlSemV8KE0VE8Mbz-seAA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Bartender was rude and clearly not liking his job. I tried to give them a little slack since it was Taco Tuesday, but there are way better places out there without the long wait and much better drinks and service.	0	1	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	uo8-ekUCWdFlFTfAzAUcIA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
QYU2IWYPfv2-Ahzyzt_mag	1	2015-05-23 00:00:00	Saying that this restaurant sucks is probably the nicest thing I can even come up with! The food was boring but expensive. The soda was flat the entire night and our drinks would sit empty for 20 minutes before anyone would think to refill them.  The service was absolutely horrible and to top it off when we paid our bill the server also ran my card for someone else's meal. Instead of giving me a heads up that they made a mistake I found out the next day when balancing my check book.  When we contacted the restaurant to make sure that the transaction was canceled the manager told us he would call us back the next morning because they were very busy.  No big deal until the phone call didn't come. When we called back to follow up you could tell that the manager was annoyed that we were asking him to verify that the $70 transaction was canceled.  The least that could have been done was an apology but that never came! I will make sure that nobody in my family or group of friends ever return to this restaurant!	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	9-l2CEIsujp85OOZMamXUw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The pink grapefruit mint aguafresca was the flavor of the day. It was good and refreshing. Cucumber one, not so good.Needed simple syrup and more straining. Horchata just okay.   \n I did not care for the type of fish they used for the crispy fish taco. Didn't seem mild enough.\n The chicken tinga was okay but I make it with more balanced spice and better texture in my slow cooker at home (its super easy) We got a couple of desserts and they were yummy! \n All in all, I can appreciate the taqueria which serves  aguas , homemade tortillas , and a good complement of desserts.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Hg0TGK_XnbAHsmfHvi7rvw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Party of 6 came in at 6:20 and sat behind us. They received their food at 6:42. \nAt 6:45 we still hadn't seen our server or our food. We excused ourselves from the table and proceeded to walk out the door. \nWe had our bridal appointment at 7 and couldn't wait any longer. As we were leaving we stopped the hostess and informed her that we were leaving and I left $20 on the table for our drinks.

RJpF5Gxy5GJ7m_bSu-BIYQ	3	2015-03-16 00:00:00	Up until last night I would have easily given Joyride 4 stars, however, after last nights dinner service (or lack thereof) I had to drop them down to 3 stars. Its unfortunate, because their food is absolutely delicious. My fiance and I have eaten at Joyride 3 times within the last month and the only thing that has stayed the same is the quality and taste of their food. The service seems to be very hit and miss. Our first experience was fantastic. Our waitress was kind and attentive. Our second visit was at the bar. The service was good, nothing outstanding like our first visit, but not bad. And then there was last night..... Talk about a catastrophe. Our waitress had little to no idea what she was doing. Multiple times throughout the night we were sure that we had been forgotten about. Our waitress took our dinner and drink order after we had been sitting ready and waiting to order  for over 15 minutes, it then took another 10 minutes to get our teas, and then she completely disappeared until it was time to pay. She never came back to check on us. When she presented us with the check, it was incorrect, so she had to go back and try it again. It took her another 15 minutes to come back with the correct check. Our dirty dishes and empty chip trays were never cleared off of the table, everything just sat there stacking up. The manager passed by our table several times, looked straight at us sitting there waiting with dirty dishes all around, and just kept walking.... \nAgain, the food is wonderful. We absolutely love the shrimp, braised beef, carne asada tacos, and chicken nachos but wow the service keeps going downhill with each visit. If the service continues to follow this same pattern I am terrified to see what it would be like if we decide to go back....	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Dx2gQSFHsM4fpclrBV3d0A	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I was a little sad that my taco shells fell apart and they became pretty messy. I would request flour tortillas next time! They have really good tequila and margaritas as well!

I ordered the crispy fish tacos and the fish was dry dry dry. I think they over fried it because it was really tough. I also ordered a side of the street corn.

Nachos are SOGGY (i've had them twice...because i was hoping the first time was a mistake.)

RZSBVu7jd62nhnhmjZnmmQ	3	2016-05-10 00:00:00	This taco shop is located in downtown Gilbert. My husband and I decided to give it a try. We stopped right at lunch time and it was moderately busy. We were greeted right away, when the host asked us where we wanted to sit, we asked for a booth inside, but he took us to a table outside, under a tree that was shedding. Normally, on a warm day in AZ you welcome sitting in the shade, but not this time. \nWe asked to be moved inside, and we found a booth. Our waitress was by a short time later for our drink orders. The menu is pretty basic, salads, soups, tacos, burritos, sides....I feel the prices are high for what this place is. I feel that 4.50 for one small shrimp taco is high, but that's just my opinion. I ordered the shrimp tacos, 2 of them. Our food came out in a reasonable amount of time. \nThe tacos were average. Nothing spectacular. There were 3 big pieces of shrimp, lettuce, tomato and pico de gallo. \nThe decor is yuppie, trendy and upscale. The service was okay. Our waitress was friendly, and attentive.	5	1	3	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	8ifOe57JHVEIzmTRt-0VuQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

s3Rq3cp3C0xGU6ovJd6RFA	2	2015-01-21 00:00:00	Edit:  This place was great when it first opened.  I've ordered food twice lately that was just bad.  The first time I thought it was just a bad day for them...the second time they sent me with a cold to-go order (I was there early) with zero flavor and they didn't even add in chips and salsa.  When I am paying $10+ for a standard taco lunch I expect something pretty phenomenal.  This was not it.  I won't be going back.\n\nI'm only giving Joyride 4 stars because of the price.  It seems a bit expensive (if you don't go on a Tues) for some tacos.  With that being said, I've tried 5 or 6 different flavors and they are all delish.  I don't know that I will drive great distances to go there, but if I'm in town I'll definitely eat at Joyride (if I'm not already at one of the other amazing Gilbert restaurants).	2	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	oHewXSQBveJFVgQzN302AA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
S7mzBNVaj65Sfaw8m241FQ	5	2016-06-01 00:00:00	Cute decor and delicious food. The tacos are small street tacos so if you come really hungry, it can get a little pricey. I've tried all of the tacos, except for the ones with seafood, and all of them were very tasty. There is a good selection of beer and other alcoholic beverages. I really like all of the watermelon drink concoctions they have, but everything I've tried is delicous. I enjoy coming here for drinks and smaller meals. I like to come during week days on sort of off hours when its not as crowded.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	xvb1jT9RnTY19ghmMM2fDg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Bad fish is supposed  to be thrown away, not hidden in a taco. Waiter thought he could memorize the order,  he was mistaken, should've  written it out. \nNeedless to say, I won't  be back.	2	3	2	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	ew7Fq4rd0KRe8-uimfCX3g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The server (who I think is new) was great. My carne asada taco was the best I've ever had there. The bar is set high for our next visit, which will probably be soon.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	YqLvGb25y6Jdr7C-DvCUwQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Sit at the bar and you will not be disappointed. IF you are lucky enough to have Chris(tall and bearded) as your bartender, you will have the best service in town. The fish tacos are great and the nachos are probably the best item on the menu to share. \n\nOne again upward projects has provided an awesome restaurant and I can't say enough GREAT things about this place and it's staff.	1	1	2	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	j1VYCXm6JVNZxK8M96RIWg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Our waitresses/editors always have out drink order memorized. We love the carne tacos, chicken tinga tacos, Mexican street corn and the cheesy mas to start. Our daughter loves the Virgin prickly pear lemonade.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	sEssFiTlT3xcwqnqXkiqwg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
SfecsUZH3UdH1TKfvP8JdQ	2	2016-05-09 00:00:00	This taco house is located in downtown Gilbert. We stopped here for lunch while shopping in town. We were greeted immediately. The seating host asked us if we wanted to sit inside or outside. I said we wanted an inside booth. We were seated outside under a tree. The waitress brought chips and salsa. While getting our drinks debris kept dropping out of the tree above us. I asked if we could go inside and we did. I ordered a burrito, "The Beast". This is a burrito made with carne asada, pinto beans, avocado, Pico de Gallo. and cheese wrapped up in a flour tortilla. I wasn't impressed with this Americanized burrito. It lacked flavor and was rather dry. I can't give this place more than a 2 star when Filaberto's has a better burrito for half the price.	26	11	15	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	EXKDLuYoZUKUNNNYA7TlGQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Both my hubby and I ordered the the beast burrito. Carne asada, avocado, beans, salsa. We asked for no rice in our burritos. Diet coke, iced tea. Burritos tasted good with fresh tasting ingredients. Service was quick. Unfortunately, lots of grisely pieces of unchewable meat. I get it, sometimes a bad piece gets through but I had like 4. For 11.50$ a burrito I expect better quality meat. Good chips and salsa.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	daSPgHKWaeAh9EgecvFy-Q	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

sh6TDwVi7h9oYOAUaNSE9Q	2	2013-10-03 00:00:00	Ugh I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way. My girlfriend and I have driven passed this place a few times and since she loves Mexican food and it was our anniversary, we decided to give it a try. Initial impression of the place was good, great music, nice atmosphere, we walked in with smiles. After a 5ish minute wait we were seated and received our complementary chips and salsa. Chips were good, salsa was meh. This is where the experience went downhill. To make it short, horrible horrible service, we probably read the entire menu 5 times before anyone showed up. Anyway, on to the food, we both ordered carne asada tacos and carnitas tacos. Let me say, I enjoyed the pork tacos, good flavor, nice and juicy, very good. The carne asada on the other hand tasted like I was eating a burnt charcoal piece of meat. Once our mediocre meal was complete, we decided to take a nap since we had plenty of time before our server checked up on us. After giving us our bill twice (really?) we finally paid and left. Ugh this location is close and we had high hopes but alas another restaurant bites the dust.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	EPtsM7ROO1HKXfMv51ebNA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The drinks were decent, our whole party of 5 ordered the fresh pressed juice (agua frescas). I ordered the cucumber mint which was different, and kinda dangerous in that I couldn't even taste the vodka that i ordered it with! I would love to try another flavor next visit. The chips were good and salsa was fresh. The food was great! My friend ordered the fish tacos, i ordered the veggie burrito (which was a tad salty, but still very good) and my husband ordered the beef burrito. The portions were VERY generous. We went during happy hour, so 2 drinks and 2 burritos (for my husband and i) came out to $24! Super affordable!

The service was really good but it could be because they weren't too busy yet and they were only open for an hour and it was still early. Our server immediately brought out chips and salsa for us to snack on and the salsa was delicious! Well seasoned and really refreshing. I ordered the short rib, crispy fish, and carnitas tacos and wow were they delicious! The crispy fish and short rib tacos were really good but the carnitas wasn't all that great. There was a lot of meat in the short rib taco and the crispy fish was a nice size and had a great crunch. My boyfriend had a carne asada burrito called "the beast" and wow was that amazing too! The meat was tender and well flavored and the meat had a charred grill flavor to them which made the burrito super delicious! We had their mexican 75 cocktail and almond horchata with armaretto and those were delicious too! the drinks are on happy hour all day till 5pm and they were only $5. Overall experience was great and we'll definitely be back!	4	0	2	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	0ibm06KpYdnGL8Ga55w5RQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I'll chalk it up to the loads of trendy skinny -jean wearers trying to be as cool as we are. Now that it's filled with normal citizens, the food is much improved and they do have a nice draft beer assortment along with some wine for my wife.  It's nice to dance between postino next door and here so you can mix it up depending on what you are craving.

Very airy and open, perfect for the weather we're having at this moment.  Pineapple Mojito caught my eyes even before I decided on my food, which was a little too sweet for my taste.  Hubby ordered The Bandit (chicken, carne asada, cochinita pilbil plate).  FIL had The Beast carne asada and bean burrito.  Both paired their food with Stella.  To go with my Mojito, Vegetarian and Goat cheese enchilada with salsa verde and ancho chile sauce was a perfect fit.  My little cutie pie had his usual quesadilla and fresh lemonade.    No room for any dessert.  We do want to try their churro with chocolate dip next time around.\n\nThe service was impeccable!  Everyone seemed like they enjoy working there.  The manager came by to ask how everything was.  It was very good, thank you!	11	6	8	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	8UPTxp6SXvQe6JoEbEGcyA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

suDnGpzixiS3JLORHEWQYA	4	2015-06-29 00:00:00	Today was my first time at this restaurant. I went to the Gilbert location with some girlfriends. The atmosphere was really cool, good happy hour, and the menu looked interesting. There was chips and salsa ( which was good and surprisingly spicy) waiting for me thankfully because I was starving. The guacamole appetizer was good (kind of hard to screw up guacamole). My friend got some beans as an appetizer, they were basically "crunchy" and inedible. The server was so nice and cute about it, she took them and didn't charge us, but she handled it very gracefully and it wasn't awkward, which is usually the case in that situation. I got a Bloody Mary, which was just ok, a little overly salty. My friends loved their margaritas though. I got a salad which was delicious, the girls got tacos and were so impressed (so many options!). Dessert was also a hit, which was some banana pudding Carmel pecan thing in a jar, yum! I will definitely be going back, for $2 taco Tuesday!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Fvk1mEpE9RVQS9x3oVwh4g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

sWZRsitksVOGKe7Ipc03tQ	5	2013-09-15 00:00:00	Get beyond the super high hipster factor and treat yourself to Joyride. The food is varied and delicious, the prices are just right. Full of flavor, my carne asada and chicken street tacos were awesome- loaded with meat and veggies. The "white magic" sauce was super tasty too. There's a great kids menu to order from if you bring the family. There's plenty of seating, even for larger groups- and the decor is as you'd expect from Upward Projects (Postino, Windsor, Federal Pizza). The staff is great, they seem to play more of a "zoned" game wherein many servers will cover each other's tables to ensure the customer is being treated right. Don't worry about empty drink glasses or missing food, that didn't happen for us at Joyride. The place was busy, don't let a small wait time scare you away. There's competition at the other end of Gilbert road (So Cal Fish Taco Company) but I'd have to give Joyride the 5th star when comparing. If you're craving good mexican food (tacos, burritos, ensaladas, etc.) do yourself a favor and head over to Joyride. Sign up for their email list and you'll get offers for free food, etc. We didn't order drinks but they offer a full bar and plety of room to huddle around it and enjoy your cervezas or margaritas.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Bv13-l4HTz-pt5kS22y9LQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Went on a Tuesday for taco Tuesday. 1.5 hr wait time. Walked around downtown Gilbert and they texted me when the table was ready, which was nice. (So we didn't have to wait at the door and lose our spot in line) Not all of the tacos on the list are $2. Well, the best ones on the list aren't $2. Lol. But if you get the $2 tacos they're pretty filling and it's a pretty good price, but not the best tacos in AZ for us taco enthusiasts.

We were celebrating a birthday and we were seated by the front door so the ambiance was looking at Gilbert Rd.  The menu was simple and the food overpriced and underwhelming for tacos...I had a burrito which came out burned....it was extremely tiny for $8.  It was black, plunked on a plate, with no other friends, embellishments or garnish,  except an itty-bitty cup for a tablespoon of sauce.  Honestly how much does a thimble of beans, rice or salad cost!???\n\n I sent it back and they graciously and profusely apoligized,the manager even came by and apoligized and brought me an unburned version of the same, tiny, burrito.   My friends had three tacos that looked ok.  Since I'm from California,  the Mexican, or trendy Mexican food in Arizona , is substandard to say the least and not even close to what I'm used to.  Mexican food is not expensive...\n\nThe manager took the burrito off the bill but with tacos, burrito and non-alcoholic drinks $48 with tip.  Plus, no  treat for the birthday girl and the desserts did not sound appetizing..\n\nI will never return,  It didn't WOW me...there are bigger and better out there , without the hype, the trend, the crowded location and full parking lots on a Wednedsay night !  It's no big deal!\n\nI realize this is a bar atmosphere but I'm beginning to be extra picky about a little bit food for high prices....and the quality better rock, to justify those prices...	2	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	my7xZKg5HKSattJvrW2DhQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

My favorite food is tacos so im very picky when it comes to trying out new taco places. First of all it was great service, our waitress was very nice and welcoming. She was also very consistent and she recommended that I try the chicken tinga tacos so I ordered two of those and i also ordered 2 braised beef tacos and they were soo good! The food came out very fresh and the meat was nice and tender. Honestly, better than I expected! I will definitely be going back and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone craving delicious tacos!

The burrito I ordered was surprisingly larger than I expected although it was pretty difficult to eat but a fork helped with that.

The hubs didn't care for it too much, but he would prefer a big-ass burrito wrapped in foil to something with complex flavors and interesting ingredients. :) I love him, but he's not a foodie. I really enjoyed it--the tacos were fresh, brightly flavorful, and the meat was perfectly cooked. The house wine was great, too. Didn't taste cheap, and at $9 a glass, it better not be! The kids' menu was totally do-able for my picky 6 year old. She had a quesadilla with fruit salad and gobbled it up. We told her no churro for dessert if she didn't...that did it! \n\nDessert took 20-30 minutes to come out. Not sure what happened, but they noticed, and they comped the dessert, plus gave us a $10 voucher for next time--very classy move, and saved the experience. \n\nI'll be back, probably not with the husband, but with my friends who are more adventurous!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	-SYtJl95W_FMMXEQoIIpGw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The wait was a bit long but we found out it was worth the wait. The staff was very friendly as well. They have delicious chips and salsa, we couldn't stop eating them! My boyfriend ordered three of the beer battered fish tacos and I ordered three tacos as well, beer battered fish, Carnitas, and chicken. For our side dishes my boyfriend had black beans and I had the orange and cucumber salad. I thought the Carnitas and fish tacos were fantastic although I didn't care for the chicken. My boyfriend said the black beans were fine and my salad was okay. I put a little salt and pepper on it to make it less bland, maybe more than two mini oranges? We did feel the prices were a little high for tacos. However, because the tacos and chips and salsa were so tasty we would absolutely recommend this place, we'll definitely be back!	3	2	2	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	v8QnvfWXCf4651Bxg2vvIw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
T60s6-zOEiP8NsVcPdU1cw	1	2014-06-27 00:00:00	After reading all of the great reviews on Yelp, we decided to give Joyride Taco House a try. My parents, kids, sister, nephew and myself arrived right at opening so we could avoid the busy lunchtime rush. We were quickly seated and the first thing I noticed was the abundance of flies. I'd read about the fly issue, but was surprised by how many there were. I spent the entire meal swatting them away from my face, food and drink. I love restaurants with indoor/outdoor seating and understand that sometimes flies get in, but I've never seen a restaurant have as much of a fly problem as Joyride. Unfortunately, the flies weren't the only problem.\n\nPros:\n\nGreat décor and I loved the vibe of the place.\nThe outdoor seating area is amazing - I could see myself returning for a girl's night out\n\nCons:\n\nFlies - See first paragraph for details.\n\nDirty dishes - two out of seven plates were dirty and one of our cups was dirty, I understand that sometimes dishes don't get clean, but a little due diligence would prevent a plate with a dime-sized piece of food finding its way to customers.\n\nFood was subpar - Although I prefer more traditional Mexican food, I knew that \nJoyride has its own eclectic take on the cuisine and so I was prepared for the food to be different. Unfortunately, it wasn't just different but most of it lacked depth of flavor. The pinto beans and chili rellenos were bland and the kid's nachos were topped with the odd-tasting cheese. On the other side of the spectrum was the overly sweet carne asada. As an Arizona native I've tried a bevy of different carne asada marinades over my lifetime, but never have I tried one as sweet as Joyride's. Even though I have a sweet tooth, it was off putting. My nephew and my sister agreed.\n\nHit & Miss:\n\nService - The service started off great - we were seated quickly and our waitress was attentive - explaining various menu items and checking on us several times. Then she disappeared for about 10 minutes. Once we ordered, most of the food was delivered but they forgot one side and my nephew's entire meal. Thankfully the tacos cook quickly and so he didn't have to wait for long.\n\nOverall: Not one of the seven of us said we would return for lunch or dinner. My sister and I said we'd give Joyride another try and meet with friends for drinks.	3	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	uveWtvQFqVOLRQ2bJkjDdg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

T8d0EtUBFP_3B8XlUfoA1g	4	2014-04-03 00:00:00	I have been wanting to try this place since they opened up a while ago. Several of my friends have been now several times and I finally got to go check it out. I am a fan. It is a great place to go with friends and have a nice conversation and meal. The tacos are quite pricey (hence the four stars) but they are tasty as well. There is also the street corn that my buddy got when we went there. He likes corn and he said it was pretty good. Overall, I would go back again, but only with friends. At least for me this locale is not somewhere I would go by myself due to the pricy-ness for Mexican food. Honestly, it's more of an American-Mexican fusion type of food place. Authentic Mexican foodies beware! Americanized ethnic foodies go here!	2	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	EoVKoQcCVxz-wWVqCAymHA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The beast burrito was excellent and their carne asada had a ton of flavor. $5 pitchers never hurt anybody's feelings and the mos def dessert (vanilla pudding graham cracker, carmel, walnut miracle) was a solid finish. Friendly staff, enjoyable atmosphere, nice patio and really good music.

The weather was nice so we ate outside! I had Carne asada, shrimp, and crispy fish with Spanish rice on the side. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh! So much flavor and I was satisfied with every bite. Their house salsa and chips were good for starters.. My bf had braised beef, shrimp, and crispy fish tacos as well with grilled veggies which he enjoyed very much. All we could say is MMMM! Service was great and they were all friendly. Thanks for the great experience on our first time being here. Definitely will be back.	2	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Qa1YaAtpT0nuqwL9-A6m9w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

TemcVi3FWZZzoo0mjINokw	1	2013-07-08 00:00:00	I was waiting to try this new spot so I finally did.\n\nAs you can tell, I'm not a fan.\n\nI'm not a hater nor a guy who has a bad experience and opens an account just to trash a place. So this is my opinion based on my visit:\n\nService: Pretty bad. It was like a bizarre play with two waiters who didn't know what the other was doing. Things like one bringing more salsa and the other asking if we wanted more salsa. Or one took off to the kitchen after taking the order and the other showing up asking if we were ready to order. Awkward. \n\nDecor: This is probable the only highlight of the place. Nice decor, different flare, pretty interesting artwork on the walls.\n\nAmbiance: The music was super loud, the light was extremely soft (flashlight recommended) and the music playing was hideous. But come on, everything starts with the name. Joyride? Really? AYFKM? What has that to do with a mexican restaurant? The wheels on the wall might give the feeling of a joyride to nowhere.\n\nFood: The only dish that barely approved was the beet salad (not that mexican, though). The cochinita taco uneventful (plus it's a huge pet peeve for me that restaurants use names to call dishes that have nothing to do with the real thing). Carne asada taco, meh, plus the tortilla was breaking and everything was falling apart. The street corn was a tragedy packed with butter. I tried the strawberry fresh water wich was actually pretty good although super sweet (maybe ordering one and water it down would be the right way to go). The almond horchata, same thing with the cochinita. They label something with a name that is so far away from the real thing that it doesn't make sense at all. The rice was also gooey and hard (not well done and it seems that they were stirring it while cooking)\n\nPrice: OMFG, are you kidding me now? 3.50 for a taco? And that's the less expensive one. Everything is super expensive specially for what you get.\n\nSorry to the team who brought this concept but there's a lot of work to do if they want to be there for the long run.	8	3	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	LnnYSUlw_MVdtoYUt4oZ5g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
tgUBWhPEPqPCDd0hfXkHNA	4	2017-01-07 00:00:00	We came in for dinner in a Friday night and had a good experience. It was busy and they told us it would be about 45 minutes for a family of 4. We ended up waiting only 30 minutes, and they had a server outside making sure people could get drinks while they waited. They use the Nowait app for their wait list, so if you have it check before you go to get added to the list. \n\nOnce inside, our waitress came up to ask about drinks and starters. They also brought out water and chips and salsa immediately. Our food was good. They serve street tacos and some burritos. I ordered the bandit taco platter which had carne asada, carnitas, and chicken tinga. They came fajita style so I could assemble them myself. My husband ordered three tacos:shrimp, Baja fish, and carne asada. The Baja fish was really good! All the others were good too, but most were a little too salty. \n\nI also ordered a couple drinks. I had the blood orange margarita and the pineapple mojito. The margarita was strong, but good. I liked the pineapple mojito better, it was really tasty!\n\nI'd say that the main thing for me was the service. Our waitress and the server outside were very attentive and friendly. We went with our young kids and while they were prepared for families I think it's a better place for adults looking for a night out. I would definitely go back again but next time maybe with friends for a fun night out.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	uKo5VVVVTqv5MZkULzzGkA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

TkChtHiidjuaYnAnNsJKTA	5	2016-04-16 00:00:00	Rock-star treatment for a blue-collar, not-as-nicely-dressed-as-I-should-have-been guy on a fine Wednesday afternoon.  I had been hauling and delivering and installing and making a royal mess of myself before realizing I was hungry, later than lunch is served in many places. I stopped in about 3 looking for lunch, which they said they'd happily serve me, but the happy hour is insanely tempting....and so I bit!\n\nThree tacos (veg/pork/I forget the 3rd) and a, um, sorry boss, pitcher of yummy craft beer. Very delicious food, tasty premium waves (the pitcher is $5 all day until 5pm, while a pint is $6; what are YOU going to do? ;), and the drinking water (and ice-perfect size/texture...I know, that sounds weird, but you sit there and drink water and chew the ice w/o realizing you have been doing this for 5 minutes!).  Really god job by Mr DeMarco & Company.\n\nCan't wait to go back. Like tomorrow.	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	yJH888Py0bBYY1K9Kuq5Eg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
TMutAOB0TLNiknMrmOzkKA	3	2013-07-14 00:00:00	So I had high expectations because I'm such a fan of Postinos, and I probably hyped it up too much in my mind...\n\nCute, stylish decor, as expected. We opted to sit on the patio (unfortunately) because it was an hour wait for an inside table. It wasn't too bad because they have misters.\n\nWe were served water and chips and salsa right away. Thank god because I was starving! I really liked the salsa. Not a big fan of the chips though. Too thick for my taste.\n\nI got the cucumber mint aqua fresca and OMG...it was SO good! It sucked it down so fast! Our dining companions got the pineapple and said it was too sweet.\n\nAnd since it was our first time at the taco house, we got tacos. The carne asada, baja fish, shrimp, and fried fish. They were all so so good! Carne asada was so flavorful and the meat was really tender. The shrimp was cooked perfectly and there was a good amount of shrimp.  I was disappointed that there was such a small amount of fish in the fish tacos, but they were delicious. I was really pleased with the food. In fact, I usually take pics but we dove right in and they were gone before I got a chance!\n\nWhere they lose 2 stars for me is that I feel it is overpriced and I received lackluster service. Which is weird because I don't think Postinos is overpriced. But really, $4 for ONE small taco? Come on! That's ridiculous.  Also, the service was, meh. Not friendly, indifferent really. It wasn't rude but it wasn't the great service I usually experience at Postinos, so I thought that was bizarre.	2	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	iTxPwAK3uqAIg1YtB2nFKw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

We had the chicken and carnita nachos, carne asada tacos, roasted veggies, and finished off the meal with a Mo's Definitely dessert. Everything was delicious and so unique from the other Mexican taco shops in town. Very relaxed place to dine and the service was excellent. We sat outdoors on the patio and they did not try to get us to move along but let us take as much time as we wanted to enjoy the evening. Taylor was our waitress and was so pleasant and helpful that we wanted to adopt her. Anyhow, we will be back for more tacos and are eager to try the other menu temptations. Our only regret is it took us so long to finally stop in and try the place.	1	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	rOcFCblcMeWspi_lT0vuQQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I ordered chicken burrito but placed in a bowl and asked if I could have lettuce and no rice to make more of a salad. All the salads had grains and I am trying to stay low-carb.  I even mentioned this to the waitress and there was not problem.  My meal came very little lettuce a lot of corn and very little chicken.  I ate the chicken out of the bowl and when the waitress came back and saw my bowl pushed away instead of asking it there was a problem or anything she just asked if I was done. The taste of the food was nothing to right home about chicken well just chicken.  I can say overall experience was not good.	1	2	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	84RRRR2I0hupFuEf8o-hlA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

When we first got there you had to literally flag down the waitress . She wouldn't come check on us and we had to keep flagging her down. Luckily her shift ended and we got an awesome waitress and great cute waiters. I hope to go back again and have better service. Btw the nachos are amazing! Love the carne asada taco. The original margarita (with better liquor)on the rocks is good too but way overpriced $11!  I think way too much for how little you get but its pretty strong so that's a plus I guess lol chips n salsa is pretty good too  sign up for their email thingy you'll receive a free appetizer and luckily for me the nachos are considered a appetizer.

The food was okay, but I don't see myself wanting to go back there again. It was super hot in there because of all of the glass, and our server only gave me refills when I asked. I also don't like how you have pay for any salsa refills when every other Mexican restaurant provides free unlimited chips and salsa. The salsa ran out really quickly especially if you have 4 people with you.

Their Margaritas were killer. One in particular stood way out. It is the Cucumber. Fresh, smokey, and balanced. Just great. Will be back to try more of menu. Churros were delish too. Nice vibe. Demographics were across the board which makes for excellent people perch spot too. Will be back. \nUPDATE:  The food is inconsistent.  Went back on Friday and the steak burrito was grisly and bland.

Your best one yet, that I have seen. \n\nOnward to the decor. What stands out is the wall art. The old car steering wheels are pretty cool tho I don't believe I saw a wielded chrome chain one, a must, but the 12 volt headlamps were awesome. I haven't seen old car lamps used since The Limelight, a nightclub in LA. I have always thought about car lamps as an accent lightning. Well done.\n\nJoyride is part of the Federal Pizza, Postino, Windsor, Churn owners that are branching into Mexican food. Tonight I started with a Victoria Beer $2.5 for a shorty. A Vienna Lager style beer brewed in Mexico City. A very drinkable, kinda lite beer. Next came chips and a green salsa. \n\nMy entree was veggie enchiladas with goat cheese, corn and green chili, salsa verde and guajillo sauce $9. Absolutely superb. I finished off with a lime, salt and a shot of Tequila Ocho Resposado $11.5. An excellent after dinner drink.\n\nLooking forward to Joyride2 in my hood. Thank you James for the outstanding service and looking forward to the "Chefs Suprise" at the 2. Great job everybody!\n\nBTW, love the Pandora Radio.	7	4	4	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	iXGoQVfBXU0CrwrRBWXozA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

(There was no sidewalk or other way to walk to this joint)  I was seated in a booth with no lighting. A dark place with nice sunlight coming in the open double doors a few feet away. Perhaps one little light for mood, if not to allow a businessman the ability to read some documents over lunch.  The lunch special was hidden and off the menu. I knew it was 10 bucks and was the reason why I gave this place a chance.  Ordered two tacos and some kind of salad that looked like something served   at a Star Wars restaurant/bar in the movie.  The fish taco was ice cold. The shredded beef in the other taco was lukewarm at best, but tasty. \n\nForget the sauce for the chips. It is too hot!!! And nothing else to replace it. So I munched on the chips, which was the only item I loved, being a corn husker from Iowa. The soda came and walla, a broken chipped and sharp edge glass contained it. Was watered down D. Pepper. Sent that back and no replacement came until I was almost done eating the chilled tacos.  Got one free due to the screw up.\n\nFinally, watch that strange salad on the special. The peas are petrified and "rocks". I am not kidding, I almost chipped a tooth until I wised up to sort them out of the salad. Insane to put those in any food that you charge money for.  The servers, were overdoing the nicey thing. Except one who walked by and said "You could have downed a Margarita by now"  Hey Joyride Taco, I don't drink so can you please keep your stupid flyby comments to yourself?\n\nOh, BTW, there were only millennials in there for lunch. Except one dude that was older that looked like a former hippy.  The grunge head banging music was maxed out most of the time I was there and making me wish I had went to Joe's across the street where seniors are welcomed. If  you are older than 35, don't go here!!!	2	3	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	PHNSLiiXk7ScjKaSfvMaHw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I think we met everyone.  there was a minor (very minor) issue and everyone went so far out of their way to make up, it was very generous.

ULYXp2JVksl9xK07IuuVvA	3	2015-11-14 00:00:00	The street tacos are WAY overpriced and mediocre at best. Their cucumber mint Aqua Fresca is delicious but I felt like every single item on the menu was overpriced for the flavor and portion size of what you receive. Their cocktails are very good but again, their tacos are lacking. Their crispy fish taco tasted very bland and almost like fried cardboard. We might come back for a cocktail but definitely not for food.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	y3MKHZPnOzCQNjfFClvzzg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The Joyride margarita was yummy (and strong). The prickly pear margarita was a little too sweet. We were seated in 20 minutes, and once again received a friendly greeting and fast service. The tacos are amazing. The abodada taco was our favorite. Chandler and Tim both came to our table, just to check on things. The great service & yummy tacos makes this place an A+ in our book.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	kvpK5ei22ejDlEBrHsWJUQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
UPrvZFvIb-P1mwnfvE0OEA	2	2014-09-14 00:00:00	The check-in/seating system here is ridiculous. We stood by 3 vacant four top tables while they made two old ladies in front of us stand and wait for 15+ mins, then they finally gave up and sat them at the table that had been vacant the entire time. My mom has a hurt leg and she had to stand and wait even longer because it was too hot outside. Then she all of a sudden they realized they didn't put my name in the iPad, so another two tables was sat in front of us. If it weren't for the good wait staff and food we would have left a lot earlier. They just kept pushing to send people outside and to the bar and saving the tables for special clients apparently. I should mention this was on a Saturday at 1:30pm. The food and drinks were excellent and for that I give it another star.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Oxq4ipi68t7SMnYniJdpJg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
UPVv4lvB6N9IzGZNpsWY_Q	2	2013-11-27 00:00:00	I was super excited to try this place.  My dear friend and his girlfriend love this place, but my experience wasn't that great.  First of all, this place is in old town Gilbert and the location is poppin... They don't take reservations and we had about 45 minute wait.  The hostess was super friendly and typed my number and name into her ipad for a text message reminder of when my table was ready.  After waiting for only about 20 minutes, we were seated.  \n\nWe had had 2 bowls of chips for a table of six waiting for us when we got to the table.  Our waiter came to the table and got our drink order, however forgot to write down one of the drink orders and we had to remind him of that drink twice before it came out.  Once our waiter took our drink order it took him about 15 minutes to get back to us with our drinks.  Then another 15 minutes went by before he took our dinner order.  Our dinner order took awhile to get made and when the food came out, our tacos were cold.  The tacos are served "family style", which means they are all on the same taco holder and if you're allergic to fish or shrimp, sorry your carne asada taco will be served right next to the fish taco.  \n\nAll of the meat tacos lacked flavor, I would recommend trying the fish taco.  It had the best flavor out of all the options we ordered.  The waiter forgot to write down a few things that we ordered and those things never came out with our food.  We decided not to remind him about those missing sides as he would visit our table once every 15 minutes.\n\nI don't think I will be back here again.  There are other taco restaurants that I perfer over this place.	6	2	2	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	2sNEKxKcGaTVBJiokqp9Zg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I ordered 1 chicken taco, 1 carne asada and 1 grilled fish taco. My friend ordered the shrimp tacos. We received tacos, like taco bell fast, I was impressed. All 3 of my tacos tasted good. But as previous reviews mentioned, the carne asada is a little dry not sure why. My friends shrimp tacos looked awesome. I wish I would've ordered one.

It was a passion fruit cocktail in a regular glass with tequilla. No TACO TUESDAY deals! What kind of taco place does not do taco tuesday?

Waiter asked if we wanted to see the menus, seriously? don't they teach you this on the first day of training? strike two. chips were way too salty and only one kind of salsa was chincy strike 2 1/2. i have had better tacos off of taco trucks in Yuma for 1/3 the cost. if you really feel that you can open a restaurant catering to 20-30 somethings and forget about everyone else I can envision the 'for rent' sign on your window much sooner rather than later. and finally, booths that seat 6 with 2 people sitting in them.  who ever designed this place should immediately be fired. poor layout, fair food, clueless servers. make that one star. want real food with knowledgeable service at fair prices? try si senor on alma school in chandler	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	j-nTY4ejeOM2qsVZxIgN8g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Hadnt been to downtown Gilbert in a while. \n\nThe wait was about 45 min so we sat at the bar and had a couple cocktails w/tortilla chips n salsa. Pretty good salsa! I had the mandarin Margarita first & the almond horchata w/amarreto second. The margarita was good but not memorable, I liked the horchata even better. Would get again.\n\nOnce we got seated I decided on the chilaqueles for my entrée. Was my first experience with this dish. I'm happy I tried it. Lots of different textures and flavors that went went well together. From the crunch of the tostada and salsa verde, along side shredded chicken and beans as well as the sunny side up egg on top. The dish was hearty and filling. Would definitely order again. I'm hungry for it now while I'm writing this... ;)\n\nMy wife ordered the ceviche. Unfortunately I didnt try it. She really liked it and she's had ceviche in a number of places. So must be good. \n\nI saved room for desert at Peterson's ice cream & cafe down the street so we'll have to go back to Joyride to try thier sweet stuff.\n\nWe would go back.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	momSo8cyrBTg45SSg-JSzw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The corn comes on the cob with this cheesy butter mixture that is good when you start but way too much a few bites in, can you say water please? The fish tacos were something I can get at any restaurant - good, but not great. We also got the churros con chocolate that were not cooked all the way through, blech. The salsa was VERY good and the chips tasted homemade - think thicker corn tortilla style chips with lots of salt, yum!\n\nSo there it is....I went for lunch BTW so I didn't have the amazing drinks everyone on here raves about, but I don't think I'll be back for food. Maybe some chips and salsa and a marg.	2	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	F2_B94Wb9pl3Sx6gh0CmqA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

VM1geQCnfzjX0C8PZ7aGtw	4	2015-05-10 00:00:00	First off, you need to know that Friday and Saturday nights are busy so you need to be prepared for a wait. Also, the environment on these nights is festive and loud. Personally I don't think it's a good place for group events. \n\nThe quality of the food was high. The carne asada, salsas, house made tortillas etc. were all very tasty. \n\nWe were both impressed that when an error was made and someone took a special ordered item to the wrong table, thus causing a meal to be deliver late, they were obviously very concerned. We had 3 people come to the table to apologize and the manager (I believe) came by to tell us that they'd taken that item off our Bill (without us complaining or asking for it). That obvious concern and care for patrons goes a long way. \n\nThe food alone is worth coming here for. The obvious pride of ownership and care for customers makes them even more impressive.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Isf8G6HPbNqEisKDjmUlbw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I typically go in on the weekends and sometimes we have to wait a little bit to be seated but it is worth it.\n\nThe chips and salsa are amazing, and normally I go for the tacos. Crispy Fish is my favorite. Tortillas, batter, and sauces are so yummy.\n\nMy only complaint is that sometimes with their style of service (you don't have one particular server, they all kind of split zones and help out), you end up telling multiple people "No, I don't need another refill" or whatever the case is.

I had such high hopes for this place with postinos being my wife and I's favorite restaurant but man they did not get it right here.  For those of you that are thinking about going here I want to list out some pros and cons so that you don't make the same mistake I did.  \n\nPros \nThere is a great hipster trendy atmosphere and they do the same type of happy hour as postinos so if you are there before 5 the drink prices are pretty good.  Similar to postinos they do the candle light at night which some I always think had a great ambiance.  I think this is preference though as I did see in another post that the lighting was poor.\n\nCons\nService was incredibly slow it took us two and a half hours from being seated to paying the bill.  There was several times we even had to get up and go find someone to place orders or get the bill.  The tacos were small street style tacos and decent but not big enough to be 4 dollars a taco.  The enchiladas were also not very good at all.  The mixed drinks were 9 dollars a drink which is about on par for most places but they hardly gave you anything in them.  They served them in rocks glass (small to begin with) an had them filled to the top with ice.  We actually finished our entire drink before it melted and then when the ice melted it filled the cup up with 2/3 water.  \n\nI am glad to see more stuff going into downtown Gilbert and I hope these issues get fixed so that maybe at some point I will end up liking them as much as I do there sister restaurant postinos but for now I don't intend to go back any time soon.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	L3E_ulATLSP5v5ADihrRcg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
vtoT3kKHemVdsAU-FlH4TA	5	2015-07-28 00:00:00	We came here after watching a play at the Hale theater. First we started off with margaritas and I ordered the Blood Orange....omg it was tasty. They don't short you on the tequila either. I ordered the standard taco, carne adobada and the shrimp tacos. I have to say they were all amazing but my favorite was the carne adobada! I would definitely return. Very nice outdoor seating too!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	6CP6hEn7YQeEuowKcRnoaA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
VUXr-L2KPrnkFa0456XNyQ	3	2014-04-05 00:00:00	I should start by saying that I'm a native Arizona girl born and raised on authentic mexican food. Epic joints like El Ray, Casa Reynoso, and La Casita are my favs...Globe/Miami kind of mexican food. So, in comparison to what I'm used to I had to give Joyride 3 stars. \n\nThe parking in downtown Gilbert sucks and that's where Joyride is located...parking is a real negative. The decor is bright and awesome! Very hipster type decor. I loved the Star Wars art and the really cool chairs. The seating is indoor/outdoor so there was an issue with flies at our table. This definitely took away from the experience. My son was grossed out for sure.\n\nThe customer services was great, really nice people and prompt service. Without asking the waitress brought out water for my toddler with a lid so that was nice. \n\nChips and salsa are served free as an app, it's okay I guess, kind of a smokey/Chipotle type salsa flavor...not really my style. I ordered some tacos, they were okay, more upscale American infused, fancy pants style. My husband has a more refined palate and he enjoyed his dish. He got the The Beast burrito. It had a smokey fresh grilled flavor, pretty good if you're into that. The execution of the dish was stellar, you can tell they have some pros in the kitchen. The guacamole seems to be fresh and it's good. The jalapeños on top are a perfect heat, not too hot. The plating of the dishes was very nice and professional. \n\nBottom line: if you enjoy eating more of an upscale American style Mexican food, this is a place for you. If you have a simple palate, like mine, and were raised on authentic mexican food, you may be disappointed. Service is great, environment is neat, colorful, hipster. I didn't have a drink, but the bar looks cool. It would be a nice place to kick back a few with some girlfriends on a Friday night. If you want to check it out I would go early. We went here before dinner rush with no waiting. I had a friend who tried to stop in and there was over and hour wait.	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	b2l1PEw8ndoQlxzzIgeGCg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Kinda warmish\nWife ordered a rum relaxer. ( recipe online or on any smartphone search)\n1 star.  Wasn't even close. \nAmbiance 5 stars \nIn and out fast. \n\nI particularly liked that you don't get service from only ONE server \nAnyone walking by helps you out.  It results in chips, beer , guac, showing up faster.  \nThat alone  earned them an ample tip. \n\nSlight disappointments. \n\nBeer temperature and taco juiciness.	1	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	URqdPyM-SzKGDxISCfnAgQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

We each ordered a bunch of the different tacos and also some sides of rice and beans. I had a margarita that was amazing! The service could have been better though - Our server only came by to check on us once and we had to wait for 5-10 mins when we were done eating for her to come with our bill. Not sure if that was because it was a busy Friday night. Overall a great experience though.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	mWYs_cqTHUSL9wifDZkEkg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

They never brought more chips and salsa and they never refilled our drinks. Now, we never asked but having two daughters that work in the restaurant industry, I know what's expected. Would I go back? Probably not, unless I was with friends that wanted to go. I would much rather have SoCal Tacos right down the street for half the price and ten times better.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	o9wUrmOlSEg5aSfhSxN8aQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I stumbled upon a beautiful little money saving sign at the table for a lunch deal :) Any two tacos and half a salad or soup for $9.95. I ordered the shrimp and ahi taco. Both delicious of course. But I am here to praise about the fila salad. The fila salad blew my mouth and mind, it has kale as a base  with jicama, oranges, tomato, avocado, pinto beans, corn, crunchy peas + queso fresco in a quince vinaigrette. It's definitely worth a try! \n\nI had fantastic service. My water was not even a quarter empty and it was refilled, twice! The place had people in there but it was not during peak times or super busy by any means.

It's like a cozy little family in there! The patio/outdoor eating area is beautiful during the winter months and is a great hot spot during Happy Hour.\n\nPro tip - I (obviously) recommend The Standard. Plus, if you buy 3 tacos, you get a free side-dish, which I love. Their Blood Orange Mule is pretty awesome too!	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	d95RJTN_gsfmkEJtYv4juQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

When we finished our food we had to wait for over 20 min for someone to come back over. The waitress stated that she could not run our card due to her family being in town??? Yup, that's what she said! Another girl came ran our card and gave me a box to box my own food. Now the server that stated she could not run my card was able to come over to grab the tip though. Great food! It's just a shame that the service is going down.\n\nA manager by the name of Brad has since contacted me. He stated that he working on correcting the issue.

I ordered three tacos: the Standard (chicken, guac & a mild aji amarillo), the Crispy Fish (beer-battered fish & slaw), and the Shrimp. So.Good! With three tacos, you get a side, and we both got the Orange-Cucumber salad -- cukes sliced on the diagonal with pepitas. The food enhanced the company, which is always nice. And the restaurant provided a great vantage point to watch a very fast dust storm move in! Will be back.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	cLfnZCEdPRzjgaCnXD0new	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I can't give it a five, because the tacos just didn't merit a five... that said, the chips and salsa were spot on, as well as the carne asada quesadilla.  I love the ambiance and decor, and the service was really good.  In regards to the tacos, the main factor for me is the tortilla.  You can tell they were made fresh, but they were dry and a little bland.  They were white corn, which was cool, but I think the massa needed a little something.  I guess it was just meh - and when your joint is named after something specific, you should try to knock that outta the park.  Will I go back?  Yeah, but I'm not in a hurry to do so.	2	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	1fPiKjZhkGWLya1QLkwlhQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

It gets pretty busy on the weekends, but its worth a little bit of a wait. We usually only end up waiting like 15 min when it's most busy. \n\nEvery time we go we get the 3-taco deal, and an appetizer. Trust me, it's PLENTY of food. I think I've tried each of the tacos,  but my favorites are the fish and machaca ones. Also pro tip: you can switch out the corn tortillas for flour tortillas, when you're not feeling the corn. \n\nThe guacamole and queso are SO delish. I promise you won't regret getting either of them. I love this place and can't wait to see it's continued growth!	0	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	3Ak26YmQ8CMHVSc3LsFniw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The atmosphere is so inviting and comfortable..like hanging out in a friends cool backyard.\n\nStarted off with a cup or tortilla soup and Cheese y mas ( warm melted cheesy goodness), both of which were spot on.\n\nMe and my lover boy shared the fried fish taco & braised beef taco and he went all in for The Beast burrito and i went for the cochinita pibil torta. Let me tell you something, Im not usually a totra kinda girl but I switched it up yesterday & Im glad i did because the damn torta rocked my taste buds. We both had leftovers but devoured the rest as a late night snack. \n\nOh yeah, please do try the daily freshly made aguas frescas. \nRecommendation: Cucumber Mint spiked with tequila.

The atmosphere was very social and lively, a little loud but perfect for a Friday night. After ordering our drinks and looking over the menu, our server/barkeep informed us of the special they were serving. Slow roasted pork shoulder on a bed of sweet polenta, garnished with what tasted like pickled jalapeños and some sort of adobo sauce and cilantro. What ever it was it tasted like heaven, with huge complex flavors. The pork melted in your mouth, it was unreal. \n\nThe staff was very nice and even engaged us in light conversation which just added to the laid back ambience. When we finished eating we were approached by the manager and asked what we thought about the special. I relayed my enthusiasm and he said it was really nice to get positive feedback on non-menued dishes and would be serving more 1-offs in the future.\n\nOverall a fantastic experience. We will definitely return soon.	0	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	XYrx80ApgeT-GlJDQNpqBg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

How do you beat $2 tacos on happy hour and $5 margaritas? You don't. The crispy fish taco was amazing, it didn't have fish that was falling apart and the crispy exterior was just as satisfying as a bag of your favorite chips. Enchiladas had great flavor and everything from the meats to the tortillas were the exact texture that you look for in the two. Meats weren't too tough and neither were the tortillas. Our server Francisco was wonderful as well, great attitude, upbeat, kept it light and easy, and dished out subtle but amusing remarks. Will definitely be coming back.

XiywT03kOzq3pN8D70MhBw	4	2015-09-13 00:00:00	K and I visited this place a long time ago,  a couple weeks after they opened. We sat at the bar and let's just say, did not have the best experience. Tonight I met S, one of my AOB buds. He drove down from Scottsdale for his BDay and Joyride was his choice. \nWe got sat right away only because a table opened up. The place was otherwise full. Our server was Midori. She was awesome. She was attentive but not intrusive.\nJoyride is of course a member of the Upward Project family. Postino, Churn, The Windsor and Federal Pizza. This doesn't guarantee Joyride will be good but it does give it a head start. The menu consists of Appetizers, soups & salads, Taco's 11 ways, Burritos 4 ways, Chilaquiles and Enchiladas. Margaritas, beer & wine, Aguas Frescas plus various Tequilas. \nS and I started with a couple of margaritas. ($9 ea) S got the Prickly Pear and I got the Blood Orange. My Blood Orange margarita, made with Tequila, Triple Sec, Blood Orange sour and Hibiscus syrup was really tasty. The blood orange flavor stood out but was not overwhelming.\nS ordered The Beast Burrito ($10). It was filled with Carne Asada, Pinto Beans, Avocado and salsa. S enjoyed his burrito and said it was quite good.\nI ordered the Garden Variety Burrito ($8 + $2 for Red & Green sauce). This was seriously the best veggie burrito I have ever had. This thing was stuffed with Butternut and Chayote Squash, Spinach, Mushroom, Avocado, Corn, Queso, Tomatillo salsa, White Magic and Pico gringo. I could taste everything inside the tortilla. All the flavors mingled perfectly with each other. Now, I did order this with the red and green sauce. This was a recommendation from Midori. She was spot on. The sauce elevated this burrito to another level. Winner winner veggie burrito dinner.\nI did find a couple things that were no bueno. Their website says Happy Hour ends at 5pm. Midori said it ended at 6. It was after 6 so it didn't really matter either way but one of them was wrong. Hopefully it's the website because ending Happy Hour at 5pm would be a joke. Another thing that was not the best was the acoustics of the dining room. Why would the Upward Project design an interior that basically causes ALL the sounds to bounce around making it very hard to hear anything. Not impressed with that but the rest of the design is great.\nI would also like to add that the music that was playing was great. Dion and the Belmonts and The Beastie Boys to name a couple.\nGreat margarita, great food, great server, fair prices, great background music, lousy acoustics. 4 Stars	7	1	7	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	5UYjT5YDKSuApFax2t2eqg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I was somewhat apprehensive but having a good taco shop close by that doesn't look like its 50 years old was a must try.\n\nGlad we did.  We went in around noon today, Saturday and sat right away at the bar :) The salsa we got right away was great!  We ordered the tomatillo salsa and it was way to sweet for us but the rest of everything was wonderful\n\nI had the veggie taco which was a great mesh of veggies in a home made tortilla, was great.  DH had the carne asada and one of their pork tacos.  Said the carne asada was awesome as did one of the other guys sitting next to us.  \n\nAtmosphere is fun and inviting.  Pitcher was 7.5 which was great since each draft pint was $5.  All in all one of the cheaper lunches we've had in a fun place and the food was good.\n\nWe did have really good service and it was fast unlike some other reviews, maybe because we sat at the bar but definitely no complaints here.  Overall, really happy this place is close to us as we moved out here a few years ago from Scottsdale and have been waiting for a new favorite!	1	0	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	s3E_fnfAa0vew8JTNJveWw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Am I the only one who thinks that is weird? The tacos were ok but over all not really worth the price.  Drinks were decent.  The decor and atmosphere were great but there were a large amount of flies.  I think there would have been less trouble with flies if we ate outside.

These rank right up there. I thought only two tacos for sure I wont be full and will want more. I was pleasantly surprised on how full I was.

XU2XvwogmCbj0JlIxZBmHw	1	2014-01-07 00:00:00	I just want to shed light to the fact that this upward projects restaraunt concept is a complete ripoff of Gallo Blanco. I heard about this place through a friend who works at the gilbert location, they described it as one of AZ's "best Mexican fine dining places." Having previously worked for Gallo, I was curious about this new place I had never heard of before, but was apparently such a huge deal. So I did a little investigating. Much to my dismay, upon discovery of their menu I realized that many of the names of food dishes, even exact recipies had been stolen from Gallo Blanco. I can say this with 100% confidence because if you know anything about Gallo Blanco's owner, you would know that he is from Mecixo, he is a prominent chef, and his menu items are either entirely self-created, or as a collaboration with somebody who works for/with him. His food is authentic to Mexico City as you will get this side of the border. So you see how it might have come as a shock when I noticed items on Joyride's menu like steamed jasmine rice with tomatillo salsa as a garnish: this item was on the menu at Gallo Blanco for 4 years because the owner's mother (who is of partial Japanese descent) would serve rice to him in that way when he was growing up in Mexico. Tsktsk Joyride, I see what you're doing.\n It's not about competing restaraunts,I'm sure that Joyride Central will come to it's own success as Gallo continues to grow, I'm just upset to have stumbled upon such an ugly expose of how people choose to make money. I've been a patron at Windsor, Postino, and Federal Pizza on numerous occasions; Upward must be doing something right, and making a lot of money doing it. But this Joyride thing is low, and upward people should be ashmed that rather than develop a creative food idea for themselves, they'd rather hire a good interior decorator, steal food concepts, and try to out-compete the original creator of the ideas they are attempting to capitalize on.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	8COmdQkgR9D1M6q7oIhYAw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Everything I had was insanely good. I love the funk decor, great music, very friendly (and good looking) staff. Service was quick! There's outdoor and indoor seating- it's comfortable and aesthetically pleasing. The food was yum. Yum YUM!! I had 3 tacos- braised beef, Tinga, and pork. First off all it's awesome that they even have Tinga on their menu. But the fact that it was good?! I'm grateful for being so tired after work to make this restaurant mistake. Oh!!! They serve aguas frescas too- they're take on them anyway. I had a cucumber one and I wish I had that recipe.

While we waited we sipped on their margaritas and horchatas. I loved the cucumber Serrano pepper margarita, I was made just perfect for my taste. Almond horchata was too cinnamony though. The highlight of the food was their Mexican street corn. Fantabulous !!! Tacos were good but nothing extraordinary. Crispy fish taco and chicken Tinga were the best amongst the ones we tried.

We followed the suggested mixings (ie gin and citrus agua fresca), and they were dead on.\n\nThe band was fun and loud but not too loud. \n\nWe had the ahi stack, which tasted very fresh.

YBco0YUO5scyI0t8wPJxlA	2	2015-06-02 00:00:00	Joyride, what are you doing? I was just about to update my review to reflect a much more positive experience but you had to go and let me down again. \n\nI'm way happier with your food. Garden Variety Burrito is so delicious with the roasted mushrooms, squash, spinach, tomatoes, and corn combined with avocado, queso and "magic" sauce make the burrito just the right amount of healthy-unhealthy, especially if you get it chime style. I'd highly suggest getting it chime style or enchilada style by adding red/green sauce. And you give unlimited chips -- Yes, please!!\n\nHowever, amazing food can be over shadowed.  On 5/30/15 in the "Gals" bathroom around 1:30-ish pm, the body of one little Ms. Coc K. Roach was not laid to rest. She was on her back, legs in the air, with no life left for anyone who used the bathroom to see. That's a pretty fast way to make someone lose an appetite. So gross! Check those bathrooms! \n\nThe service is finally solid with servers who are knowledgable about the menu and attentive. The food is pretty good but dead bugs in a restaurant, even in a bathroom, is something I would think should be top priority to get under control. They usually say "If there is one bug then there is..."\n \nAnd as per usual, splitting and getting the check proved to be difficult. Why don't you want to take our money? Please, I really do want to pay for my food and I typically like to do so in a timely fashion.  \n\nI hold out hope that one day this review can be sunshine and rainbows but for now it's meh and dead bugs.

It took almost 10 minutes just to get an iced tea. I was not impressed by the food for the price either. Furthermore, our server mixed up the cards for the split tabs and didn't even tell us about the mistake or even apologize. After talking to management they told me they were too busy to look into my issue and they would call me back when business died down, and never did. The only reason for more than one star on the review is because I called back again and the manager Sean looked into my issue and apologized on behalf of the rest of the staff.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	6OIZZd1gv4fVAnWKOOep2A	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
YejmGo7Mb4YxtxDqvE-wKA	4	2014-05-03 00:00:00	We went here on a Friday night at 5:45 so as expected we waited about 45 min to be seated.  In the meantime there were people bringing around chips and drinks so you could have something while you waited. There was lots of outdoor seating  (Adirondack style chairs with little tables) to hang out in while you waited and enjoyed your refreshments. They also have misters going to ward off some of the heat. Once seated service was a bit slow but once we had our order taken the food was out amazingly fast. I had carne asada tacos, no cilantro (always a test to see if they can handle specialty orders) and my husband had the beast. Both were very good. The salsa is a bit too hot for me and it came on my tacos so I drank a ton of coke.  My husband loved it,  he tends to like really spicy things.  Definitely a hipster staff but not so much that you feel out of place. Lots of families, older couples and young couples there on dates.  Decor is very nice also.  It is kind of loud,  I'm sensitive to that because my grandma has hearing aids, I would never be able to take her there unless we sat outside. Overall great place and we will be back.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	4pKDdD2OZSKC0uVCPB02Sw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
ygb0rQmFvfcKdgeIU5XpLg	1	2016-01-24 00:00:00	Went there on a Saturday night, service was terrible and it wasn't even busy. I tried to order to a mango margarita and was told that they didn't have those on the menu anymore. What!? You have margaritas and mango syrup and you can't make a mango margarita? So I order a soda and it took 10 minutes to get that. I ordered the Carne Asada tacos and it was dry and there was more onion than beef in it. Needless to say won't be returning.	2	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	ZkLIvVK-3Lud0ByIfwF6Cw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Best taco is carnitas, best margarita is the pear.. Just my humble opinion.\n\nGreat atmosphere and feels a bit like old town Scottsdale, except that the bartenders and staff actually give a crap about their patrons.\n\nCome and see for yourself!	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Q7dqyvvOYwjRf1qjZwLbCg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

One thing that was strange was that the sides came out on the flat appetizer dishes like they ran out of side dishes. I guess I just expected a better fish taco. \nWith so many options next door, tough to come back.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	8JPlt60FDTqYBSw-ETM2kQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Joyride has amazing food, amazing staff and the cutest decor! \n\nI like to sit outside on the patio- which often puts you at risk for being forgotten- but not here! The staff is bubbly, helpful and checks in often! \n\nEverything I have tried here has been gorgeous, the presentation and flavor of each dish makes it hard to choose- but my favorites right now are the standard chicken and baja fish tacos!\n\nI also would like decorate my house like that place haha! \nI think I will try the agua fresca next time :)	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	XgpUhKNgKgXFgARmgob3bA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Gave it a chance and WOW I was impressed with the quality of the tacos and other food they had.

ySlfbGwT4zFiTgZu0OMxsQ	3	2013-08-19 00:00:00	Trendy new place in downtown Gilbert, adjacent to the equallty trendy Postino.  Joyride has a good menu, and fresh ingredients.  The carne asada taco is excellent, as well as the fish taco.  \n\nThere area couple of reasons why I'm only giving three stars.  First, the atmosphere is trying to be very hip and trendy, which I found a bit of a turnoff.  The servers were friendly enough, but I just personally prefer a cozier ambiance, rather than feeling like I'm in downtown Scottsdale.\n\nAlso, I thought the prices were a little high.  They offer an excellent in-house salsa, but offer additional "premium" salsas for an additional charge.  I like trying different salsas, but found my choices to be fairly bland, and not as good as their house salsa.  The tacos are priced ok, though.\n\nJoyride is a decent restaurant, and I'd definitely try it again - but it didn't make me put it on my "must-return" list.	4	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	zmINlnFtqSZt_L2vLP48Fw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

She asked me what can I get since you don't like your food. I said nothing I'm fine. Then the manager came out and said I'm not leaving till I ordered something else and it would be on them. I ordered some braised beef tacos and they were amazing. The customer service I had tonight was AMAZING.  They went out of there way to make me happy.

Y_v4huycr24Bul8lk1j9Ng	3	2015-02-07 00:00:00	Pros:\nthe tacos!\nplenty of parking (maybe this is not a big deal for locals, but as an out of towner - always appreciate easy parking)\n\nfree chips and salsa.  Feel like this is a dying tradition.\n\nMixed:\nFrescas - Cumber Mint is delicious and refreshing. But I got their special, which was Mango, tasted like a weird watered down Mango Lassi.  He actually recommended it and when he asked me if I liked it, and I said, "my friend's cucumber mint is better" (as my passive aggressive way to change drinks) he sadly didn't bite.\n\nTIP: ask them to go light on the ice. Half the glass was ice, it was a bit much.\n\nmeh:\nCheese Y Mas - appetizer, on paper sounds great - but once ordered, was a bit disappointed.  I think I was hoping for something more like how adult mac 'n cheese when done righ can make me gladly fork over $14 for mac 'n cheese, or what restaurants have done to burgers to make them fancy. I was expecting a queso twist, but just got Velveeta. \n \nservice - started off attentive and friendly, and than ignored at the end, was so thirsty had to ask to drink some of my friend's water.\n\nEven though I'm giving it a 3 - I'd still come back.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	i1y_-2QqluZx_bGJUGtiQg	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

z2pc8JwyD5IxOEIDauvOOw	3	2017-07-11 00:00:00	Joyride is good, but not worth the price.\n\nEverything here is pricey. The tacos here are between $3.75 and $4.50, the small bowl of guacamole is $8 and the drinks are about $9. \n\nThey serve up a complimentary basket of chips, but charge you for refills. That INCLUDES the refill you need to eat the $8 guac you just ordered. Hard to believe the $8 doesn't include chips...\n\nThe food was tasty and the drinks were creative, but overall the experience didn't match the price.\n\nI recommend going during happy hour. Maybe then you can still afford rent!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	D_Wp2rzmeQ8Bj5S4Wx-z1A	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The bean and cheese burrito meal was made using taco tortillas. My 3 year old and 5 year old finished their meals before mine even came out (yes, all ordered at the same time) and were still hungry, so I asked to order two more burritos. They said they only sell the meal, so, $20 later ($5/meal x 2 kids x 2 meals), my kids were finally full.

The elote was over priced but was the only saving grace to this god awful place my boyfriend and I tried on a whim. Couldn't get a drink refill for the life of me, but after I'm finished with my meal the waitress decides to refill my drinks. $12 for a cardboard burrito. I enjoyed writing this painfully honest review more than I did the food. \n\nOn the bright side if you love dubstep and terrible remixes of Sam Smith and Adele you'll fit right in with the try hard atmosphere.	7	3	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	tKF1yuXc-kUtPNWgK9NGkw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

zCYW15OtLFxslHYfG5hDRQ	3	2013-10-18 00:00:00	You can't go to a taco place and not try the tacos right!? \n\nMy friend told me about this place and wanted to try it out. When you first sit down you get complementary chips and salsa. It was nothing special. It was a bit spicy for my taste. I ordered the carne asada tacos and the crispy fish taco. I wasn't too fond of the carne asada tacos. It was a bit dry and bland and I felt like it needed sauce or sour cream or something with it. The crispy fish tacos were really good though. Beer battered fish AND guacamole got me! lol. I washed everything down with the strawberry Agua Fresca. It was delicious! It has vodka, gin and rum in it. I'd like to try their "spiked" horchata next time I come. For dessert we ordered the churros con chocolate which was quite yummy. =)\n\nThe customer service was really good. We were always taken care of and the staff is very knowledgeable of their menu. \n\nThe only negative for me was there was no sign on the restaurant! I drove up and down the street for like 15 minutes and I couldn't find it. I had to call my friend to find out where it was. The only sign they have is on the door. Which is definitely not noticeable at night time. I know they are a new establishment but I felt like a huge sign should've been the first thing to take care of. I never would've found it at all. \n\nAll in all, I really liked their drinks and will probably come back during happy hour to try the rest of their drink menu. =)	6	1	5	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	GSvZ1ZJmVqQA9O2NVfO1TQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Our food was cold, my Sons soda was flat after two tries of two different kinds and it was still on the bill, the waitress reached right across my face mid bite to take my Sons plate away, the portions were ridiculous for a $5.00 street taco, the carne asada taco tasted like it should have been a hawaiian taco, the shrimp tacoâ¦..what shrimp, the guacamole was bland, the chips were stale, the margarita was weak, the beans were runny, the grilled vegetables were cold with a blob of tomato paste thrown atop; the meal all around for a family of 4 @ $80.00 was HORRIBLE!!!

I asked for her name and she said "I go by Fergie here at work." She took us outside and made sure everything was right! We let her know our table was wobbly and asked if there was anything she could do about it. She immediately fixed it for us and recommended the Sloe Ride margarita when we asked her which one was the best!

ZNY0iqGiI6MPUcwQvGeAww	1	2013-06-12 00:00:00	I was happy to see a new restaurant finally move into the space next to Postino, so when it opened, my wife and I had to try it. I have to say the service and drinks were great, but the food was quite a disappointment. The chicken burrito my wife ordered was filled with over grilled vegetables, very little chicken and wrapped in a tough flour tortilla. The only flavor detected was that of roasted corn. I was equally disappointed in the tacos I ordered. I tried both the shrimp and the chef special scallop. The corn tortillas were grilled until stiff and dry. The shrimp and scallop were plentiful, but again lacked any kind of flavor. If you want to try any salsa other than the bland house kind, it will cost you two dollars extra. Not worth the cost, when you consider you would have to eat it with the generic tortilla chips they serve. The one bright spot was the Mexican street corn. It was very good. Overall, I would say skip this trendy spot and go across the street for much better food at half the price.	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	HGt9WR2yjGB3Tf5dTiNU1A	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

ZRehOzxG43SP67ZxqLeNQA	4	2015-02-05 00:00:00	Joyride's Gilbert location started out strong on the burgeoning downtown Gilbert Main Street as one of the best places for trendy Mexicana in the east valley. My first experience there was phenomenal as I was given the full rundown of the menu and even a sample of some of their newer tacos. Since then, it has become a regular spot for myself and my Gilbert dwelling friends to enjoy an afternoon repast of beer and fish tacos. The atmosphere is great, the wait staff is friendly and attractive, and the music they play never disappoints. \n\nI give four stars rather than five however, because over the last year or so, some of their recipes have undergone some changes. To this day there are a few dishes that remain inconstant, and some of my personal favorites like their pulled pork torta have been removed altogether. \n\nDon't fix what ain't broke, joyride!	1	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	pyUCjXtEgKjIAQ_FYXQA7g	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Set in the heart of downtown Gilbert, Joyride is a great take on street tacos.\n\nWe started with the free chips and salsa (second order only $2) and some ceviche. The size of the salsa and ceviche was small and wasn't enough for two people.\n\nOrdered three different tacos and a side of cucumber orange salad.  All tacos were good and the salad was excellent.  We ordered the fish taco, but they were out of it. Guess I should have went down the street if I wanted fish tacos.\n\nThe drinks are probably Joyride's best menu choice. We had the Cucumber Mint Agua Fresca.  Definitely our best decision.\n\nWith all the wonderful choices in downtown Gilbert Joyride is a good eatery, better drinkery, with five star service.\n\nStop by if you're into chips, salsa, street tacos, and delicious drinks.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	r_mcUkSxZ-QuBFKbt40TCA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

zwk0PMq4fuURMdx4PtHbCw	4	2014-02-24 00:00:00	Finally tried this place today and was not disappointed! Sunday afternoon, nice weather and they were packed! Ordered a shrimp and a fish taco and they were very good, fresh ingredients and they were just the right size. Salsa is very good, but if you want more spice ask for the habanero version. My only complaint is that they don't have full sized pitchers of beer...small ones at about 2.5 pints each. However, that being said it was happy hour (we were there about 1pm) and they were only $5 so all is forgiven. I like that you can sit outside and the back outside patio has a large grass area so if you bring your kids they can lounge around and not bother anyone as it is not right next to any tables.

This is not a good place for large groups... they can put a few tables together on the small patio outside but unless it is one of the few nice days of the year in Arizona, you won't be comfortable. Also, the wait can be really long. Ask them about an app you can download on your phone and you can put your name in at a restaurant and they are one of them. I forgot what it is called. The wait will very likely be 1-2 hours wait on Friday and Saturday nights. Brunch there is fun too though!	1	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	0zLBlyceytzueaUtGvRAMQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

I can't wait to come back and have some more great tasting tacos!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	zXBH5QYe1WJCvQdkYBs9JQ	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

We were both very hungry but knew joyride had good reviews so we went to put our name on the waitlist. Hubby got a little cranky because there was a long wait but we were seated out on their back patio, it was so beautiful with the trees and lights! Once our food arrived he admitted that the wait was well worth it and the food was amazing!	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	Pc0aDuSxEr_yD_NPJUn2Yw	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

Wow is all I can say. It is hot (it is habanero after all) but that charred part just adds some super flavor to it. The staff was super friendly and as we waited for a table outside they had a server taking and bringing drink orders. That is awesome and all restaurants should be that way.

I wasn't a huge fan of the chicken taco but we tried the carnitas, the other pork option that I can't recall the name of and the carne asada and those were all really good. The guac was also good. I really like the outdoor area and will love to try it out when it cools down. The interior is small, but comfortable.

The waits are often long for a table but we're usually lucky enough to find a spot at the bar.\n\nWe've never been disappointed with the food.  Most of the time, it's really good and occasionally, amazing.  The house cocktails, while not classic, are good in a spiked fruit juice kind of way.\n\nThe atmosphere is awesome.  Bustling but not overly loud.  When the weather is nice, the patio is a nice option.  The music is right in my wheelhouse.  \n\nPrices are fair and sometimes a bargain.  For instance, they do a 32 ounce pitcher of draft beer for somewhere around $7.  The beer selection, while not terribly craft-centric, has a few good choices, i.e. Dale's.	0	0	0	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	fV9dnQcFDdA0nAQ-Aa9QTA	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg
_NBLFL1AueV9p1MwA_kDlA	4	2014-09-22 00:00:00	Great place. Great food. Great drinks. Great atmosphere.  They start you off with chips and salsa which I can't get enough of because it's all fresh.  I usually order the tacos and really like the chicken tinga, braised beef, crispy fish, and carnita. Carnitas is definitely my favorite and I think it's the most flavorful out of the bunch.  I've had a couple of other things off their menu as well, like one of the burritos and enchilada, and everything was good.  One thing I have to say is if you get the Mexican corn (which is also good) be prepared to have it on the cob, it's not in a cup, which is what I was expecting. I'm also big on mezcal so I always get the Naked and Famous, but ask them to make it extra smoky (i.e. with more mezcal) and it always tastes great. Atmosphere is nice and relaxed and we've always been able to find a bar seat or a table so you rarely have to wait (a huge plus) and service is fast.	1	1	1	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg	qtTJ7It35np4K14KOPLU1w	901	-6tvduBzjLI1ISfs3F_qTg

The layout is really strange in these, so try and request for a separate table if you can.\nPeak hours can leave you waiting for a while...so plan for that.\n\nIn terms of the food, I have to give it a 4/5 as well since it does quite well to satisfy your taste buds if you know what to order. I'm not saying it goes for authentic thai or anything, but it does leave you satisfied after. I generally prefer the curries with 5 chillies (I have a high tolerance for spice).	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	IZmx7AxIH3LeI1QMsrOAcQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The phad thai noodles was a bit too starchy, I think they should run it under a little bit of water. There was a fair quantity of shrimp in the phad thai. One more thing was that I found the spiciness a bit inconsistant. I ordered a mild and medium dish, but the mild was hotter than the medium. I will return once in a while.	0	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	vaMqZynnyCbQ684fPUq0Og	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

-OEvuTuZEU2mNUp4EqoajQ	5	2015-08-30 00:00:00	I've been here on several occasions since it's conveniently located near the Eaton Centre. We were seated promptly despite how crowded it was due to good organization.  It was a place where it was loud so you dine and head out quickly. I also found it hilarious that there were a lot of witty texts on the wall as part of their decoration. There were lots of stalls for the washroom which is a plus. \n\nMy most to least favourite: \n\nGreen Curry - Beef $8.75 Chicken $9.00 \n(broccoli, snap pea, bell pepper, pea, sweet Asian basil in Thai green curry with coconut milk and Thai herbs, served with steam rice)\nYou can choose the spice level which is really great too. It was a very light curry that primarily had a coconut milk taste so it was really creamy and delicious. The jasmine rice is really well made. \n\nCrispy Spring Rolls ~$4.00\n(cabbage, bean sprout, carrot, bean vermicelli, black fungus, bamboo shoot, wrapped in spring roll shell (made from wheat), deep fried, served with sweet and sour sauce)\nThey're good. You can't go wrong with these. :) If you grab one of those hole-punched card coupons you find at almost any hotel or tourist destination, these can be complimentary with your meal. \n\nThai Noodle Soup ~$7.95\n(rice noodle, chicken, shrimp, bean sprout, carrot, onion, coriander and celery in a light chicken broth) had more subtle flavours but was refreshing and I didn't feel thirsty afterwards like with a lot of noodle soups. It's good for a sick day if anything.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	1nTGhcG7qqL4qNR8pBwc3w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The first time I was there (2 years ago), service was great but the last 3 times I was there, service was very SLOW. If you're not in a rush, it's fine but if you're on a schedule, this is something you need to consider.\n\nIn terms of food, I love their stir-fry noodles! It's very delicious! But their noodle soups are very bad!! I only bought it once and ended up not finishing it... It was extremely sour. So advice here: get their stir-fry noodles or curry! Stay away from their noodle soups! \n\nOverall, I do recommend the place to just try out because they do have good food!

But was surprised that it was a trendy fast food Thai place. Upbeat decor and good value for the price.\n\nReliable Thai food though sometimes the spicy scale isn't precise. Somewhere from medium to three peppers is fine for most people and anything higher might give you an ulcer.\n\nBest dishes: The pad thai, basil noodles, peanut sauce, and mango salad. \n\nMeh dishes: The beef satay was dry, the shrimp appetizer was tiny and like snacks from the frozen food aisle.	0	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	kRSm3Y3DdfIM7etuY4APhg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Super busy, and super fast - the energy inside is almost overwhleming.\n\nThe food is okay. I was disapointed with the tastes, flavours and quality of food because the prices aren't cheap. The entrees are priced just like any other higher end Thai place which makes it really frustrating to eat poorer quality of food here and pay their prices.\n\nIf i had nowhere else to go and was craving food - i think i would make it myself before returning here.	3	0	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ZzA0SBWKSRJA8y5tlszrjQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It's just a great place to have a quick, inexpensive and flavourful meal. My favourite dish is the pattaya chicken - crispy fried, breaded chicken in delicious sweet lime sauce. The dish must be cooked just right however, I've gotten it soggy and cold a couple of times. I also have the green curry chicken from time to time - it is a perfect consistency and very tasty! The food is always served to you in lighting speed, which is great because there is often a line up of people waiting for a table. My favourite thing about this restaurant is that you can choose your own spice level. I usually go for 15-20 chillies... insane, right? I know, I'm addicted to spice. The servers are all really nice as well, I've never had a bad experience here.\n\nMy only complaint about this restaurant is the seating - it's quite busy and you often end up elbow to elbow with strangers sharing your table ~ a little loud and awkward at times. That being said, I would probably sit on someone's lap to eat here if I had to - the food is that good!\n\nIt is definitely worth trying this restaurant out and I have recommended it to many friends with great results. We took my partner's parents here when they visited from Ireland, and it was the only restaurant they requested to revisit during the week!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	mu0HokS1Ly9_QZDRHEPQ8A	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Not outstanding, but then again, this is no place to expect outstanding. The noodles were pretty yummy. I didn't quite get what makes them Islamic, but that didn't stop me from enjoying them.

0a-37ZAe_aoQbZO-YCSVEQ	4	2014-12-22 00:00:00	I came to this place without any expectations, not even knowing it was a Thai food place. It's not hard to find, since there's like a big protruding sign at the front, but you have to go up two flights of stairs once you step through the front doors, which threw me off a little.\n\nIt's a very open concept kind of dining experience, looks a bit like a canteen with like long metal tables and wooden seats. I came with one other person, and I guess we were lucky that the table beside us remained empty the whole time. Although I don't think it would have been a big deal sitting beside a stranger.\n\nI ordered the Siam Noodle which I guess is similar to Pad Thai except for the sauce - the sauce was made from peanut and coconut milk and was so fragrant and delicious! I really enjoyed it and thought it was super interesting. It was $9.75 for my noodles (I got them with chicken) and the portion was pretty big, I had a really hard time finishing and felt like I got my money's worth. I also like that you can customize the spice level of any of the dishes here - good for people like me who can't handle the heat.\n\nGiven the setup of the restaurant, it is pretty loud, I wouldn't really recommend this place for like, a first date or anything, since it can make it a bit difficult to hold a conversation. Other than that, service was friendly and attentive, food came out reasonably fast, and I thought it was a pretty good lunch experience!	0	0	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	QlRsVCCytArycuuKSyUBLg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
0aJHpMxdnK_hviP1lUZr1w	5	2012-01-21 00:00:00	For this price range and level of service I can't think of a better Thai place in Toronto! They moved down the street onto Yonge (after the last building collapsed and it was closed for ages, which made me very sad) so don't be confused by the location/exterior photos on Yelp (the address is correct, and it's now upstairs). The flavour of their curries and sauces are amazing, full bodied and well rounded, and the fact that you can customize your spicy level is perfect (my boyfriend is a wimpy when it comes to spice, so its nice we can both enjoy what we like). The service is always quick and friendly, and they've taken it up a style notch (including in the washrooms) at the new location. They still have the shared cafeteria style bench seating as a large part of the restaurant, which I think is a great use of space and fun (although I've heard others complain...you can always wait for a 'regular' table).  There are downsides, but I'm willing to live with all of them for the great food and a great price. They don't deliver - when I lived in the 'hood I'm sure I would have single handedly given them enough business to make doing so worthwhile ;) Also, during the Ryerson school year it gets crazy at lunch, and on weekends you can sometimes have to wait awhile for a table. Also sometimes I find that they aren't consistent with their spice scale. I usually get 3 or 5 chillies depending on my mood and the dish (ie does it come with white rice) but sometimes it seems more or less spicy...but again a gamble I'll take any day here!	2	1	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	LSDjqkMGd1W5r18JEVn7zQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Boy, I missed their food.  \n\nThere weren't that many people that day (possibly because not many people knew about their soft opening - all hail twitter!).  It was half an hour before closing time and we managed to grab a seat (actually there were many seats).  However, I heard from my friend today that he went at lunch for take-out and that there were so many people that they ran out of tofu\n\nThe hostess was a little off her game - but it was the soft opening.  I can't complain.  Our waitress greeted us with a friendly smile and was great.\n\nThe décor is pretty interesting - my friend and I were giggling at the sayings/words on the wall.  I think they were trying to go for the funky, but instead, it was a bit tacky - but still enjoyable.  The seats are pretty interesting - you can put your jackets/purses under the seat.  However, they were a bit difficult to stuff your stuff underneath and to take it back out afterward.\n\nI ordered myself the Thai Islamic Noodles - not on the menu; it's like they have a secret menu or something.  The most delicious thing you'll ever eat.  It's basically rice noodles with their panang curry.  You seriously cannot go wrong with this dish at all.  My hankering for Thai Islamic Noodles has now been satisfied and I need not to head to Linda for it anymore.\n\nI'm just so glad that Salad King is back and running!

Personally, I think this neighborhood is a bit lacking in decent eats that are affordable or especially good.  Salad King fits the bill nicely.  Really yummy vegetarian selection - and something for the carnivores too!  The only irritating thing about this place is the seating, it tends to be a little too cozy for me.  But, there are some seats that are a little more private, which I appreciate.	0	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Ahix-3uCOXmeaTUv0xF_zw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

But there is a racist mural on the wall that mocks stereotypes of the way Chinese people speak English (pronouncing l instead of r, for example). That's unacceptable and loses my business.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	b7utMBjtW6zuGboKuIXBFg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
1SxALbPQ5cruf_KRblUIuQ	3	2013-03-10 00:00:00	When I first came to Canada 4 years ago everyone raved about Salad King and how wonderful the food was. I tried it but didn't find it at all satisfying. I tried it again recently thinking that my pallet would be more refined and I could appreciate the food everyone seemed to love. Had the beef golden curry - not the best i've ever had and not something I would come back for. Other than that everything else was mediocre, the new remodel didn't wow me and seems a bit out of place but I liked that they thought about baskets under the chairs for peoples belongings. Not that the place was terrible, but it wouldn't be a thought in my mind to consider for next time.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	IJ4zyaljsPQoi4CxuZTVmQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Their portions are huge, taste is great, servers are friendly and helpful even if they aren't your designated server. \n\nI came on a Friday evening with some friends and waited approximately five minutes before we got seated in a booth. Our servers came with water within minutes of us sitting down. We sat comfortably in a booth which was much more spacious compared to their stainless steel seating area. We ordered a mango salad ($6.50), Islamic noodles with chicken ($11.50 - its on their secret menu), and a golden curry with beef ($10.10). Everything was ordered with medium spice as my friends aren't a huge fan of spicy foods. As per usual, the food came out shortly after we ordered and everything was delicious (and very fairly priced). I especially enjoyed the fresh mangoes they used in the mango salad. We requested the sauce and peanuts to be served on the side to accommodate our different preferences in mango to sauce and peanut ratio. I also admired their ability to have keep their meats tender as some Thai places over cook the chicken or beef which makes it less pleasant to eat. \n\nOverall experience was great, food was great, service was great, and it's super affordable ! I can't wait to come back again !	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	SnOOzQ1ReZuqXbyZ9glgCw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

240ACOKxoFBCPjqRa35JEA	2	2015-07-08 00:00:00	I've been to Salad King at least a handful of times before over a handful of years too. It was alright and economical the first time or two... Then after trying a few more items, I didn't find it special or anything at all. It's like Thai Express but in a fast casual setting. If you want authentic Thai, for sure go to Pai. Pai's been my fave since the first time I've been. If I wanted Thai food that's there I'd go.\n\nAnyways for convenience sake and because one of the friends I'm meeting up with actually likes the place, I ended up at Salad King... This time I wanted some noodle dish and ordered the khao soi just to see how it is.... For $8.75+tax, you'd be very full from it. But I rather pay 5 bucks more and go to Pai....... The friend that likes Salad King says she only ever gets the Sea Queen (fried squid with rice) or the Pad Thai... So ya, if you ever have to eat here, maybe those are the best bets...	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	NiCvYagD7M-YcRcam5ZMbg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

My spouse loves the orange beef and mango salad.  This is not a romantic restaurant or a good destination for a special event, it is great for a fast meal.\n\nIt is also a good destination if you are with a group of people and there is a person who does not love Thai food.  The menu is diverse enough that they will find something they will like.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	MTlryE2Jj1v94CEsI2Q_iA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
268zUQLF1rkobsdM3AEVwA	4	2013-10-30 00:00:00	Today I'll be reviewing Salad King.\n\nI've tried this restaurant about 6x and it's fairly consistent. The name is misleading as it's NOT a salad place. It's actually specializes in Thai Food.\nWhen I'm downtown and hungry for something tasty, filling and that won't cost much this is the place to go.\n\nThis place is ALWAYS packed. Every time I go there, it's chaotic and crammed. If you have a problem sitting in close quarters with strangers then I wouldn't suggest coming here. If you do not like loud busy places where it seems like the staff is ALWAYS moving at the speed of lighting...this spot is NOT for you. If you want your dish presented along with the rest of your party...NOT the spot for you. They bring your dishes out sporadically so no waiting until everyone is served to eat. If you do that, your food will be cold.\n\nThe food though is ALWAYS ALWAYS DELICIOUS! From the garlic shrimp, spring rolls to the 3 different styles of curries...you will NOT be disappointed. I always eat half and have some for leftovers. On the menu it has heat levels so you can ask for how spicy you want it. I enjoy spicy dishes so 3 was perfect for me. One time I decided to be brave and got heat level 5 and it was TOO much. To the point where I couldn't enjoy it. It's a great spot for plate sharing or just having your own dish. Appetizers range from about $4.00- $8.00 and the meals it's self are usually under $10.	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	oaAE5gKSQLT9x7Zp-Dn2xw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
29O-o7x73ydscMraPMO0Ig	4	2014-09-19 00:00:00	If you're looking for somewhere pretty cheap and pretty tasty downtown, this would be my go-to. I've always found something on the menu no matter what I'm feeling. I usually opt for the Thai Fried Rice. My usual friend group love the Islamic Noodles (an item on their "secret" off-menu, which I also recommend). My bill usually comes to about $12-15, with tip.\n\nThey're super busy during peak hours, but I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes even then. be aware than if you're a group of 1-3 people, you'll probably be seated in the section with long silver tables, kind of like a school cafeteria. I've never found that it hinders on conversation or general experience, but it's something that might bug people. 4+ usually get seated in a booth, which are nice and separate from the "communal" area. \n\nStaff are meet the basic friendliness quota, though sometimes service can be slow, or you'll have to flag down someone for something you've already asked for. That aside, I've usually found them attentive and they check in with you often.\n\nOverall, I like this place and frequent it a lot and will probably continue doing so.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	uJL7LxlTWy0QpVHBtqrefA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The location definitely blown me away - it was MASSIVE, who knew they had such a large space in the heart of downtown Toronto. I love to stick to the stuff I love and that always leads me to order Pad Thai when I'm here and it never fails me. The portions are definitely big and you should consider sharing a dish with someone if you have a tiny stomach like me.\n\nBeautiful location. Great service. Reasonably (and cheap) priced.

2iNTyCt2uXvsdKeuvbH1ig	2	2016-09-16 00:00:00	I ordered food from the Salad King food truck as it was near my work, and not being a Toronto native, was unaware of the restaurants supposed long history. 15$ got me a cucumber salad and a green chicken curry with rice. Overall I found the food disappointing and rather tasteless. 9 dollars seems like large sum for a curry dish that is truthfully very cheap to make. The vegetables in the curry tasted horribly overcooked and there was very little chicken in it at all. There was lots of white rice though. The cucumber salad was alright, I mostly enjoyed it because I really like cucumber, basil and peanuts already, but aside from these ingredients there wasn't much else happening. At this point in time there are so many more flavorful options in Toronto for the same price point or less in this style of food that I'm puzzled as to how this place still stays in business. Truthfully, I feel i could have gotten the same experience from a frozen TV dinner.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	898AQwsw7_EiY_xC2god7w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
2J2dMDprMiwWoGlF5M8qHA	4	2013-08-01 00:00:00	This popular restaurant located just North of Yonge/Dundas area offers a variety of delicious Thai dishes at a very affordable price.  It's no wonder why Salad King the go-to place for Ryerson University and other college students.  There's usually a line up but the servers are very efficient and you never wait too long.\n\nKhao Soi Noodle Soup - Egg noodles, chicken, bean sprout, shallot, shrimp, lime in coconut curry soup.  This soup is very hearty and is not too overwhelming with curry and spice.\n\nThe Islamic Noodles, which isn't on the normal menu has green pepper, chicken, onions, mushroom, carrots and rice noodles in peanut coconut sauce.  Its super saucy and flavourful - definitely a favourite from this place!  I couldn't get enough of this.\n\nShrimp with Cashew came with a side bowl of jasmine rice.  Even though this was 3 chili spiciness, it was too spicy for me.  The combination of cashews and shrimp was very delicious though. If it was less spicy, I would have enjoyed it more.\n\nI love that you can adjust the spiciness level to your taste.  I woud recommend their Islamic Noodles and other noodle dishes.  I like them more than specialty seafood dishes you get with a side of rice.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	7OURjtceW40mhpRX9P2dDg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
2L7YlvJGHi_Im6S_I7eT2g	3	2012-04-25 00:00:00	I loved the Pad Thai. But I'm a bit biased with that food. I like it pretty much everywhere. \n\nThe mango chicken dish was disappointing though. Cooking mango does not taste good. You're better off consuming it cold in a drink, or straight from the fridge. \n\nThe service was okay. My server had a funny tone to her voice, and walked away after I inquired about the unlisted Islamic Noodles (Pad Thai with curry sauce drenched over it, according to her). She brought the food out fast though, so props for that.\n\nIn summary, this place isn't that great, but it isn't bad. Good to go to if you're in the area, but not worth travelling a far distance just to get there.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	DESiAQFZ1Z5phDcae2Aj0Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
2lhW_dqWr8d3aPDFh7gKFw	3	2014-09-24 00:00:00	So I finally got to check this place out after hearing about all the hype from friends. It's right across from Ryerson and has a small entrace with "Salad King" on top. You'd have to walk up a flight upstairs since the restaurant is located on the second floor.\n\nI was reading the reviews on yelp and the Islamic noodles were recommened. So my friend and I gave it a shot. The hint of spice added a good taste to it however, I found it to be a tad bit too sweet. You can definitely tatse the coconut milk in the sauce. Overall, it was a good dish. \nWe also ordered the Bangkok Stir Fry noodles. Nothing special in taste. Just glass noodles stir fried with assorted veges and chicken (or shrimp, if you like shrimp). \nThe Thai Ice tea had a distinctive taste to it; it tasted more like a milk tea than ice tea. Also, it can get awfully loud which is quite hard to maintain a conversation. \n\nService was attentive and the food came pretty fast. However, I was turned off with our server's manner. He brought my friend and I a plate and my plate looked a bit dirty. He rubbed it with his fingers then handed it to me.. At first I thought it was just a scratch on the plate but when I tried cleaning it with my napkin.. It was actually residue. This makes me question their sanitary level in the kitchen...\n\nI just felt that the food does not reflect the high volume of hype its getting...	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	wL1-nb9MQrJFQXqpZsO5mg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
2njjRg8Wl2pnGTw3tG6EvQ	3	2016-01-27 00:00:00	I've always wanted to try Salad King, as I work near this place, but I only get a 30 minute lunch break.  I decided to use my free credits with the Ritual app, so that I could order takeout.\n\nThe process was seamless and took me 1 minute to complete.  The estimated time they gave me initially was 20 minutes, but it got reduced to ~12.5 minutes from the time I ordered.  When I arrived, everything was ready to go - I literally walked up to the counter, told them my name/I ordered via Ritual, they gave me my food, I dipped - We're living in the future, confirmed.\n\nI ordered the Pineapple Chicken for $9.75 but got an additional 20% off for using the app.  They gave me the chicken, sauce, veggies, pineapple in 1 container, and a buttload of steamed rice in another container.  The meal itself was okay - nothing to rave about, but the portion size was pretty substantial.  The sauce tasted like sweet fake syrup.  This dish was recommended as one of the most popular on the app, and so I ordered it impulsively - next time I'll check Yelp first.\n\nThough I was underwhelmed by the food, the service was efficient and worked flawlessly.  The long tables in the restaurant are perfect to eat a casual lunch with friends.  I will likely give Salad King another chance to reclaim its throne which resides on my taste buds.	2	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	crsofThakzXFjJLr9q1mWQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

What's great is that they offer a variety of spiciness levels so you can judge yourself how you would like the dish to be.\n\nUpdate: Be careful with the optional spiciness level. It is not consistent with different chefs. Also, I brought a foodie friend that said the spiciness is from a synthetic food additive. Now, I can't tell the difference, but what's interesting is that when you ask them to give you the spicy flavouring on the side, they refuse.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	UxTh0zFCbHj2PDxDa0aikQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Nothing "omg I eat here every time i'm in the Yonge/Dundas area!!" but a pretty solid option. \n\nPROS:\n- Pretty cheap\n- Very nice modern facilities\n- Loads of menu options and they are helpful with customising for those with dietary fusses.\n- Communal tables are great for individuals/pairs \n- TASTY TASTY CHILLI NOMS. Ask for a pot of chili for your table too, just to add more insanity.\n\nCONS:\n- No reservations and no turning up a little early to grab a table while you wait for your dining companions\n- Can sometimes take a while to get a server's attention, and the wait times for meals at lunch can be not so snappy\n- I know the "vegetable lovers" section isn't specifically labelled vegetarian, but it would be nice to have a mention somewhere that some of these don't have the option of removing fish sauce. (A pro related to this is if you ask nicely the server will very helpfully point out what on the menu CAN have fish sauce removed to make it vegetarian).\n\n\nI won't make a trip to the area specifically for this, and it's certainly not the most tastebud-blowing Thai food i've had, but it's good to have as an option in the Y&D area.	3	1	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	zh7csWc3GAUksnShzGp-WQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

316Mb874of4i7wzqt1xqBw	3	2014-06-17 00:00:00	I go to Salad King a lot, because of its close proximity to my school. The place is always packed and fairly busy consistently through out the day. The food is definetely good but doesn't warrant a 4 star in my books. I love the chilli system, which allows the patrons to choose how spicy they want their food. It can often turn into a battle between friends of who can handle more chillis. I think next time I want to try ten! One of my favourite dishes is the Golden curry, it is rich, creamy, slightly sweet and full of flavour. The mango salad is ok and so is the papaya salad because I have had better. The pad thai is good but not the best. Last time I tried the thai tea with milk and sugar after my meal, and it tasted interesting in a good way. It was definetly a type of team I had never had before. The seating situation is quiet tight so I will recommend going here before you go shopping . I am not sure if I will get in trouble for saying this, but they apparently have a secret menu, which are dishes not on the menu. My friend last time ordred the Islamic noodles with is curry noodles, a part of the secret menu.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	pZsVUkMb4yGMGoTRzNS7Ew	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Throughout my freshman year, I thought Salad King was a salad store in the Eaton's Centre food court. Imagine my surprise when I finally decided to join my friends for dinner here one day. 1. It was never located in the Eaton's Centre. 2. Their specialty lies in Thai Food, NOT salads. \n\nI'm pretty sure I tried every single item on their menu, with the old location (before the fire) being located conveniently close to all my lecture halls. Since graduating and it's move to the new location, I haven't visited Salad King much. But one this is for certain, the food still tastes great! \n\nI'm always a sucker for the Islamic Noodles. If you haven't tried it yet, I highly recommend! Imagine Pad Thai meets Coconut Curry Sauce + wholesome nutty flavour heaven. That's what you'll get when you order the Islamic Noodles.	1	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	7N0DIpQfnwrLt7htDGKSIw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

No smiles and no greetings. \nOur waitress was however very friendly. Attentive and gave us what we needed just in time. \n\nFood has been consistent. Seafood fried rice was overly sweet. Other items were decent. One kid enjoyed the food but the younger one was not a fan. Restaurant is always loud. Can barely carry out a conversation. I think that's their intention, to get you in and out quick so they can turn over the tables fast.\n\nOne thing that has always been strange is their "bleach flavoured water."

3JspFeD8HCmRxTvyD95Z0Q	4	2014-10-29 00:00:00	I am almost sure every Ryerson student has been here before, and there is a reason for that. Salad King is very consistent with their proportions and taste unlike some other restaurants. \n\nI am a regular here as the food does not keep me bloated and thirsty like many restaurants that price their foods at around this price, and this probably means that Salad King does not use much MSG. \n\nPersonally my favourite dishes are the stir fry noodles although I don't feel like there is enough quantity for it's price. I never am really fully satisfied because although the food itself is very good, I am unable to be full from their food proportions whether it be noodles or curry with rice (which leads me into my next point). The curry with rice is immensely disproportionate. Unless I am somehow eating it wrong there is honestly not enough rice to even finish a quarter of the curry, unless you completely drench the rice. The taste of the golden curry is phenomenal but I am always forced to order extra rice with the curries, or extra noodles for the stir-fry dishes (which I don't recommend, they do not add any extra sauce which in turn makes the noodles lose its rich flavour - can't blame them though, I really only am paying for the extra rice/noodles).\n\nOverall this place has really great food and service, although I am never satisfied with the proportions thus it deserves a 4-star.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	CrddlpoEWvbCMkaRCr7nNA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It ended up being so hot I could not finish even 20% of the plate! It's not that I can't handle spicy food, since I've had their 10 chili dishes before, but it was horrible that the "mild" that I specifically asked for was even hotter than 10-chili.\n\nI asked the waitress if my order was correct, and the answer was "well, the chefs are not consistent", and did not even offer to prepare a new plate (heck, I would have been happy with getting a bowl of white rice just to dilute the fried rice down).\n\nSo no, don't go to Salad King any more. I used to be good sometimes, not anymore.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	hoNtBG3OMaZ4Ak-SIRO-wQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

3mZqn0ofhm1HBykiH3hBFA	4	2016-01-16 00:00:00	Friday night, I was looking for a casual dinner, decided to hit up a favourite Thai spot of mine: Salad King. It was not too busy (but it can have a big line ups on some nights) and managed to be seated quickly. \n\nTake note: if you want back support in your chairs the common eating area's seats don't have back support and can cause discomfort or discomfort with unknown people sitting beside you. There is areas with cushions padded seats but they seems to always booked or filled up:(\n\nAnyways we sat there for 10 minutes before we got water. We actually ordered before we got water which is a restaurant faux pas in my eyes and even our waiter seemed confused that we didn't have water (but it was no biggie) as he quickly went to get it for us. \n\nOrdered off the "secret menu" which isn't really a secret it was a special that was popular and kept around even though the promo placard were taken down. The Islamic Noodles is a combination of a delicious saucy noodles with carrot slices, onions, broccoli, chicken and egg bit. \n\nThe food is the reason why I keep coming back and I do recommend this for its price, quick service and food for something causal and fun.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	bz7mlyEzV9ZJYlguaETmPg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

3OmOrgU3_UhkXUyemrqh8Q	3	2012-03-03 00:00:00	I used to eat here 5-8 times a month because its fast and tasty.  I do wish they used less oil though so if you're watching your weight, this is not ideal for you. Also do not go less than an hour before closing, ESPECIALLY on a Sunday or you will be met with terrible service and down right rude wait staff.  Even if I go 1.5 hours before closing I will face the same result almost suredly if it is a Sunday.  They will take your food before you are finished without even asking, put up chairs at tables around you, put the bill down when you are still eating and avoid eye contact to signal they want to go home. This has happened to me about 3 times a good 45 minutes before close even when there were still 20 people left in the restaurant.  I have been a server before and I would be far too embarassed to do any of these things.  Maybe the new manager will improve this.\nI have also found a shrimp in my food once, which as a vegetarian was pretty disturbing.  Instead of comping my meal I was offered a new dish but was told I would have to wait (implying by the time my dish was prepared my friend's food would be cold if they chose to wait).  In short, food is usually good, but service can at times be sloppy depending on your server.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	2mAsoUlSD4FtHV1fATTv5g	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The portion was huge and it was only $10 for what's essentially two different dishes mixed into one.

It has lots of seats (which are pretty much always full) and as far as Thai food goes, it's very cheap.\n\nSalad King is often lined up, with waits of up to 30 minutes, but people often choose to wait.  They also do take out, but I've been told that take out could take up to 30 minutes, so if you are hoping to by pass the wait by doing take out, know that it's not always a safe bet.  I would recommend that you call ahead, because it's really the best way to save yourself some grief.\n\nLots of their food is delicious, but my personal favourite is the Siam Noodle.  It comes with a peanut sauce that is a reason in itself to buy this dish.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	XDYnGRhaCQteZNFPZonRow	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The food is spot on for what you would expect.  My doors are hardly blown off, yet, my expectations are always met.  This is never a bad thing.  \n  Without adding to the echo of multiple reviews on this place, I'll simply state that it's a fun place, worth your while if you are in the hood.  The golden curry is s favorite, alongside the chicken satay and various noodle dishes.  Go.  Eat.  Enjoy.	0	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	hG2R1kAEA97Kyefydj2stA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

This dish is amazing! \n\nTheir green curry is also good and other dishes are ok.  DO NOT order salad here, I'm not sure why it has salad in the name but definitely not a good place to have a salad. This restaurant is mostly filled with university students as it has really affordable prices. It's also close to Dundas Square so it's in a great location.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	bXWZQNDHjMKjdcXgH3k70A	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I went with their cashew chicken with white rice shrug was just okay. Nothing special. \n\nHonestly this isn't my go to Thai place. I prefer Khao San Rd but for a quick Thai craving I'll stop in here. I find their prices are higher than it used to be when I used to attend Ryerson. Some lunches the service is bad. They barely notice you. Had to flag them down.

3_INc6SUMInZx0FPTU5nPg	4	2017-07-21 00:00:00	I'm so glad I finally got to try Salad King because my only knowledge of Thai food is Thai Express. \n\nWhen we arrived, we were seated right away and water was served to us immediately (much appreciated). \n\nUnfortunately they were out of the miniature shrimp rolls so I ended up opting for the spring rolls. They're alright, wouldn't recommend this though. \n\nMy partner and I got the Phud Thai, I got the medium chicken and he got 3 chilli shrimp. I can definitely say it's so much better than Thai Express as expected. I did not taste any heat in mine which I don't really mind but my partner was sweating off of 3 chilli's alone. \n\nOverall, service was great, atmosphere was great, food was great besides the spring roll.

I've tried everything on their menu - from the golden curry to the islamic noodles. I will say that they won't disappoint! If you want to go to a nice place with delicious Thai food with less than 15-20 minute wait - go to salad king!!!

Atmosphere is great and the place is clean and modern. While I miss the old location (being right across from the Ryerson Campus) where it is now located (on Yonge by the foot locker) it is still pretty easy to find. \n\nThe food is amazing -they have a really goof variety of Thai food and it's delicious, and the prices are great. \n\nSeriously love this place...the only thing that I would change is the seating. Because Salad King is so popular, its always really busy so if you don't get a  booth you will probably end up at those super long tables ( in which you are sitting on a bench like chair-no back support) or in the front. I just wished they had more space to accommodate more room for your party so you are not so close to other people/tables.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	eKD0oCdjDxwn0IN6552oyQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I do miss those days. But i can't say that I don't crave SK every so often\n\nHere's what I've learnt though in my many many visits. Their noodles are top notch but very few of the curry dishes are finger lickin' good. I dont venture out much to those. I'm a big hot food fan so the spice scale for me is the best thing anyone can ever come up with! I've hit 15 chillies and oh my.. no words. now I stick to 5 or 7 or if im feeling adventerous 10 .. depending on what I'm getting.\n\nTry their Kari noodles - my personal fav - packed with flavour! \n\nI dont care what anyone has to say - my love for Salad King is never dying *insert heart here*	4	3	4	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	9EWR2_AULBcXID8ptXX_kA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

And it's not the most authentic either. But when you're hungry and on a  budget, this is the place.\n\nI usually get some kind of curry here, but this time I thought I'd try the infamous not so secret item..Islamic noodles $11 with veggies. This dish has I think some sort of peanut based sauce and it was really delicious. And i wanna add that this dish was HUGE, you'll definitely have some leftovers. My bf didn't like it though..He had the golden curry with shrimp 10.95 and I thought for that price, they should've added more shrimp. \n\nGreat food here but I really dislike the communal seating.	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ukp5bUGNcvl2OWU5CPG7fw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

However, my curry wasn't as spicy as I remembered it to be, but maybe next time I just need to kick it up a notch in the spicy scale. The Thai Islamic Noodle was as good as I remembered it to be.\nOn the other side, the food was slow.

68zbAb84_gsS1kroF75IGQ	3	2017-05-01 00:00:00	This is the type of place that was yummy but not refined.\n\nThe chicken satay (very juicy chicken breast pieces but the satay sauce needed more peanut flavour and less peanut chunks and the chicken needed more marinate and grill flavour). The islamic noodles were sooo good on the first few bits but then it got too creamy and too rich, making it hard to finish more than half of the dish, a dash of lime would have helped immensely. The pad thai was very yummy as well but lacked on the sour note and was a bit too much on the sweet side. \n\nIn both dishes, the noodles were a tad overcooked and the choice of vegetables was a bit unauthentic (do they even have broccoli in thailand). But overall, its was good and I would come back for some cheap fusion thai food.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	swx0FJkZWb6nVP58ZsMl7w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I have an affinity towards dives normally, but I do enjoy their clean approach to cafeteria style. The neon elephant decor always makes me crack a smile, too. \n\nI usually go for the Thai hot and sour and their seafood fried rice. Both are decent. Everyone else goes nuts for their green curry, but I find it a bit sweet. \n\nPEPPER POINTS: For their easy to use chili system.

6W9zUUGfOaVpOqZD1ihwMw	2	2009-11-10 00:00:00	Wasn't what I would call a very good dining experience, to be honest.....I love spicy thai food and this was posed to be the place to get it hot, I was excited since one of my long standing complaints about thai restaurants and their unwillingness to serve me "thai hot", or fire hot food, which is well documented in my thai restaurant reviews.......the mango salad here was not great tho I will say the mangos were just right in texture and taste, otherwise it was just on top of some chopped iceburg lettuce with lime juice squirted on it..... way too tart, and  I ordered a vegetarian stir fry at a spice level of 15 out of 20, cause I can never find "thai hot" served...the server was hesitant, thinking I should start at about 7, then told me there was chili paste on the table if I wanted to spice things up...um......chili paste is not spicy compared to what thai hot should be...so finally when I explained him I didn't find sambal oelick to be hot at all, he begrudgingly took my spice level of 15 and placed the order........when the dish came out, it was veggies sauteed in a ton of sambal oelick!!!!!  No fresh chilies or anything resembling spicy anywhere...but good thing I remembered the server had told me that I had that jar of chili paste on the table to spice things up just in case there wasn't enough in the dish already.\n\nWith all the accolades posted in the window, I was excited to try this restaurant but maybe my expectations were a little too lofty, cause they certainly weren't met on this visit....I would be willing to go back to see if 20 is spicy at all and maybe try a curry, but as being I only have 4 more days here, not sure if that will happen	4	3	3	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Vparw0ZG22k1s7Xhc02nxw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

73EYE8mpoXyHx4rBpkZGfg	4	2012-01-13 00:00:00	Salad King is great! so many dishes to choose from.\n\nMy favourite is the Seafood Fried Rice, Bangkok Stir Fry & their new dish that I think that's not even on the menu yet, Khao Soi, which is basically egg noodles in curry soup. I love spicy food and I usually get 15-20 chilis. I love how they have a certain degree of hotness that you get to choose from, because for some people it's kind of hard to say how spicy you want your food. I personally love extremely spicy food, so for me it's never a problem, I just get the highest.\nI like the Panang Curry and Green Curry as well.\nNot crazy about the Pad Thai, it's a bit too sweet for my liking, but still alright. They also have Thai Islamic Noodle, which isn't on the menu, that's pretty good too.\nTheir portion is huuuuuge. It's more like 2 meals in 1 for me. I sometimes take half to go. They taste just as good microwaved the next day. \n\nFor appetizers, I like the mini-shrimp rolls, spring rolls or Mango Salad. Their Tom Yum Goong is not bad either.\n\nFor dessert, I like the Mango Sticky Rice. yumm.\n\nI've eaten at Salad King numerous times I don't even know. Ever since I was a student and until now. I was so glad when they opened their new location, because when they closed down the old location, my friends and I felt like we couldn't find other spicy-food place around that's good enough. I got so many of my friends and coworkers addicted after I brought them there. So obsessed they had to order take-out and actually have someone to cab it there to pick it up so they can eat it at work. Too bad they don't do delivery. I'd get it all the time.\n\nThe place is cafeteria style, so if there's only 2 of you, you'd most likely be seated at one of the long tables, beside strangers. If there's about 4 or more people, you might get one of the regular tables or booths.\n\nFast and great service. Washrooms pretty decent.\n\nPrice range is pretty cheap. Entrees are like $9-11, depending if you get them with Chicken, Beef or Shrimp. Shrimp being the highest.\n\nOverall, I think it's a great restaurant that will satisfy your craving for Thai food (although it's not exactly authentic).	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	wrHibYfHq_bHs4FnAZFpdg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
73trWI8fxOUBO0Cu94XYEw	4	2011-04-10 00:00:00	I met up with one of my good friends after work last night for some good food before heading to the library to finish our final papers. We walk in and I'm already impressed by the unique décor. It looks like a school cafeteria, but for cooler kids. We're seated immediately and I look down to see the chili scale on the easy-on-the-eye paper menu. Having grown up eating spicy Korean food, and taking into consideration most restaurants really mean mild when they say extra spicy, I thought I could take on the 10 chillis. So that's what I initially ordered, until our waitress gave me the "Ummm are you SURE?" look, which totally chickened me out because she was Korean as well.  So I decided to tone it down a bit, and go for the 5 chillis. My friend still seemed pretty worried for me.\n\nWhen the food came out (which was super fast considering it was really busy), the duo sitting next to us looked over at my dish before I even noticed and exclaimed "Pretty!! Rice shaped like a pyramid!" and then when one of them heard what I ordered he said "I can't WAIT to see you try and eat that". \n\n"HOLY SMOKES!!" was my reaction after my dinner at Salad King. "Omggg my brain is on fire! Do they have milk? These guys aren't kidding!" were just some of the words I uttered while bulldozing through my meal.  My friend got the Thai Fried Rice and I had the Panang Curry...................... with 5 chillis. Needless to say, the dish punished me pretty bad, I had a stomach ache after. But did I wake up craving it the next morning? HECK YEAH! \n\nI think the duo next to us got a real kick out of seeing me suffer through the meal. Again, our waitress was great because she kept coming over to fill my glass and ask me if I was okay haha. The food was pretty good but when something is that spicy, you don't really taste much after the first 2 bites. I decided I wanted to be a soldier and I finished everything, even had spoonfuls of the curry itself. I didn't even want to think while I was eating it because it was so spicy. But all in all, it was a lot of fun eating it and I was very full! By the time we got to the library I was k.o-ed and fell asleep for an hour hehe.\n\nWARNING: These guys are SERIOUS about their spicy-scale! Don't even attempt anything over 3 chillis if you haven't been trained to handle heat!! I think I could get used to the 5-chillis, but the 20 chilis would most likely have me landing in the hospital. No joke. Dear Salad King, in terms of spicy level, hands down, "respect".	0	2	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	UzhbEOOqmbINTJo6K9PH_Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

794SCylY1qwTUogw3WQryA	4	2016-02-09 00:00:00	I have some pretty fond memories of this place, as it was our go-to during my years as an undergrad student in the area. While the food can be on and off (i.e. don't get the veggie spring rolls, unless you like the bland defrosted kind), it's been mostly "on" for me, and it's a great, reliable spot just a couple of minutes away from the Eaton Centre, at a really decent price point!\n\nI've had the golden curry, the green curry, the tom yum soup, a couple of the stir fries, and the Islamic noodles. If you're looking for a curry, go for the golden curry - nice and sweet with a great kick to it. The green curry can be a hit or miss, and can be a bit watery at times, but otherwise, it's decent. The Islamic noodles, as others have mentioned, is fantastic and has more flavour than you can describe. It might not look like much on your plate, but once you have it, the sauce and noodles together are a perfectly complicated combination of flavours that you can't stop eating. \n\nIf you're looking for reliable, no-nonsense, reasonably priced Thai food, particularly if you're at the Yonge/Dundas area, this is a decent spot. It's also great for families and big groups. Note, however, that street parking is very, very limited.	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	C7lXOTSLUAHG3gkG_Q_39w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

7DGfNkas_FOD8dgghdrWBA	4	2017-03-08 00:00:00	I've visited Salad King on multiple occasions over the years and always found the food enjoyable. It is by no means the most authentic Thai restaurant but it doesn't advertise itself as such and it's delicious none the less. I like to think of this as a "starter" restaurant for those who don't normally eat Thai food or those who want a quicker, cheaper alternative to the more popular Thai restaurants in the city. \n\nMy most recent orders have been: \n- Siam noodles (with beef): best option for those who love peanuts\n- Islamic noodles (with chicken): not listed on the menu but is definitely a must try. Best way for me to describe this is a penang curry noodle dish...less curry than khao soi but more sauce and sweeter than your typical pad thai. \n- Thai fried rice: I found this a little on the dry side but very flavourful and aromatic. This paired perfectly with the Islamic noodles. \n\nRestaurant gets pretty load and packed during peak dining hours and the set-up is mainly communal tables. This means you should be prepared to sit next to strangers. Difficult to have a private conversation but at least they have quick table turnovers so can't complain about that!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	uqP9qCcV1Wi4B1qnj1N90Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

That was before a whole wave of trendy Thai restaurants started opening downtown.\n\nSalad King's food tastes very salty and somewhat greasy. I'm constantly thirsty when I eat here, so a part of me suspects that there is MSG in the food. I used to order the Hot Thai noodles each time, but that hasn't been consistent in the last few years.\n\nI don't really enjoy the cafeteria-style seating, particularly because it's stainless steal. The place is always crowded with students and the food just isn't worth the wait.\n\nI think it's a very good place for university students to go to, but since I'm not in that stage of my life anymore, I think I'd go elsewhere for a better meal.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	8P2LkzPGV4ID_fE7gJGKGg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

7pSlVNGDhI5ti1bwgOd8CQ	3	2016-06-01 00:00:00	I've visited Salad King a few times in the past and went back last night because I was craving the Islamic noodles. We dropped by around 4:30 on a weekday and it was fairly empty which is nice because you're not forced to sit beside strangers in tight quarters. We both ordered Islamic noodles with 10 chilies and were served fairly quickly. For the price, the food portions are quite large and arrived hot to the table. \n\nBased on my experience, I believe the chilly system is flawed because different menu items are affected differently by the chilies. For example, the first time I went to Salad King, I ordered the Islamic noodles with 10 chilies. It was spicy but I enjoyed it. Another time I ordered the Golden Curry with 10 chilies because I knew I could handle it based on the Islamic noodles. Unfortunately, the curry was waay too spicy and I regretted my decision instantly. Not sure if this was just a coincidental thing or if the inconsistency is normal but it made me a little more risk-averse when it comes to ordering. \n\nOverall, a great place for groups and quick meals	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ldS3GeShxTm4Kk2WS3jnHQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

7wY7y3Y-5vsIyfbJWyZP2A	3	2014-09-30 00:00:00	Salad King is what I would consider to be cheap and cheerful Thai - if your idea of cheap and cheerful involves a noisy packed room of people waiting for tasty (if not authentic) food. \n\nService is very quick and you're never waiting long for food. I would say the food is consistently good (although the spiciness varies, despite ordering the same number of 'chili peppers' each time I'm there). Favourites include the spring rolls, wonton soup, basil beef, phad thai, and green curry.\n\nYes, I understand that there are way more authentic Thai restaurants in the city. But if you're looking for a fairly inexpensive meal close to downtown where service is prompt and the food is pretty good, Salad King is a good choice.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	sXkL3Hb3SZf5MTjN0qLDyw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The new location is across the road and north of the old location.\n\nI used to go to that old location, and missed it during the hiatus following the partial building collapse.\n\nThe food is always pretty good, the prices are reasonable, and the portions are large.  I love the Siam noodles and the Golden/Yellow Curry is great too.  There just aren't enough Thai places in Toronto where you can buy Golden Curry.\n\nA few cons for an otherwise great place:\n- The young ladies who assign tables and call out names can seem clueless at times.  On one occasion, they insisted that we put our name on the list, although there was a table ready.  They turned around momentarily, and called our name 10 seconds later.  Even though we didn't move in that time, they looked over the crowd behind uswhile calling our name - they obviously had forgotten who we were in the 10 seconds since they greeted us.\n\n- The spice level is inconsistent.  Tonight we had 3 dishes.  One with no chillies, one with 3 chillies, and one with 10 chillies.  The 3 chilly pepper dish was actually hotter than the 10 chilly pepper dish.\n\n- Yes, it's very loud - and crowded.  It comes with the popularity.	2	1	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	qp0Ne8Ndhucz7s46GLO0og	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

My family got and finished their meal and a good 10 minutes goes by before the waitress came by with my food. By that time I was too mad to even eat, so I return the plate, paid and left. Bad service, no food. Completely ruined my night. Thanks!	0	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	1hXO0VPWJIbsPmazODXriQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

SK has really moved up since the fire of years yonder. \n\nFor a casual dining option, the interiors are impressive. Bright and bold murals of cheeky sayings and colourful floral lamps that look modern really add a punch. \n\nBut that said, Salad King still maintains its atmosphere of glorified cafeteria. Communal seating lends to many opportunities to eavesdrop on conversations. Also new are booths. There are plenty on the side. \n\nService is friendly and quick as well. That said, Foursquare and Yelp were very useful in helping me choose a menu item. I don't think the staff would have revealed the secret menu item otherwise. \n\nTHE FOOD \nI ordered a chicken satay. Four skewers with a generous helping of peanut sauce was very reasonable at $5. I wouldn't get it again though because even though it was real chicken, it didn't really taste like it and it was charred. \n\nThe real surprise here was the Islamic Noodles - not on the menu. \nIT's pad thai noodles with their Panang Curry - Sweet Asian basil, peanut, lime leaf, bell pepper, Panang curry with coconut milk, served with steam rice.\nAll I have to say is GAT DAMN! Now it doesn't come close to Khao San Road's Sam Roas (which in my mind is the best pad thai I've ever had) but this one is full of flavour and the portions are PLENTIFUL! Plus, you'll get a nice chunk of broccoli in there so you can count your five a day. \n\nI got the chicken and shrimp and there were three pieces of shrimp in my bowl. I probably will just stick with chicken next time.\n\nI like that they give you a pot of green tea as well. \n\nNote: their phud thai is not great as I've experienced in past visits. \n\nTotal cost for an app, large sized main and green tea = $20\n\nOBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK \nIn terms of bang for buck, Salad King remains king of the castle. And atmosphere and space wise, this is a MAJOR step up from the old location. Kudos!	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	WHmabbfgdSW-JrOU9ePMrA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

My go tos are hot Thai noodles, green curry chicken, hot and sour mushroom soup, mango salad, spring rolls but everything I've tried I liked.

This isn't authentic Thai but it will satisfy your craving without leaving a giant hole in your wallet.\n\nThe Phad Thai is delicious. The curries are tasty. The crispy spring rolls are perfect for sharing. \n\nJust don't order the mango salad when mangoes aren't in season.\n\nService here is consistent and staff seem knowledgeable about the spice levels of the dishes. Price isn't that much more than the fast food versions of westernised Thai and is so much tastier (plus quality of ingredients show).\n\nCome here instead.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	XzZ2ftLgS7ArQX8vH6-qUw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Menu selection is pretty good and the food is good.  Its not some delicacy that will leave you craving more (that and the portions are generally fairly large so good luck even finishing your dish), but it hits the spot, is easy on your pocket book, and is kind of fun.

9NxPd7b0dwNPv96APdErDg	4	2014-01-13 00:00:00	If you're looking for some good, potentially greasy Thai food, Salad King is the way to go.\n\nLocated conveniently between College and Dundas (on Yonge), it's the perfect place to grab some grub before an exam, or after a long day of work. \n\nI had the Kari noodles at a level of 3 chilis. The restaurant allows you to choose how spicy you want your dish, ranging from "medium" to "20 chilis". If you value your life, I would not go to 20 chilis, as 3 left my sniffing and sweating like a crazy person.\n\nThe noodles were really great. Full of flavour and piled with vegetables and meat instead of loading up the dish with mainly noodles. \n\nI enjoyed the atmosphere as well. It's casual but clean, and sits on the second floor of the building so you feel a bit separated from the street below, making it a true escape.\n\nSuper affordable (with no drink, approximately $10 for dinner) and great food, a definite staple for students and young working folk alike.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	wu-ijx0ZiBThoc9tRHf_Hw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
9P2DZ2I88xzTtgAoBvgTLg	5	2012-12-30 00:00:00	I've been here twice and both times it has been a streamlined, friendly, and amazing experience... despite the communal tables. I don't know if it's how the place is designed but you don't really hear what neighbours are talking about unless you really eavesdrop, and the noise in the place doesn't overpower conversation so that's pretty cool.\n\nThe food is great, it's a really good quick in and out place. It's how fast food should be done, even though it's delicious and not really 'fast food'. I got the satay chicken skewers and orange chicken without rice, because I am a protein craving beast. What was really cool is if you say 'no rice' they take a dollar off the bill. So it's super neat that they award you for not wasting food and that they have that option on their bill till. It's a busy place so the staff is quick, friendly and don't really have time for chit chat, but it's cool that they have a smile on their face (and are cute :P).	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	15H7TA0QXggx7UgVJrU8Dg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I find if you want cheap and good food this is the place to go.  I have brought people from out of town at this place and they are love it. \n\nThe only complaint I have is there spice-level. It seems to vary from time to time I go there and I always order a 3. The heat can reach up to a 5 at times (I know this because I used to order a 5) whenever I order a 3 and it just ruins the experience.  \n\nI usually order Golden Chicken curry and its damn good. Other Thai places doesn't do justice to this place especially for prices and portion. \n\nIt does get insanely busy and the service isn't consistent. That still doesn't deter me from going here.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	_cSPKhqUVAEeeyMfrjdgJg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
A1zhdEQE4C0PbTccFfux4Q	4	2015-05-10 00:00:00	A humorously named Thai restaurant, located near Dundas and Yonge. \n\nI came here as a party of two around 8 o clock and were seated in a large open concept restaurant environment. It resembles a beer hall and you will sit fairly closely with other people, so if you do not enjoy that, you may want to give Salad King a pass.\n\nWhat this does however, is amplify your senses with the roar of conversation happening around you. This place is alive. This place is happening. It just is. \n\nI ordered the Khao Soi, and my friend ordered the Thai Islamic Noodles with shrimp (off menu according to fellow yelpers! I'm late to the party and am not a native of Toronto so don't hurt attack me if this is a well known fact). Additionally, you can order with a custom spicy level by the number of "Chillies". We ordered our dishes with 4 chillies. \n\nThe food came with a generous portion and within 10-15 minutes. While 3 chillies was too mild for my taste, the food was extremely flavourful. The Thai Islamic noodles were a nice blend of sweet and savoury, more so on the savoury side. The dish is composed of rice noodles soaked in a tasty coconut curry.  \n\nThe Khao Soi was a coconut soup with egg noodles, cruchy breading and chicken breast. Equally tasty to the Thai Islamic Noodles.\n\nHighly recommended to visit this place for some good food.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Ux1as9FUJM4yHdBkNjVxiA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I tried something new this time around with Vermicelli and was not disappointed. Anything with coconut curry added with some shrimp is always a popular one. And round of your meal with their mango rice dessert and your stomach will be satisfied. \n\nHonestly how can you go wrong when the food is great, service is better, and the most expensive thing on the menu is $10.50?	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	aaclKCiSxf05hFiWoozAlQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

When I heard the name I thought it was a vegan place and it would only serve salad- little did I know it was a Thai restaurant. Warning the spices are real. I love my spice and 4 chillies hit the spot. \n\nPortions were decent size and if you really wanted share it would be enough. The Phad Thai was delicious and the spices were true to the spice scale! I was amaze because most of the time the spice scale doesn't do justice... One of the special dishes that's not on the menu is Islamic noodles. Über delicious- you can taste the coconut flavour and it is heaven. Truly heaven. \n\nThe service was really good. Our servicer frequently came back to check on us. On a side note; the aura of the place is great. Love the colours and the setting of the restaurant. Glad I visited, the only reason it got a 4 out of 5 because I wasn't really blown out of the water. The food was definitely great but it's not superb fantastically amazing. Don't get me wrong it is a place I would totally recommend to others for sure- just not a 5.\n\nVerdict: GO now!	1	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	xEajChTkzWIYTMLkYNoIIw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

If you're picky, can't wait, and you need a more comfortable atmosphere, you really want to avoid this place.  Luckily, I'm a student, and I don't care about how loud it gets or waiting in line.  \n\nThe food is great for the price you pay.  Some people are saying they hated the food (it was too sweet, sour, whatever) but I think it's just a personal preference thing.  South-east Asians use a lot of sweet/sour+salty combinations in their food, so as a South-east Asian, I have no complaints.  Don't come here if you're not sure if you like that.\n\nI've been here about 3 or 4 times and the only problem I've had was with the atmosphere.  If you just want a cheap meal and don't mind the wait and noise, don't miss this place.  4/5 stars.	2	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Kjh1SBVHyjM-CzN_A5c6kQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

This past Saturday the rice was unspeakably bad. How can a Thai restaurant not know how to steam a pot of rice?? I can't look past that, regardless of the rest of my meal. \n\nI've got other Thai options up my sleeve for future cravings now (Golden Thai, Sukho Thai, etc.). \n\nAlso, still unacceptably closed on Sundays and only open till 9pm other nights.	6	2	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	JnPIjvC0cmooNDfsa9BmXg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

My go-to is the secret menu item: the Islamic Noodle (Chicken) with 3 chilis.

It was ok.\n\nWhat go me going was the islamic noodle with 10 chilli - a superb noodle dish.  It is a pad thai drenched in spicy cocconut sauce with lots of subtle ingredients.  It is food that looks so so (grey overall color) but becomes an art in your mouth and punches you out while it goes down your throat - and you want more.  And it is not even in the menu - why!  Holy name should be associated with holy food.\n\nI took a star off because of the uncomfortable seating and loud noise.

aaiX52cur3S3INaOy5VmfA	4	2015-03-17 00:00:00	Came in late one evening to have dinner. The food is excellent as always. I used to go often during the spring/ summer time. The last time I've been there was last year May. I've noticed some changes.\nOne primarily is the pricing of the food. Many years ago before they moved a main entree was about $6.00 - $7.00 (non seafood that is). Now prices are average about $9.00 +. Servings are still very generous. We had shrimp phud Thai, shrimp parang curry and spring rolls. All very delicious. Must have with peanut sauce!!!!  One comment I have is about the service. It wasn't only myself but the other customers sitting on the same row as us. We all received our waters, no name of who will be serving us. Literally waited fifteen minutes before someone takes our order. It's quite obvious if people are looking around for someone to attend to them. Couldn't irk me enough that even "J's" (who was our server ) colleagues who can see that we were upset with the lack of service didn't even attend to us or at least acknowledge that we were ready to order and "let her know we were ready".  It's team work. If one person is not picking up the slack, help out. Makes the atmosphere look really bad--- let alone the restaurant. No excuses if it's the beginning or end of the shift- tired or not.... Get it together and pay attention. She didn't even check in on us after we got our food. I even had to turn around and look at her when our waters were empty... If the service is like this what would make me want to go again? Don't let this be your reputation salad king!!!  Your food is amazing!!! I would definitely go again! BUT if you had someone who came there for the first time - I would say that was an overall bad experience. One last suggestion. Find an area or a rack where people can put their coats/ jackets. Especially during winter! The under the chair/ bench thing won't cut it... Area is too small and don't want to be disturbing people... Also have more high chairs/ booster seats for infants/ babies. Prior my last visit, I had a two year old with me! Was that ever the worst experience. We had to keep him in his stroller coz they had no high chairs! I even saw a couple as well who had the same experience.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	sbO9zVI2iKwJjEphuwD2-g	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

They have their menu on their website, but a meal ranges 7-10 dollars, more if you do dessert and appetizers of course.\n\nTheir Golden curry is delicious, and their Pad Thai is very legitimate.

Aq6yX0CCKKda6uWQwGhqFA	5	2015-02-04 00:00:00	I live in Calgary BUT every time I come to Toronto, Salad King is on the menu! Great prices first of all. I know some people have had issues finding tables but I've never had to wait longer than ~10-15 minutes for a table. The Panang Red Curry is especially good. The Pataya Chicken and Kari noodles are a big hit too. Food is always quick and staff always polite and filling up the water cups on time. I've never gone higher than 5 chilis on their spice chart (that was plenty for me!) but friends have tried up to 15. Don't take those warnings lightly, it can get spicy.\n\nSo if you're around Yonge/Eaton Center and looking for some good, quick, well priced food, Salad King is the go to place!	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	d_SJYpIBWH3fRTL7eObZCw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

In short, because I haven't been there since last summer (but went several times over the course of it) the food is lovely and I used to always get the Non-spicey pad Thai (noodles are out of this world) .. Dish is so flavourful! \nAnother thing I really appreciate (as I can't tolerate spice at allllll, hate it) is the fact they have the proper symbol beside the spicey dishes! \n\n\nHave literally no complaints about this place	0	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	985NGk0Mv-i10F1dLn1uDw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
AT8SgIcMeZoAjcB-3HvlQQ	2	2014-12-02 00:00:00	Nothing great to say about this place.\n\nWay too bright, way too loud. Food is meh. Nothing worth mentioning. The communal seating is annoying if anything. The servers seem to constantly be harassed, which is likely a sign there needs to be more staff.\n\nThe rice was overdone, as was the chicken. The sauce was oily and not appealing, I had the golden/yellow/whatever curry chicken. Chicken was not tasty, but tough.\n\nMy friends seemed satisfied with their meals, but I think most people want a little more than satisfaction. There are many, MANY, better thai restaurants in Toronto. This was on par with the thai food my university used to serve in the residence hall.\n\nThe only reason I don't give it one star is that I've heard good things about this place, so someone must like it.	2	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	uVEoZmmL9yK0NMgadLL0CQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I highly doubt this is anything close to authentic but hey if you are hungry and you don't want to break your bank then this is the place for you. I tried green curry which has not much to write about but, gotta say the secret menu item was indeed very good! I forgot the name of the dish now, oh wait it wasn't on the menu either. The portion is very generous and unless you are a real hungry beast you can get the leftover packed to go for lunch the day after.	3	2	3	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	F8ctt9HK2uCt8UBbUSHFRg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I was quite disappointed by their khao soi though. I would go to Pai or Sukhothai or Khao San Road if you're looking for good khao soi.\n\nIf you are looking for a dessert that's not too sweet, give their mango sticky rice try. Salad King serves a decent sized portion compared to a lot of places.\n\nOverall Salad King has great quality food and big portions for the amount that you pay. There is also lots of seating so even if there's a line, it moves quickly. The only complaint I have is that it's quite noisy so I wouldn't recommend if you want to have a conversation during your meal.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	_6CTDWsw4Fdr6R9ZzKvLZQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
B2o3vEfiStChAYSRGzDP3A	2	2015-10-09 00:00:00	I went to Salad King a lot because a friend of mine from Kingston likes this place. But they have been going downhill lately and I am boycotting them at the moment because of a few incidents. During my last visit, I ordered Siam Fried Rice (my favourite fried rice on the menu) with 1 chilli. My sister ordered the same dish with 3 chillis. But guess what? Mine was spicer than hers, it felt like 5 chillis. I tried eating it despite being spicy but i couldn't take it after maybe 5 bites. I told the waitress and asked if it's okay if they fixed it -  she said yes so she sent the dish back and when it came back, it was the same dish, except it was warmer! I was so mad i had to force myself to eat half of it because I was hungry! You don't mess with a hungry me! NO!\n\nAlso, I remember this one time I ordered Basil Chicken and guess what? There were barely any basil in my dish! My friend ordered another dish that has basil in it and she had more basil than mine! So why is it called BASIL Chicken then?\n\nSalad King is very inconsistent with its cooking and that is one thing I HATE. \n\nI wanted to give them 1 star but because they are okay sometimes, I have to be fair.	2	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	k34ZlKQwy_ybVlYzeoBlbA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
b2OgtQCVyE8xzBhesIoFKw	2	2011-03-10 00:00:00	After spending $30ish for two people ... we both left hungry?!  :(\n\nMy husband, little guy, and I all decided to go to the Salad King on a weeknight when I didn't feel like cooking.  I had been dying to try this place out based on all the positive reviews. \n\nWe ordered a lemon grass soup, thai basil noodles (YUM), and siam fried rice.  The food itself was decent ... although it sort of tasted a little westernized.  My husband enjoyed the fried rice while I preferred the noodles - loved the texture  ... yum!  The soup was average.\n\nThe service was extremely friendly.  Everyone was so accomodating and friendly to our little guy.  The hostess gave him a little sticker which he found to be delicious.\n\nThe restaurant is on the second floor but it is handicap accessible - there is an elevator.\n\nThe decor is very modern and cool.  The place was bustling for a Monday night.  Lots of young university students ... which is why I was surprised that both my husband and I left feeling hungry?!  Aren't university students usually starving and strapped for cash?	4	2	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Rg-86Gr5Oe8ODoMUfr1M1Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I order all my dishes 20 chilli here and it's amazing. \n\nDon't be scared though if crazy hot is not your thing. They have great food for everyone at all spice levels. \n\nMy all time faves: Thai fried rice, Thai basil noodles, golden curry chicken, Sea Queen (squid/calamari)\n\nI loaded some pics of my faves that I had today!

BiUWrNzskYPnf2enU7zsSw	3	2013-05-08 00:00:00	Spicy Fish $10 - I guess I was expecting a dry fish dish and was disappointed with this one.  The fish were breaded and deep fried, but was soaking in sauce so the fillet were soggy.  I wasn't a fan of the shredded carrots and the bell peppers in this dish.  This dish comes spicy (which cannot be made unspicy), but the spice level was good.  The rice was good and the portion was generous.\n\nMy coworker had the Thai fried rice and decided to go with spice level of 10 (on a scale of 20) and couldn't eat his meal.  The waiter did try to warn him that it was too high.  I tried a bit and it was pretty spicy.\n\nI didn't see Thai Iced Tea or Coffee on the menu, which I like to order when I'm having Thai food.  We asked the waiter about it and we were in luck!  They JUST got Thai Iced Tea and it was good, not too sweet for $2.75.\n\nThe decor is nice and colorful and they have window seats available.  The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor.\n\nService was friendly but slow during lunch hour.	4	3	3	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	1pzP58PeWictHQzctMU0nQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

BP9IGo4AcU2bnvRAo_DZ6Q	1	2013-02-02 00:00:00	The "rainbow chicken" was disgusting, bland and was watery. The dish was like a game of "Where's Waldo?" except you're trying to find chicken among soggy, tasteless vegetables. \nThe "mango chicken" tasted funny and was watery. It looked identical to the rainbow chicken except the sauce had been swapped out for an orange one. \nYes, the food is somewhat moderately priced, but 9 bucks for some watery crap? No thanks. There are so many better Thai places in Toronto.\nThe noise level is crazy in here and the fact you're sitting in such close proximity to (possibly questionable) diners makes me cringe. On this night, my dining companion and I were seated squished against a wall next to a couple on their date. But the story doesn't end there, at one point, they began hand-feeding each other dessert and I tried really hard not to vomit. The man also had a fixation with my phone because I caught him staring at the screen multiple times whenever I was using it. Service was non-existent and we left half our food on the plate, got the bill and rushed out of there feeling somewhat violated. Such an overrated restaurant. \n\nMcDonalds or SK?

BRqBXy1cjOMuLwqv-MNmMQ	4	2015-05-11 00:00:00	Believe the hype. In the heart of Toronto, the King has risen.\n\nThe King generously provides some of the finest Thai dishes straight from Thailand heavens. He is the one past customers would drool over; newcomers would eat their hearts out for; and even leave other Thai restaurants begging for mercy. A legend in the making, the King brings great admiration but can still seek for pefection.\n\nThe King shows great empathy to commoners living in today's economy, offering affordably priced meals in a generous size.\n\nThe King encourages togetherness. My party of four was seated at a teenie tiny square table (sized for a party no more than 3, but perfect for 2). Our large menu sheets overlapped one another; footsies was unavoidable; purses tightly pressed against our bodies. Yet the King refused to offer us the neighbouring table... the empty table was waiting for a party of at least 6. Only until we asked again and again were we finally endowed a larger table.\n\nThe King seems oblivious that back pain is prevalent in today's society. If you do not merit recognition to be seated on the cushioned seats, most seats do not have a backing. Your back and posture will have to fend for itself.\n\nI had the Panang Curry with Beef. The Panang curry was a flavourful perfect blend of spices and vegetables, with a liberal amount of beef, and rich coconut taste. The amount of curry was too much in comparison to the amount of rice given. But not to worry, the curry will not be wasted. It is so delicious you will clean that bowl dry.\n\nThere is no denying that Salad King is Royal. As long as Salad King is around, no stomach in this great land of ours will be a stranger to Thai food. \n\nLong live the Salad King.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	HLq-6H8YG9Zyk5jphv0cxw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

BTzIDYYsnYEhkRwAxMlSWg	5	2015-03-18 00:00:00	Dropped by with my coworkers for a quick lunch. It was the St.Pattys Day Parade that day so it was a bit busy. When we walked in the waitress was friendly and we requested if we can sit near the window. Having a table of 5, I was worried they wouldn't have a table. And viola! There was a table. I've actually sat at that exact table before. It's a bit odd cause it's in the corner and a bit tough to get in. But when we ordered we presented the City Of Toronto coupons for free spring rolls. Instantly water was brought to our table. We ordered and our waiter was pretty awesome. But he forgot the spring rolls. It's okay though. Then there was a scene with an old man wanting to watch the parade near the window but there was no table open. So he forced his way into a seat. The waitress apologized to us and the manager took care of it well. So back to the food. Great food. Great price. But we reminded our waiter about the spring rolls and within a minute he got them. Even though it was given at the end of our meal... it turned into a dessert. Haha. Great place!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Bd9E80-OMZdiTTBh1sduFA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

buNDA7HERsolQ3xhd3fe_g	3	2009-10-06 00:00:00	So my fiancee loves Salad King. She says that the Curry served here is the best in the city. I also enjoy a good Thai resturant and not being from around here I am always eager to eat someplace that is held in high regards by her.  With that being said, we gave this place 2 go's on my previous visits and each time I found that the food I got was good, but by no means fantastic by my palate.  The first go I ordered the Mango Chicken dish. When arrived the presentation was excellent but flavor was lackluster. It seemed to have something missing and was rather bland. Second go I got the orange chicken which had a lot more flavor this time, however a few pieces of my chicken came out cold. \n\nIt's in a good location and is constantly busy whenever we go by it. When we get the urge for Thai we'll continue coming here, it just has room for little improvements here and there.	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ev_mrEIDJauxugj1r8Z3qg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
buy4Hk91iGP2iFnELeLU9w	2	2017-01-21 00:00:00	I've been coming here since just after the original location burned down. The food is always consistent. It's good. \n\nThe one major problem I have with the place lately is that no matter how often you come, no matter how well you tip, you're never remembered. Believe me, I'm a regular and coming here is part of our routine. The staff here doesn't change THAT much but it does. \n\nThat being said we've been greeted by the same of two hostesses for the past year and a half and we may as well be meeting them for the first time every time. \n\nOur preferences are not unreasonable and we never ask for something they cannot do. But some care into recognizing regular beyond a tacky "chili club card" would be great. I've met street vendors who serve way more customers who still treat regulars with respect and recognition. \n\nThe Saturday evening hostess now gives you attitude and it's most unpleasant. \n\nI know that's it a a popular Ryerson student spot and a few of the staff are students too, but students are paying customers too, just as much as they are people. I'm not a student but I see how people are treated now. It sucks. \n\nIn the 6 years I've been coming here regularly, I've noticed that the quality of service has suffered. \n\nEven as I type this I noticed 3 servers see a napkin fall on the ground by the bar area, look at it or kick it, but not actually pick it up and discard it. \n\nI would give the Salad King 4 stars or higher like I used to but I can't when things I've fallen this far. \n\nIt doesn't take much effort to make a customer happy. Failing to do so, even with minimal effort, is a failure on the entire establishment. \n\nImprove please.	2	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	pk5QdLFK6Mk14g_EYBkfLg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
BwPhgdnO9sGMHp-DiRYZhQ	3	2016-06-05 00:00:00	I like Salad King as a staple fast food before the movies.   I had the mango salad and the pad thai.   The pad thai was good as usual but the mango salad was not worth ordering again.  I would still use it as a fast food staple before the movies.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	iSkYlSJRz4CDNGapjXOnNg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
BYsq0tYNmM9IG871bfRPQw	5	2013-12-10 00:00:00	I've probably passed by this place a hundred times thinking it's a vegetarian place. Major thanks to my friend who told me this is a Thai restaurant. Since I was introduced to this place, I've revisited again 2 more times. It's now firmly in my heart as my default Thai place.\n\nIt's hard for a restaurant to get more popular than this. Even on a weekday night, the restaurant seems almost full. They must be doing something right. After visiting, I think so too. They do take out which might be tempting when they are full. Just remember to get water from somewhere if you can't take spicy food well.\n\nIf you do sit down, remember that this isn't really a place for a quiet upscale dinner. The main area is like a school cafeteria. During busy hours, you are almost guaranteed to be sitting next to a stranger, similar to Wrvst. They do have some "normal" seating but they are for larger groups. \n\nPros:\n-Decent value. Around $9 per dish pre-tax. At this price level, you can forget Thai Express! \n-Decent portion! Especially when you consider the price. \n-Fast service. They clearly can consistently manage even full capacity.\n-A rewards card. Buy 10 meals and get 1 free!\n-Food tastes awesome! Authentic? Maybe I've never been to Thailand but Salad King is good for me! Some Thai places I've tried tasted like Chinese stir fry! \n-Can choose level of spiciness. \n\nCons:\n-I can't think of anything else. I wished they have another location closer to me.\n\nAll pros and no cons? 5 Stars!	2	0	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	xVV86BToDOQGxE1gt9MMvg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
c-vMXvytRxAyvOnSfXbvlQ	4	2016-02-15 00:00:00	I came here with my friends and ordered the yellow curry and it was SOOO good. It had a really rich flavour and went really well with the rice. One of my friends had the islamic noodles which is basically chicken pad thai with coconut curry (it's not on the menu so you have to ask for it) and it was also AMAZING. I strongly recommend either one of those dishes. Yellow curry if you want something small, islamic noodles if you want a big portion. \n\nWe also shared chicken and beef skewers but in my opinion the chicken skewers were better. They make a great appetizer and we were literally fighting over them because they were too good. My only complaint about this place was that the service was really slow and we were waiting a really long time just to get our appetizers.\n\nAlso if you want to try this place, go there and sit in. If you order takeout it's still okay but doesn't taste nearly as good as having it fresh.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	i-PZwf519Vu4ybNt9D8oEA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

c1u7s2DkL-XeENcQW87NWA	2	2014-06-10 00:00:00	Not impressed. \n\nShowed up a little before they opened (10 minutes) and were shown into a waiting area. Dining room was ready to go, they could have sat us and taken our drink orders. \n\nServer was friendly enough but awkward somehow. I asked for a mango smoothie with a double shot of vodka in it and her response was "We don't do doubles..." along a judgmental face that I wanted an alcoholic beverage with my lunch. I made a remark to my co-diner about how I didn't understand that they didn't "do doubles" as you can just punch in the sale of two vodka shots in the POS... She overheard, came back and said they could do it. \n\nOnce I got my drink, it was fine. \n\nOrdered mango chicken. Came in a decently large portion with a side of rice but left much to be desired... The chicken was those little giblet pieces, not appetizing... I'd rather pay more for real chicken. Rice was undercooked. Vegetables were soft. End up mushing everything around in the mango sauce and shoving it down my gullet and washing it down with my drink. \n\nAs a side note - slightly odd for a place called 'Salad King' to only have 2-3 choices for salads...	1	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	5bSjgj1d0_35ZK76JQ4tOA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
C4gewBEJDsMXeAZm9HW1qg	4	2014-01-08 00:00:00	How do you review a Thai cafeteria? I joke, but the dining here is quite a unique experience. \n\nI was finally brought here after months of being told of its glory and tastiness. Too bad I wasn't warned about the set up. If you're up for an evening of yelling at your friends and hearing the discussion next to you, then this is the atmosphere for you. (I admit, I prefer quieter settings). Surprisingly, service is actually ok considering it's essentially a cluster of people crammed in together.\n\nI ordered the Pad Thai and boy was it ever good! Authentic? Not so much. But tasty! And the portion size would explain why just about half of Ryerson university is chilling there. You are practically guaranteed leftovers at a very reasonable price! \n\nIt's hard for me to give a star rating for a place like this because it is so out of the ordinary (and out of my comfort zone in terms of dining). But for what it delivers and promises, it's certainly worth 4 stars.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	USn-E16UUM45nmOp0rWEfg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
C8eWZPGs2rMqwVmr2sNA4A	2	2008-08-24 00:00:00	I am all about giving restaurants a chance, but having eaten there three times, I feel that I have enough cred to challenge the masses and inquire why the heck everyone raves about this place. \n\nI don't want to be a whiner. Really, I don't. But the appeal here seems to be its price, and being in a location that is the antithesis of a culinary wonderland helps raise its estimation in most locals' eyes. Yes, yes, yes, they have an extensive chili rating system, but gad, if this is your biggest concern, bring a bottle of hot sauce with you. I love my food spicy, but heat don't necessarily add flavour.\n\nMy biggest complaint is the sauces. I'm all about sauces. Mamma likes her sauces. But for many of the stir-fried dishes here, the sauce is less gravy than it is soup-like. Correction. "Watery-like" would probably be a more apt definition. \n\nIt's a cheap place to eat -- I'll give it that much. And it's not horrible. The cold mango rolls are a delight, in fact. But the rest of the dishes and salads seem like they're slapped together thoughtlessly. I feel like they're riding on their laurels and location. Just because they're better than the food court at Pitman Residence doesn't mean they're the most fabulous Thai restaurant in the city. Try Thai Basil or Golden Thai if you want something a lil' more flavourful.	1	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	5U1DU7CVO7qOjimpAJm2ag	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

cdAu8IPASrSfUfy1oDg1Tg	3	2017-02-19 00:00:00	If you want cheap Thai food this is the place to go! This place is always packed and there's always a line. But the wait isn't too long. People come and go really quick. \nIf you don't have much time it's a good place for take out too.  \n\nCame here a couple of times already and decided to write a review. Most of the time I ordered the curry. The curry here is delicious but the rice that comes with it isn't too good.  Portions for the curry is a little small. Needs more rice. \n\nThe fried rice dishes here are also pretty good. \n\nThe tom yum soup here is cheap but is lacking flavour. It really sour and spicy. Wouldn't recommend it. \n\nI've also ordered the Thai street noodles. The portions are huge. There's a lot of rice noodles. But the broth lacked flavour even though it's cooked with shrimp and chicken. It was just too sour. It's so sour that the noodles taste sour. It's not salty enough. The only thing you can taste is sour and spicy. Really would not recommend. They need to make major improvements to the recipe of this. \n\nAdditionally, there's a problem. The water here is tap water like most places but it has a really weird odour. You should ordered a drink instead..... \n\nThe Thai ice tea is good. \n\nOverall, good for the curries !	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	hFvLG_m26hYMx1UGQSpaEg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
CdFe8hTnAPILROWL6CoXGA	4	2009-06-08 00:00:00	Many a time I've heard these famous last words from my boyfriend: "Here, try this, it's not that hot" and the next thing I know I'm waking up on the floor in front of the refrigerator, soaked from having poured milk all over my face and mouth to try and quell the burn. \n\nOkay, so that's a bit of an exaggeration, but let's just say I have something of an extremely temperature sensitive tongue. So I was terrified when we walked into Salad King and all the servers were wearing T-shirts proclaiming "HOT!!!" and the whole place was done up with suns and fire symbols. Still, I decided to be a fair sport and give it a go. \n\nThe fish sauce was a bit bland, but the crispy spring rolls we got for an appetizer were very good. For a main course I ordered the pineapple chicken (mild, obviously) and I actually wish I had maybe gone a step-up to medium. The flavor was great and all the ingredients were fresh. My boyfriend ordered a 5 chili tofu dish and tried not to act too ego-hurt when the girl next to him ordered 10 and lapped it down without batting an eye. \n\nThe place has a school cafeteria feel (long stainless steel tables and slatted benches to sit) and is every bit as loud. The service is a bit slow, but for as busy as it gets, it's really not that bad. I've definitely had worse in places with far less traffic, so I can't complain too much. \n\nThe best part has to be the price. Our appetizer, two mains and a pot of green tea (despite my thinking that should be complimentary everywhere...) only came to $24 (with tip).	1	0	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	QoS-r_exhve4bX3LzrzNSQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

This place caters to city workers who are regulars and they had me seated immediately and my server Rain immediately greeted me with water and asking If I knew what I wanted..Nope, because I'm not a regular but I decided in a few mins to go with the Thai Basil noodles with just veggies. he was right back to take my order and my food came in about 5 mins. delicious noodles and sauce, could be a few more veggies considering this was veg-only no chicken and should be more than 50cents cheaper to get veg-only. still, great value, great experience, highly recommended!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	2r_tIDna_GjTd0gRkqMKPw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

This is where it's at with Thai food.\n\nIf you go to Ryerson, you're up the creek with no paddle when it comes to decent food in the neighborhood. It's essentially street meat or Salad King.\nI'm not big on actually eating there, cause it has a sort of cafeteria vibe where everyone shares these long tables to eat. Cute if you want a fast lunch, but not exactly what I want for a dinner date.\n\nThe take out bar is the best. Amazing veggie options and everything comes with huge chilies. It's like a flavor explosion in your mouth on every bite.\n\nThe chili system goes from 1-10 for hotness, 10 being unbelievably hot. No really, you will pay if you get ten, but it will still be the most flavorful meal you ever have.\n\nSometimes I crave the curry after a night out so bad, I'd do almost anything for it.\nThat good.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	HikPdCQGk1mk5JsPjur7Nw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

CHcdObbOk3SKzpCX800CSQ	3	2017-07-03 00:00:00	I've been here numerous times and finally decided to write a review. I've tried various items on their menu but the only item I like is the Islamic noodles. I come solely for their Islamic noodles (it's the best Thai noodles I've had). I wouldn't recommend take out for this dish as the curry and the noodles are separated and requires them to be mixed. While I understand why this is done, I find it's not as tasty as having this dish fully prepared at the restaurant. Otherwise, I've found the other menu items quite bland at the medium spice level. \n\nSide note: beware of the spice level. I find it is very inconsistent between dishes and cooks.\n\nSeating for the restaurant consist of a few booth and is only available to parties of 4 or more. Otherwise, everyone else is seated at the communal tables. It's not the most comfortable seating arrangement and definitely not good for those with a bad back. \n\nOverall, it's a relaxed restaurant with quick service. I'll definitely be back for their Islamic noodles.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	633pZcCIaOTJLKxY0ZccRQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

(thanks to the Yelpers' tips).\nIt's an off - menu dish which is a combination of Thai noodles with Penang Curry sauce. It has a creamy coconut saucy taste with a spicy kick to it (I ordered 5 chillis). \n\nI went there around 5:30 and seated at the end of the long table, so it was abit quieter than usual. \nOur server was amazing. He was always attentive and was very polite. \n\n1 star taken away for their awful Phud-Thai, and the noise level (although it is expected and\nI complain about it how  every time I go, it probably won't stop me from going back :p)	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	J0g-zpTGHUu9wdsE0C4ljQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

A bit strange to find broccoli on it and the curry is on the sweet side but that's probably what makes it so memorable. \n\nI don't find anything else on the menu that notable but I have friends who find their fried rice excellent (I tend to disagree).

CQu29PbBc4-hANNL7xCAeg	4	2008-10-17 00:00:00	I had high hopes for salad king! Lines out the door, super packed all the time, the food must be good... right? Well I experienced Salad King in all its glory. I made reservations in advance, knowing how busy it gets. When we got there around 6:30, there was already a line out the door. We were escorted to the second floor, where the setting and atmosphere is totally different! It was almost a different restaurant. Table settings, glasses and cloth napkins aligned the dimly lit chill atmosphere, it like like *gasp* a normal restaurant, as oppose to a high school cafeteria.  \n\nWe were given a side of salted peanuts which were OK.  Different menu, and the prices may have been slightly higher. I was all gun-ho about trying the pad thai, but unfortunately they didn't have a vegetarian pad thai (without fish sauce)... There was only two things on the menu that were 100% vegetarian, the thai noodles and some tofu thing.  i opted for the noodles.  \n\nIt was very saucy, but surprisingly extremely delish. My boyfriend ordered the pad thai (lucky dog).  Others ordered the fish curry, tom yum soup and some duck dish.  All and all, people seemed impressed.  Except for maybe one incident where my friend bit down into a cherry tomato (from her fish curry) that tasted like propane.  YUCK! \n\nThe service was mediocre at best. The staff weren't overly friendly , but they were attentive.  I guess at a busy and popular place like this, they really don't need to have good customer service.	1	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ZZvfGGLnAkSBSUduV7KN-w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
CtZ3ig_S6GOuak-HnwERYQ	4	2013-08-06 00:00:00	I am giving this place four stars because of the food and the rather clever decor.   If, however, I put more weight on ambience it would get only three.  This is the kind of place to go to fill your stomach quickly with great food, but it is not conducive to a social dinner.\n\nFirst, the food and prices:   Very good bargain (cheaper by a dollart or more than most Thai places for the same dishes).   Despite the fact that the menu uses little Thai terminology, the dishes seemed to be authentic, as well as being very taster.  My tom yum had little sugar and one could tast the fish base in the broth, both of which seemed very positive to me.   A dish of penang curry included peanuts like it should and was excellent.  Service was quiet but sufficiently excellent.  I also liked the witty sayings on the wall and cute lighting.\n\nThe drawback of this place is the noise level  and uncomforatble seating (backless benches).  The large number of patrons and lack of acoustic paneling or tiles made it impossible for me to join in conversation with the others I was having dinner with.\n\nI think this is the kind of place that is good for students looking for a bargain dinner but not so good for older people like myself whose hearing has become less adequate over the years!	1	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	j6Kv_wLQzZMWobLIyijX3A	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Came here a couple times before and always ordered the same thing - chicken Phud Thai. This time I came and ordered it but it came back far too Sour. When I kindly asked for a replacement the waiter said sure. He proceeded to talk to the manager and she came back saying that they can't replace it but instead offered to pack it up and give extra peanuts.... She also said the recipe hasn't changed in 25 years and was adamant on the fact that the chef makes it the exact same every single time. Extremely rude and said that my taste buds changed.

They have raised the prices lately, bit it's still fairly reasonable and the place is always packed, so I guess it's still worth it.  Panang Curry is great here and the Siam Noodles have a wonderfully massive amount of extremely delicious peanut sauce on them.  Beef Satay is also a favourite.\n\nOnly negatives are that it's often very loud inside (due to the busyness and a solid ceiling) and you may be seated at a cafeteria style table if you have a small party (but that never bothered me).  The waits can also get a bit long and they don't take reservations for dinner.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	5r7V-CbHFxbrd-j0H-pdaw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I've gone several times and the service is always very quick and they have great portion sizes also!  It's usually enough for 2 meals for me!  They have tons of table space so I have never had to wait very long to be seated.\n\nIt's definitely not the best Thai food I've had but it's definitely not the worst either.  Definitely a good place to go that's central to just about everything downtown.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	MlvVwG3U-yYAdrPX7hUdXQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It's not going to be gourmet thai food from a high end restaurant, but its very tasty. The portions are typically more than I can handle, and as someone who enjoys spice, Salad King comes highly recommended.

They moved it into a strip mall north of the city which is disappointing. It had been a great mix of incredible food and experience.  \n\nTo the owners - bring back a more formal option to downtown.

dcEMoebhqK8iJs1ONTTukw	3	2013-12-12 00:00:00	This is a good place to go for a quick, inexpensive Thai meal. Their service is very fast and efficient, the food is good (likely not the highest quality but still very good) and  prices are reasonable ($10-18 for a plate). Most of the plates cater to Western palates as they often include coconut milk and sugar. \n\nAlso, every plate has the option of being made more spicy. There's about 7 different levels of spice. My friend and I tried the 5th level and died. We had to order a glass of milk to help us eat and still were only able to eat half of our serving.

Definitely felt the kick of the spice. The curry was nice and flavourful however the portion is a little small.  \nServers were friendly and food came in really fast. The only thing was they seemed to be in a rush to kick you out as soon as you finish. As this is a restaurant setting we were hoping to chat for a bit, but the server interrupted us to give us the bill.

It was very loud and the people sitting beside me were obnoxious,\n\nWe were a group of six and everyone ordered something different.\n\nI had the spring rolls first:  these were good with the dipping sauce\nmy main was the Siam noodles: first off my order got lost, so while everyone else at the table had their food and were eating, i still had to wait.  My order didn't arrive until most of my party were half way done. \nThe food itself was really good.  It was a mix of peanut and coconut sauce-yummy.  The portion was a good size too. (i ended packing up some of it as i was the last one eating)\n\nwould i go here again, maybe.	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	n8nVjwLH6ewD6D2q6L0ILg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
DHYwv9RQCmIao7-wpwaRXQ	3	2011-07-06 00:00:00	I'm not sure I should lower my expectations or if I'm being overly critical of the "New Salad King".  I've been a customer since the days it was a tiny, dark hole-in-the-wall eatery (before the first renovation at the recently burned down historical building on Gould St.).  A good friend of mine knows the owner and it was one of our favourite Thai food places for a bite.  The reason they had one of the busiest and best reputation for years was they actually had cooks from Thailand and he used the most expensive flour for his spring rolls (ever wonder why they weren't greasy and dripping in oil like other places serving spring rolls?).  The flour was extremely light and didn't hold much oil when fried and it made them crispy.  I was eager to try the new place.  The first time I stopped by and the line up was out the door and down the stairs spilling onto the street (it was about 2 weeks after re-opening at the new location) so we decided to eat elsewhere and come back another day.  The second attempt a few weeks later was successful as there was no lineup at prime time.  That may have been a mixed blessing... perhaps others shared the same experience as I did?\n\nThe service: We were seated immediately but after 10 minutes, no wait staff or anyone to even take our order.  This was not good as the old staff were excellent, very attentive, fast, courteous and easy on the eyes (at least the females were for me).  We were seated right near the door and wait staff had to pass by us to get to the kitchen (several did but we didn't know who was our server).  I was ready to get up and leave when a server asked us if we needed something... I said with a hint of sarcasm "water would be nice and someone to take our order."  She was polite and said she wasn't our server and he should be here any moment.  She brings us a glass of water and he finally showed up a minute later.  He was not apologetic, quite blunt and looked like he was doing us a favour to take our order (ah, typical mainlander... being Chinese I can say that).  The food took forever to arrive... the old place was 5-10 minutes tops and this was closer to 15-20 minutes.  I was wondering if they forgotten our order? They could have at least brought the spring roll appetizers first.  Nothing.  We had finished our water and not even a refill.  In my head, the tip was dropping by the minute.\n\nThe food: After about 20 minutes, our food finally arrives.  My friend order phad thai and I ordered mango chicken on rice.  I'm not sure if they still employ the same Thai cooks but the first thing I noticed was the spring rolls were a bit more oily than I recall at the old location... perhaps it's my memory that is failing me since it took them a while to re-open.  My mango chicken tasted good, portions were as I remembered and medium spice done right just like the good old days :)  At least that part didn't disappoint.  While eating, my friend and I chatted about the operation noticing there was more seating and there were empty spots which was rare at the old place.  Our delay in getting our meals may have been the kitchen staff not being able to cook as fast to accommodate the larger seating capacity.  We also noticed some guy, who looked like he was in charge, standing around and the owner was absent which was rare (did he sell out or did he actually take time off??).  Not sure but I'll need to come back to test these theories.\n\nThe verdict: I would usually give them a 4-5 star rating but my return here was a tad disappointing so a 3 star outing this time.  They have made improvements in the size, seating and fancier decor but I feel they sacrificed service and quality resulting from their expansion.  The prices went up a bit too (about a dollar a dish) which didn't make a huge difference but it makes you think about value compared to the old place.  I'll definitely come back and we'll chat with the owner (if he's still here) and give him some feedback about our experience.  If there is no lineups, I would think something is missing from their previous success formula.  Will be back for a review update here.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	mtC7hy-bMp17ZT5Zebo2xw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The Chilli rating they have is inconsistent though (been a few times) and when I ordered 3 chillies last time I definitely got something in the 10 chilli range which ruined my meal.

Will you go eat here and never have the urge to visit Thailand or try another Thai place again? No, hell no.\n\nIs it really tasty? Is it fairly affordable? Will you be satisfied with the meal you hurriedly stuff into your face? Yes, hell yes.\n\nAs I said, it has been a little while since I've been here; my last visit was still post-fire though... relax. I had the mango salad and the chicken pad thai - both were excellent, the atmosphere wasn't too loud either. Although I can believe that it does get quite noisy. \n\nAll in all, I would recommend it without hesitation.

All they told me was to go to the delivery company and they gave me no apology. When I went to the restaurant to pick up the sauce, the manager automatically thought that I work there just because I'm Asian. I was expecting for a sincere apology or at least pretending to give one. They didn't care anything I said. I recommend Salad King to read customer service books to study customers' psychology. After I mentioned the escalation and went back to the restaurant, the manager finally offered me something to make me quiet. I am very disappointed in this restaurant especially when I only talked good things about them in the past when my friends said Salad King is like cafeteria Thai food.

DPLCLhL728GZqlhiUFSXTg	5	2009-07-27 00:00:00	This is one of my top 5 restaurants in the world.  I'm absolutely serious.  If I were on death row, this would be my last meal.  Again, not exaggerating.  I once ate three straight meals at the Salad King -- and ordered the same thing each time!\n\nThe Salad King, with it's curious name, has the best Thai food of any restaurant I've ever been to anywhere, regardless of price.  The traditional phad thai and green curry dishes are our favorites.  The red curry is also very good.  The only thing they lack are cold spring rolls.\n\nTheir food is prepared in a style that I've never had anywhere else.  I have a feeling that if someone is unimpressed by the Salad King, it is because they are so used to a certain style of thai food that doesn't fit the SK mold.  Exhibit #1 is the phad thai.  None of the red tangy sauce (or ketchup as co-owner Ernest would say) you're used to.  It is cooked a light sauce that has a fresh taste allowing the rest of the flavors of the dish to jump out.\n\nOwners Linda and Ernest make the place go round ... and yes several years back they changed the place from a hole-in-the-wall university grub find to a trendy spot ... but the Salad King is unchanged in the quality of its food.  We no longer live in Toronto but its religion to visit "The King" each time.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	WQf8PYFWT0tjVjAN0rDYjQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I've eaten here a bunch of times and this most recent dining experience was no exception to the great food and service I've come to expect.\nI had previously tried the emerald and golden curry dishes which were both delicious with a really rich depth of flavour so I decided to try something similar but new for me: Evil Jungle Prince. It was a nice dish. Not quite as good as the curry dishes I had enjoyed before but definitely still tasty. It had good spice and hearty chunks of eggplant and baby corn.\nI'd be interested to explore more of the menu next time I come back, but the curry dishes are calling my name and I might have to return for what's tried tested and true. \nThe restaurant also has a fun and friendly atmosphere with their shared seating tables.	2	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	J77nvoepKNnqTI7fsPAZ9g	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

So much regret!\n\nAnother update:\nThe pink hair hostess was so rude. I can't wrap my head around as why she's so bad at such a simple job.. We arrived in the afternoon, the restaurant was not busy at all, nobody was in the line. She was standing behind the greeting table, me and my boyfriend waited few minutes for her to give us a seat as she was standing there looking away at nothing. We eventually waved at her and said Hi and she said Hi back WHILE looking away still... Later she led us to a table in the back and we requested to sit next to the window. She looked so annoyed but eventually led us there. For this entire time she looked angry and didn't smile once. Also we watched her led other parties to their seats, not that she looked like she hates this job, We saw a couple left because of her service. I like the food here and I always been a fan of this place. I don't want to give up just because the terrible service.

But to compare this to actual authentic Thai food, this place is trash. I don't get why everything tasted like peanut? And all of the stir fried choices are watery? If you have been to Thailand and had eaten real Thai food, you would have not come back for this. I get it that the price for a dish is really affordable, but I would definitely pay more to get better food.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	I2KbdFLMNB-gKMfnuEABhQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

They inform you on the spice levels, the ingredients, and anything else you want to know. \n\nWe've had their Phud Thai, fried rice, and curries...all which taste amazing.

DwuDfBVYSLMohtU0lqX-Og	4	2015-09-30 00:00:00	I've been a fan of salad king for over 10 years now, ever since their old location on Gould Street. Their seafood fried rice is by far my favourite, and they have just recently removed the mussel topping on it (which I usually request for them to remove anyway), so it works even better for me personally. They also give a generous amount of squids (10+) and shrimps (about 4 pieces) on their seafood fried rice, which I think is a pretty good deal for a tasty $10.25 dish.\n\nThey are very fast and efficient with takeouts. Their stamp card is a plus (buy 10 get one free) but they'd usually refuse to stamp multiple cards during group dinners (although some time, depending on your waiter/waitress, you can get a few stamped at the same time). They are often inconsistent with their chili measurement, so some days your dish may be much or less spicy than another (I like my dish spicy, but not deadly, so I think five chilis is usually a safe bet for me). Their "less oil" is also still quite oily, but I don't expect anyone to visit Salad King while they're trying to eat healthy on the first place - the "Salad" part of their name is definitely misleading. :)\n\nAnyway, overall, I love this place! Everything more or less tastes pretty great and they're affordable!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	yViMmyZcyCtBa8D7uGryaQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

A drawback is that the wait during friday lunch time is a pain to go through but the staff help you out.

I commonly go there for their amazing pad thai and other noodle dishes. Unfortunately their meat dishes are a bit disappointing, the sauce on top tends to be really liquid-y as if it's a soup. For that reason, I would not recommend getting meat dishes from here. Although I do recommend all the noodle dishes.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	H-znMpBeJh4bL2saP3hcmw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
Ea5ZY11DZAyDiMkMMRcDZQ	4	2017-05-09 00:00:00	- What I have tried:\n    + Mango salad (1/5): it's basically slices of mango and tomatoes in some lime juice, totally different from mango salad I eat at home, there was no meat either lol. I rather go to supermarket to get fresh mangoes than eating this salad.\n   + Thai Milk tea (2/5): completely different from all Thai milk tea I have tried (at Khao san, Pai, etc), the milk tea was so tasteless and I couldn't taste tea flavour.\n   + Green curry (4/5): not as good as Khao san but pretty decent as compared to the price, it was a bit on a sweeter side, I really enjoyed it tho.\n   + Panang curry (5/5): best one out of all three curries they offered. I got it with beef and it went extremely well.\n   + Islamic noodles (4/5): It's the only dish in their "secret menu", It was good, but too creamy that I couldn't finish all. One tip is that you should add more lime juice to balance the creaminess. \n   + Phud Thai (4/5): not as sweet or creamy as Islamic noodles, but more on the salty kinda sour taste. It was good tho.\n   + Thai Basil Noodles (5/5): Love this dish, very flavourful, I could finish the entire dish without  feeling sick. Highly recommend it.\n   + Siam Noodles (4/5): tastes like Islamic noodles but more on the sweeet side, and much creamier. I thought it was ok tho.\n- Portion: Generous amount of noodles, but not as much meat.\n- Price: Cheap compared to other Thai restaurants I have been to. If you want an affordable Thai food then go to this place, you won't regret it.\n- Place was big, but after lunch they closed the front area so there is usually a lineup for dinner.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	-3PTUP443q6hQESLKSu95w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It's great for groups that have different dietary restrictions because you can get most things vegan/vegetarian too! \n\nYou want it spicy? They can do that for you too! you actually can choose how mild or spicy you want you dish. Which I totally appreciate because some times I like to kick it up a notch,  y'know? \n\nJust a note- They have mostly communal tables, so if you don't like get cozy with strangers this isn't the place for you!	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	QxBIfPH-0JoOPpBKVQg8Bw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The decor is beautiful now, and the seating (benches) has baskets built right in for your coat or purse. \n\nI have one complaint that makes me not want to go back though. The NOISE. I couldn't hear my co-worker across the table from me, let alone any of my other co-workers. We were pretty much screaming the whole time. There's got to be a way to place sound absorbing panels in the ceiling. If you can handle this though, it's well worth a visit.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	JVAItWiIVzLZ-SK4Go2TxA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I loved the spicy scale of add 1 - 20 chili's, I like it hot...but 20 chili's, hello stomach ulcer!\n\nI tried the shrimp hot and sour soup...it was ok. The beef satay was peanut-y perfection. My friend had chicken won ton soup and spring rolls. \n\nVery filling, cheap and quick. The place is clean, staff were friendly. I actually quite like the sitting at tables with other groups, school dining hall-esque feel. Kind of reminded me of eating at Wvrst.\n\nYes it is not the quietest of places, if you are looking for something intimate then it's not really the place to go. I just thought there was something fun about the place.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	5gYF8vCPu6bs7kJ4dIB-9A	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
Ecw-KrSb8SScrd1CLiLB6Q	4	2009-07-06 00:00:00	I get take out from Salad King at least once a week and they have never let me down!  It's just up the street from where I work, and a great alternative to the Eaton Centre food courts.  The place is super busy, so it's a good idea to call your order in ahead, or you may have to wait 15-20 minutes for your food.  They have a great selection, including curries, stir fries, fried rice, soup, salad, spring rolls, and many vegetarian options.  There are options for the most cautious palate, as well as some for more adventurous eaters, and you can specify how hot and spicy you want your food.  Some of my regular choices are Shrimp Panang (delicious peanut sauce), Green Curry Shrimp, Seafood Fried Rice, and Spicy Tofu.  All are good, depending on my mood, and all are between about $8.50 and $10.00.  I have never eaten in there, but I imagine that due to the crowds, the service is probably no nonsense, efficient, but by no means relaxing!	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Sx5mok8jODu6g8s_jeLoVA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The food portions here are always good. You can also select the amount of chili peppers which is awesome (go for 10!).\n\nMust order their secret menu item if you come here which is the "Thai Islamic Noodles".\n\nAlways busy so avoid weekday lunch hour office crowd or call for reservations if they take em.	2	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Hci2c0qo98CO-Pv-VmV7gg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

They have been inconsistent with their spicy level. During my most recent visit, the hostess was also very rude - rolled her eyes at us when we requested a booth because it was 4pm with almost no other customers.

I've also had Pad Thai here as well as some of their curry dishes (that comes with rice). Everything they make here is delicious so you really can't go wrong.\n\nI haven't been here in months but if not much has changed, their prices are very decent and their portions are a good size. I'm sure the seating is still uncomfortable but since I'm guaranteed a delicious meal, I don't mind the seating at all.\n\nQuick note: there's storage space under the seats!\n\nMake sure you check out this restaurant but if you want to avoid lineups, go slightly before/after the lunch/dinner rush.	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	NzlqN1Ca9SW5z780thoiAg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Best deal around for Thai food. Good meal under $10. \n\nThere are more authentic restaurants around but part of the reason why we come here is simply to hang out with a group of friends and it's a central location for everyone to come to. We're not fans of the "other Thai restaurant" down the street. \n\nMy go to dishes: spring rolls to start at every meal, then I either get the classic pad Thai, Thai Islamic noodles, Pattaya chicken or the red curry. I've had pretty much everything on the menu over the years, but those are my faves. \n\nI have had friend brave enough to do 20 chilli in their curry. It did not go well - upset stomach for a few hours after. Just stick to 10 and under. Don't be a hero. Lol!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	PkRFSQgSfca9Tamq7b2LdQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

This cafeteria-style restaurant has some smart design - you don't have to put your jacket or bags on the floor because there's a storage basket under your seat. \n\nThey offer you the option of adding however many hot chili's you'd like to your dish (up to 20!).  I have had their spring rolls, green curry and their hot thai noodles.  They're a lot more filling than you'd expect, so bring your appetite.  The noodles are quite heavy, but I'm sure you'll be hungry after waiting an hour in line for their food.  They're accomodating.  It's affordable, with prices between $4- $10 for appetizers in the $10 range for dinner.  For its value, the food is quite good.  It's a bit loud, so if you come with a big group, expect to be screaming to your friend across the other side of the table.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	FNxjNKd2TRvi6LbsCA9HIQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The first time was a definite 5 star, and the second a 3 star, so here we are!\nThe food is overall, great. It is really reasonably priced -- as long as you don't over-order. The first time I went I had the chicken soup and shared the spring rolls with my friend and everything was super delicious (5 stars!). The second time I went, I ordered the large thai beer and it was huge -- way too much beer, and my boyfriend ordered the basil beef on top of the soups and spring rolls to share and it was way too much food (not to mention not that great in itself). \nBut, all in all, the food is really great and extremely inexpensive for what you get.

The food is so good and so cheap that I have no problem with a small wait or a large crowd. \n\nI have been to Salad King many of times now and I have never been disappointed with the quality or taste of their food. I can't get enough. You are able to choose how spicy (8 level of 'chillies') you want your meal to be with the majority of dishes. I hear a lot of people complaining about the long, shared tables and seating, but that is one of the greatest things I love about Salad King. Why is everyone afraid of other people? I love sitting so close to complete strangers. I have had the pleasure of even making new friends over lunch because of it. Isolation is boring, community is fun! \n\nThe noise is high but not outrageous. I would suggest you make your visit one with friends rather than a first date. There are many better places for a romantic evening, but few for a fun, lighthearted time.\n\n\nPROS:\nGreat food - tasty and fresh, awesome experience, making new friends. \n\nCONS:\ncan be busy during rush times.	2	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Vaj14Sp9HburSg6JFBijFg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
fALaEFrMDn70-HQhB7ygdw	4	2009-05-06 00:00:00	I've been a fan of Salad King since I first started studying at Ryerson six years ago. Over the years, the portion sizes have shrunken noticeably, but since it hasn't really affected the quality, I am happy to go back whenever I'm in the neighbourhood.\n\nMy two all time favourites are the unbeatably creamy and satisfying vegetable (or beef) panang curry with rice on those God awful blizzardy Toronto nights and the savoury yet sweet and limey bangkok stirfry (with shrimp or chicken) of glass noodles and oodles of veggies for warmer days. \n\nIf you've also got a sweet tooth like me, try the warm and sticky coconut rice with fresh mango slices too.\n\nTo avoid a long wait for seats, go with just one other person. It can get a little too loud for good conversation across the canteen table though. Complimenting strangers' food selections or making suggestions for first timers have been well received and provided good vibes in the past. I also enjoy going alone sometimes and snagging one of the elevated seats in front of the window to pedestrian watch.	2	0	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	MFnXQb1R1IGLL_-W4oflJw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Fb9n0QA66RaZXXsqP6KS8g	4	2011-02-23 00:00:00	After what seemed like an eternity, Salad King finally re-opened up yesterday (Feb 22nd) just across the road from the old location. I went for lunch shortly after 2pm today and the restaurant was at approximately 75% capacity, leading me to believe that the lunch rush must have been sheer chaos. Insane for their 2nd day back in business. \n\nIs it is as good as before? Yes and No. I ordered the legendary Thai Islamic Noodles 5 Chili and my guest the Chicken Panang mild. My noodles were just as I remembered them, the same silky smooth pink coco sauce with crunchy veg and a fair amount of protein. The portion however seemed to be smaller, maybe by 10-15%. Price of the TIN is now $10.00 flat. Is it worth it? Yes, but it has steadily gone up over the past 12-13 years that I have been visiting Sking, it's as if the price of this dish increases in correlation to that of cigarettes. \n\nThe flavour of the chicken panang sauce was outstanding and just as good as it used to be, however it was way too runny. The consistency was closer to soup and it should have been reduced way more, definitely not as runny as it used to be. The rice accompanying the panang was also in the shape of a pyramid, kinda. The entire base of the pyramid was crumbling and it simply did not look professional by any means. I could also see many other shotty pyramids passing by as staff delivered other patrons orders.  Rice portions dropped between 15% and 20% as well. Not cool \n\nLayout and decor of the new King is solid. Bigger and better bathrooms then before, and also an escalator to bring you to the main floor should you be unable to do so by yourself. Another great addition are the individual wooden chairs with baskets underneath, very helpful especially if you are carrying a purse or satchel (Indiana Jones carried one). \n\nBest thai in the city? Hell no. \nBest fast food thai in the city? Hell yes. \n\nWill I be back? Of course. I gotta get my Golden Curry & Thai Fried Rice fix ass well.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	HdUpeg9oYzvzHIgeJuM2uQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Since the name doesn't really tell you anything about what the place is actually like, I went in not knowing what to expect but came out a fan.\n\nI ordered the penang curry and my girlfriend ordered the fried rice. Both dishes came pretty fast and the service was good for the fast-foody environment. \n\nEach dish is surprisingly large for the price and comes prepared well. I really liked the fried rice that my girlfriend got and it was comparable to the likes of Khao San Road. The penang curry I got was average however, and felt slightly too watery. I would definitely rate the curry dishes lower than Khao San Road and Pai Northern Thai - but hey, its probably about $5-$7 cheaper here so its still worth it. \n\nOverall:\n-Good service and surprisingly cheap prices\n-Would recommend getting the fried rice dishes over the curry dishes\n-Noisy and busy atmosphere	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	gW1l1Ubn4CcKjeJ1fR74aw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The pad thai is solid, and the restaurant just delivers on what it's decor promises: good thai food, quickly and without being expensive.  Plus the common-table sitting lets you meet fun, new people if that's your thing.\n\nA word of warning: the chili scale goes from 0-20, with the upper regions (15-20) being reserved from east asian natives and drunk frat boys.  There is a story out there of such a frat boy going for level 20 chilis, and having to be stretchered out due to projectile vomiting (consider yourselves warned!).\n\nIf you like it hot, or can contain your chili enthusiasm, then this is a great place to grab lunch!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	yQ0ABKYPrKm3Yp7oqZ9pNg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It makes me ignore the spicy taste and just enjoy the flavour. I always order pad thai, and not even Spring Rolls or all the other pad thais I've ordered have been able to top theirs off.

This is the second time I've eaten here, and I think it may be my last. On a busy saturday, you wouldn't think so much of the staff would be standing around doing nothing when we were ready to order. It was pretty hard to call someone over to take our order. When the food arrived it was room temperature and below average in taste. We spoke to the manager, to let her know and she very understanding and gave us a discount right away without hesitation.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	z6qIyc-_oIbgDWAembZ04w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
ftFhj9aNBDrA4Jb8ySnO1g	3	2015-12-21 00:00:00	Came here on a Sunday evening and had the pad thai & panang curry. Pad thai was a little too sour for my taste and the tofu in it tasted a bit off. The panang curry was quite flavourful, though the portion size was on the smaller side. Service is quick and efficient. Very conveniently located. I don't think there's any other decent Thai food in the Eaton Centre area. Communal seating is ok but I wish they had coat racks instead of the bin under the stools. I mean it's nothing to rave about but it'll do the trick if you're craving some Thai food.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ay1vHGcKovq8tBeTvqJ38w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It's basically hot thai noodles smothered in coconut milk sauce!!!)\n\nTheir curry dishes are pretty good as well, green curry and red curry are among my favorites.\n\nI have hard time choosing between a curry dish and a noodle dish every time I go.\n\nThe seating could be a bit crowding, but it's a busy place, at least the service is quick and nice.

The ambiance is not conducive to conversations so I would not recommend this restaurant for a first date but if you are in the neighborhood looking for a quick bite, this place is great as they are very fast. I usually order the tom yum soup to start, unlike other restaurants, you can taste their ingredients and their broth is very clear. Their satay skewers are also delicious and their peanut sauce is always fresh. With any of their curries, you can customize how spicy you would like it. I've tasted their green curry and panang curry and find both a good choice. Their chicken and vegetable portions are equal and of course there is rice provided to pour all that sauce over. Their Bangkok stir fry is also a good option for those who prefer noodles and their street noodle soup is a lovely soup based, noodle dish for cold days like today.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	73-0YwihQK87y7oH_pO_1w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I take my friends here.\n3 stars = Somewhat worth it... if you have nowhere better to go.\n2 stars = Below average. Attend only when necessary.\n1 star = Do not visit!\n\n\nThe Salad King serves "Asian fusion" cuisine, which is code that means if you've never really had good Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, or Korean food you should find their food satisfactory. It's a fast food joint that has the decor of one of the nearby condos. Think: lighting by Ikea.\n\nI find it amusing that people get excited about these places. It's basically a Taco Bell for Pad Thai and Chicken on Rice. There's little flavour, little passion, and little care as they churn out Pad Thai with Chicken ($10) Pad Thai with Shrimp ($10) or Pad Thai with Both! ($10) to a new batch of Condo owners and University students every year. There's some variety in the spiciness of the dishes, but it's nothing you can't simulate at home with some Tabasco sauce or chili pepper flakes.\n\nIf you a want a fast plate of food and a hip atmosphere, come here and chat with your buddies before you hit the AMC for the latest Vin Diesel picture. If you want tasty Asian food with some authenticity and complex flavour, put the King in check, and go to one of the 50 better restaurants Toronto offers up.\n\nI offer 3 stars instead of 2 because the prices are reasonable.\n\n3 stars	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	UlDSb1B22ON7WXcY3JbmNQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It's like eating in the Top Chef kitchen.\nNothing wrong with that, it makes everything look clean and organized which is important for any restaurant. The long communal seating is comfortable and practical, while the booth seating in the gazebo are more intimate and less industrial in nature. \n\nEither one, taste n preference, will make for a pleasant dining experience.\nI ordered the green curry. It was good, thin and soupy with the standard beef, chicken or shrimp choices. Standard trimmings.\n\nMy gf ordered the Islamic noodles which is discontinued from the current menu but was on the menu before. These are bomb. I think it's the only dish I will order going forward at Salad King. It's a curried rice vermicelli with choice of meat and a veggie medley stirred in. It's delicious.\n\nOverall, salad king is a good casual thai restaurant. The prices are reasonable, drinks are available and it's clean. Service is also really good, so don't be afraid to ask questions, they actually answer them.	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	P7EV3yrn1PLHDBX6rF6qIg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
gcb3fls5mpKQ-a6dou2EuQ	3	2011-04-05 00:00:00	Salad King is not necessarily the King of Salad. I don't like their mango salad but I do like other things!\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of the curries basically. Panang and green- my faves. I don't sing over them like other places but pretty decent and a good-sized portion. Pyramid of rice + container of curry= enough for two mealz. I've had hits and misses with the pad thai, sometimes it's dry. And no matter what I go in thinking I always wind up sharing spring rolls with someone. Can't resist. \n\nThis new place is a zoo! If you are two people, prepare to be packed tightly between other couples. Like, this is not the place to go to have a private conversation even though it does get pretty loud. It`s good though because it keeps the waits very short. But they won't seat you with out the full party! Get there on time/together. \n\nSo frustrating: whenever I go here I ask for the "Niiice" amount spice (3 chillies) and always wind up getting talked out of it. Discrimination! So stick with your gut, people; order what you want. I just keep forgetting which one I picked last so I am documenting it here. Also, why don't I get chopsticks? I love chopsticks. \n\nIn terms of Thai food, you could do better but it is cheap, satisfying and in quite close proximity to me when the craving hits.	2	2	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	3uWCWMWcrn8YSH_qBvlr6w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

However the student like prices feel good so I decided to check them out at their new location on Yonge Street. I settled on the Panang Curry with Chicken without much dilemma. Order was pronto..within 5-10 minutes I was served with my food. And boy, the food was wonderful. I am not judge of authentic Thai food, but the taste of this dish and the smell of the other herbs and spices were magical to my nose and tongue sensors. My friends ordered Golden Curry with chicken, Spicy Chicken with rice and Golden Tofu and all of them had nothing but good words for this place.\n\nPros: Prices. Not a single menu over $10 and this is hard to beat in a location on Yonge Street. Very good tasting food.\n\nCons: Very busy place - one may have to wait for long times. Also one may have the misfortune to be fitted in to one of their "Everyone table" where you do not get privacy and have to sit with random strangers. That is a great thing for speed dating, but maybe not for a food joint.\n\nOverall, a definite repeat in 1-2 months time.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	i0MQ0qCZy0_K8BrfE164bA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

That being said, Salad King is NOT a place for lounging or quiet conversation.\n\nThe only 'downside' to Salad King is its atmosphere if you don't know what to expect. There are very few individual tables - most of the seating is composed of long metal tables that span the width of the restaurant. As a result, you and your party end up sitting elbow-to-elbow with strangers (and I do mean elbow-to-elbow - Salad King is always busy). \n\nThe food is consistently good, and you can choose the number of chilies (/spice-level) to add to your meal. Though the scale goes all the way to 20, 4 chilies add a good amount of kick without hijacking the flavour of your food. The spicy mussels are my go-to dish, though the curries are also very tasty.\n\nThe wait staff is fast and efficient, like a well-oiled machine. \n\nSalad King was one of my favourite spots to grab lunch while living on-campus at Ryerson, and definitely merits a visit.

We kept on adding people to the table so everyone was a bit squished, but that's our fault really. Even then 12 people all fit comfortably on around 3 or 4 tables. \n\nOur server was very attentive, constantly refilling our water and attending to us promptly. They gave out free samples of beer, and they made sure to check ID too. Food arrived quickly, although for some reason mine arrived a good 5-10 minutes before everybody else's. I wasn't complaining though; I ordered the street noodle soup with 15 chilis, I needed to have the most time for the noodle to cool down. The green tea milkshake was delicious and heaven sent for my slightly-abused taste buds (I have a pretty high tolerance for spicy), although others would probably complain about it being too sweet. Actually, one friend of mine tried my soup and said it was disgusting, as the peppers completely overwhelmed any other potential flavour. I didn't really mind though, I rather liked it. To each their own, I suppose.\n\nOne problem: there wasn't a drinks menu, so I had to ask my server what type of drinks they had.\n\nI am definitely going to bring my parents here sometime.

I used to love this place for the uniquely frenzied atmosphere, crazy spice scale, and most importantly, good food.  I came here for lunch last Thursday, and the first thing to greet me was a sign on the door proclaiming, "Now serving Khao Soi!". SWEET! One of my favs from Khao San Road!!  I'm definitely ordering it to compare! Well sadly, there was no comparison, and after trying the khao soi, it is apparent that Salad King is just keeping up with the status quo, instead of coming up with anything original.  My khao soi came in the most watery, runny sauce imagineable, and when I looked around at my other dining companions who had ordered their usual favs like the green curry, I realized that everyone's dish was watered down!!  Not cool, Salad King!  You can't serve curry that can be mistaken for tom yum soup.\n\nSadly, I think I will still keep coming back to Salad King, in the same way I kept watching The Simpson long after I should've stopped. There's just something about it that holds a special place in my heart, and really, it's not THAT bad...	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	-dbWm5L_Ol2hZeLRoQOK7w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

But I am hard to *impress*, like the way everyone who took me there was impresssed with Salad King.\nMy sister and her friends (all Ryersonians) were so excited about going that I was accordingly excited about being invited along for what revealed itself to be something of a beloved ritual.  \n\nWell, no disrespect meant (it's certainly better than the food I usually have access to when on *my* former campus), but it's really nothing special, as far as I can tell. They do that litter "pepper meter" or whatever they call it, and nobody likes shtick more than this guy right here, but all I remember was that my mango chicken was *far* too watery for it to be on purpose. It was ok, certainly not spectacular. The spring rolls were from the right side of the tracks (ie. good, in springroll town). \n\nOh, and it was super crowded. Is. Always.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	BMmtD4a2uTyFxDJ2qHUbSw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
H3Vtgz6YoVBFMaslEUmjZA	3	2010-10-22 00:00:00	Oh, Salad King. You introduced me to Thai food, and I'll always love you for it. Alas, some things must be said: Salad King is good, but not great. Salad King keeps drawing people because (1) it has a great location, and (2) the food is pretty cheap.\n\nThe best compliment I could ever give the Salad King is that it is very consistent. I've never had a bad curry at the Salad King, and that alone makes it worth visiting.\n\nI'm gonna echo the sentiment of some of the previous reviewers: the seating arrangement can be very awkward. Don't be surprised to find yourself sitting next to some very loud and obnoxious people. This pretty much ruins the whole dining experience for me. If you don't mind listening in other people's conversations, then by all means, visit the Salad King.	2	0	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	UWXdAdrZi5I4RB2RHZesuw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It was a decent dish. \n\nThai Basil Noodle: 3/5 Nothing in particular, lacking a little salt in my opinion. \n\nPortion size is a little to the smaller size. \n\nCustomer Service: 1/5 Maybe my friends and I went at the wrong time. But it seems like the restaurant was understaffed. ( many bus boys/ girls, but not enough servers and waiters). When the food finally came the server asked if we wanted some plates to share our food. We said YES. But she forgot, so I asked 2 different bus boy and bus girl to get some plates for us. 1 said he'll get our server... the other didn't even reply ( the restaurant was really busy, however it's just getting plates, not no one wants to do it) so I went over to the small room where they store takeout boxes and took 3 styrofoam takeout boxes myself to use. \n\nOverall experience: 1.5/5 Food was decent, can't complain since it was super busy. However the customer  service was really lacking. Nothing to hype over about.	0	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Ln4e5YUK31FoAm03UpwfUQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
hA7FKjvDl5oY1Rhwi-iZiA	5	2011-05-15 00:00:00	For whatever reason, I'm not much of a Thai food fan.  It is one of my least favourite of the Asian styles of food.  I've tried many Thai places in the city and none have really done it for me.  Salad King, on the other hand, is a different story.  I like everything about this place.  I like the cafeteria style seats, I like the service, I like the food.  The seating, believe it or not, actually makes people more social and conversations with strangers at the table are fairly common.  A rare sight, indeed, in this city.  The food prices are awesome for what you get.  Presentation is great, although that matters little to me, and the food is delicious.  To be honest, I have no idea how traditional Thai is or how faithful Salad King is to that, but I don't care, the food is great.  I really wouldn't have them change a thing.	2	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	oLLYmkej2TMHaTbudug5eA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

hBcTHm-yn9gDOt75Ds4f8g	3	2015-04-18 00:00:00	This is a popular place, especially for students as its right across Ryerson University and in the core area of Yonge and Dundas.\n\nI recommend the siam fried rice and phud thai fry noodles in shrimp or chicken. Food here is okay but dont expect the same quality as Khao San Road or Pai restaurant. If you are looking for something more affordable and are in the area, Salad King is a good option to check out. \n\nIf you are new to Salad King you might be surprised at the seating arrangements. They have these long metal tables where you would need to eat next to strangers. This is to fit the maximum number of people in the restaurant. They also added small tables so now you can sit in groups of 4 or so too, however getting seats there are kind of difficult.\n\nTips: go in smaller groups, its easier to get seating that way. They only do reservations at lunch and you can pick up any food orders there but no delivery.\n\nGreat for lunches and dinners with friends, family, coworkers and casual dates. Its pretty loud so don't come here if you have something important to discuss.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	HBBv6M03xLEGmM-HYztQUg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

HGxYuF0MG_kc7mbFENojFw	3	2015-08-13 00:00:00	Ordered their mango salad, satay chicken skewers, golden curry with chicken and rainbow chicken.  Mango salad taste was kind of bland, prob won't order it again. The satay chicken skewers were really good, would recommend it.  The golden curry was a bit on the sweet side, also little watery( not too thick sauce) I find it a bit bland for tast, but my girlfriend really liked it. She described the curry as "tasted rich, however lacking in complexity".  (she did eventually put some chilly sauce into the curry though lol. I guess I prefer a bit more strong flavored when it comes to curry, but I think it may please many ppl who likes a mild tasting style for curry.  The rainbow chicken is really dissapointment though, tasted like broiled chicken soaked in watery sauce that tasted somewhat like a watered down Tum Yum Gong soup.  Definitely would not order it again. I think next time if we come back again, we will try out the Islamic noodle everyone has been raving about in the reviews.	2	1	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	--YhjyV-ce1nFLYxP49C5A	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
hH-0nCy532F9NcSgxZ4sAA	1	2012-08-27 00:00:00	Ignore the hype.\n\nI feel that it is my civic duty as a Torontonian to recommend against this place. This place deserves a sadface. If I could replace the stars above with sadfaces, this place would get fullout 5 sadfaces.\n\nThe food was beyond hideous. One time I got this awful, watery Thai soup at the Just Thai on Church St. and I vowed to myself never to go for cheap Thai food again. \n\nI had been to Salad King many years ago in the old location and the curry was okay so I thought that that, plus decent reviews on Yelp, plus the fact that it's quite pricey, plus the fact that Khao San was closed (Sunday) called for a second visit.\n\nHow wrong I was. Maybe it's under new management, I have no idea.\n\nThe Rainbow Chicken ($8.25) was a travesty. Plain water as broth had separated from the spiciness that leaves that distinctly gross orange oil as a film on my food. And that's not to say that it flavoured the food at all: the chicken was white, rubbery and devoid of all taste; the fixings were as cheap as they come (think frozen peas,  and onions) and I received 3, tiny, almost-white eggplants that tasted raw and half-cooked. Trust me, there was no lemongrass to be tasted in this dish. Simply hideous.\n\nMy partner got the Thai Noodle Soup ($7.25) and was sorely disappointed. The broth, as well, was some murky, Campbell's soup stock nonsense and the fixings were also on the cheap (celery in a Thai dish? Really?). \n\nFor $20, I feel I deserved more. And having eaten Thai food in Thailand, I know so much more is possible for $20--not this fast food, reheated slop.\n\nWe wanted to get the mango sticky rice but judging by the quality of the entrees, we decided to cut our losses and head out.\n\nSo to sum up: you're getting fast-food Thai that barely deserves the name. You can get much better Thai at authentic places like Mengrai Thai if you can trek further East than Yonge (yes, you CAN).\n\nThe only positive aspects are the friendly wait staff and the awesome location and great atmosphere in the restaurant. So if you're allowed to come in and sit and chat, then by all means go to Salad King; if not, avoid at all costs.	3	2	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	75em7pLz3PEjl9p2i-GNAA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
hiJltXOhcYJFm5tO_rC1OQ	3	2014-07-31 00:00:00	I've been here twice in the past few weeks and I have to say that I've had a very consistent experience. The pad thai - or phud thai, as they call it here - is pretty standard. I would warn against being too liberal with the spiciness levels as they do go up quite quickly and dramatically. The serving size is quite generous and I like to share it with someone else. Usually I find that a salad or another appetizer plus the pad thai is enough for two. Their salads are not particularly interesting - the mango salad consisted primarily of sliced mangoes, which is a stark contrast to the usual mango salad where you get a bed of lettuce topped sparsely with mangoes.\n \nOverall Salad King is really inexpensive and the service is fast. The trade-off is that there are communal tables - where you'll probably end up if you're in a small party - and that the restaurant space can be quite loud. I've found myself yelling both times I went there so I've resolved to only go back to Salad King when conversation isn't the focal point of the meal.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	yVI5J7NGd_WtavM20dBBQw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
hmn2Netqh4DYeWG7V7_4Dw	4	2008-08-07 00:00:00	hands down best thai in toronto. i'm always totally satisfied in the food here, as is my non-thai-food-loving husband (that really says a lot). the place is styled like a cafeteria, though, and it's very loud and full of ryerson students. there's a quiet version of the same restaurant upstairs called Linda, but prices are about twice as much and for me it's not worth it. just be prepared to wait a long time if you are with a big group.\n\none thing i love is that your glass will never go dry. i always wondered why places that served spicy food had such bad service (you know, your mouth is burning and you can't find the guy with the pitcher of water) but here they're topping off your glass before it's even half empty. gotta love it!\n\nif you have the option, don't go during normal meal hours. i was there today at 1pm and i waited over 1/2 hour just for takeout. it's always totally packed.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ruKI02UFEyBcvow5DXoGRQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
hn0NmaFm5ZqAjufSt0XcpA	4	2011-06-19 00:00:00	I liked this restaurant before it burned down because the way the seats are set up reminds me of the days my brothers took me to little restaurants back in Korea, when I was like....6.\n\nI was mortified to find that this was in the building that had burnt down and was about to go into pout mode when my observant friend found the restaurant across the street.\n\nTHANK GOODNESS FOR HIM; A HUNGRY SHYNI IS A BITCH.\n\nI LOVE IT MORE NOW - THE NEW DECOR IS FABULOUS. \ni LOVE the cheeky posters/ murals whatever - they make me laugh. \nI love the washroom door that says that is the way to true happiness  - finally someone agrees that washroom relief is really second to very few - I particularly love the girl in the signage that crosses her legs... because truly, no girl desperately in need to go to the washroom, stands in perfect stance...as so many washroom signage lead you to believe.\nI love the open space  concept... love the colours....I would come just for the decor, really.\n\nWARNING: BELIEVE THE WAITRESS WHEN SHE SAYS THAT ONE CHILI IS HOT.\n\nLOOK AT MY PICTURE OF THE FOOD I HAD; it is deceivingly mild looking. THAT is a ONE chili. I am  no foreigner to spicy food- heck, I believe there to be some genetic tolerance for spice built into my body, seeing that the main dish in Korean food is Kim chi and that,can be some spicy shit.\n\nThis dish was delicious - but the temperature of the food raised the spicy level even higher and by the time i was full, my nose and eyes were running a marathon.\nI realized the next day that, even when the food is cold - that didn't help the spiciness - my mouth caught fire on the 3rd spoonful - thank goodness there was only 5 more bites left.\n\nThe only downfall of this place: they have NO cold spring rolls which caused me to give it a 4 star. If you're reading this, Mr. ownerman of Salad king, please add cold spring rolls (with carrots, lettuce, cilantro, vermi noodles and shrimp) and you will be promptly upgraded to 5 stars.	0	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	StCSYeJ1I-G1LbdpW65kGQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I ordered the Bangkok Stir Fry; however, I was brought the Chicken Phud Thai instead.  Rather than exchanging my dish, my server showed me that he had written down Pad Thai and left the table without an apology.

hZ3LuWzBtqd_cOBHu4AgmA	3	2016-10-25 00:00:00	Ok so I know Salad King is like thee place for students in the area etc and their Phud thai or Pad thai or whatever is not half bad. The price can't be beat and all that.  I get it. So for those students brandishing their chopsticks ready to gouge my eyes out over this review i do sincerely apologize.  I am only writing this negative review about one thing. \n\nI FRIKIN LOVE TOM KHA GAI SOUP. you need to know that first. \n\nSo rewind to yesterday where I have caught myself a nasty cold right? sore throat, coughing, sneezing all that unpleasant stuff and let me tell you it was a miserable night walking home in the wind downtown last night. Am I right? \n\nSo anyway I get home and decide "damn man I really want me some sweet coconut and chicken soup right now! It will just really be damn good for my throat and all that" So i get excited and bring up some thai restaurants. Now my favs for some reason on the delivery service sites don't offer Tom Kha gai. (whats up with that guys? afraid your soup will spill? Do what kenzo ramen does. put the soup in a bag then in a container!! who knew!!??) So then i happen upon Salad King. Thinking hey their foods pretty good and cheap. Lets go with that. \n\nSo I ordered a healthy dose of Tom Kha gai, like two so i could make one giant bowl of soup and some pad thai for good gluttonous measure. \n\nSo i waited the allotted time and it came. Super excited now and coughing up a storm. \n\nSo here's the thing. When i get out the soup i notice ok weird its got a weird like orange dark watery look to it. Not the usual beautiful white creamy coconut magic look where you just want to dive in and bathe in its boiling hot goodness (even tho you would probably burn to death and that wouldn't be good for you at all) \n\nSo then I start stirring right? and what do i see to my surprise. BUT LETTUCE. so I'm like what the?  thats weird I have never seen lettuce in this soup before. Is this like a, we're mad at you for ordering from a service instead of coming to our restaurant deal? Is it like payback?  So i take a taste... IT TASTES LIKE LETTUCE!!! \n\nWHO THE @#*$ PUTS LETTUCE IN TOM KHA GAI SOUP!!!??? \n\n(to any cultural recipes that actually put lettuce in tom kha gai i am so sorry for insulting or questioning your cultural choices)  \n\nCome on Salad King!!??? LETTUCE??? IN COCONUT CHICKEN MUSHROOM SOUP??? it was gross and soggy and just plain disgusting. \n\nI cried \n\nI did! I really cried. I was so sad and disappointed. So moral of the story. When you are thinking of choosing Salad king for your Tom Khai Gai needs. DON'T They put friggin lettuce in their Tom Kha Gai. \n\nBut I gave them two extra stars for their amazing Phud Thai! and their tofu, man i love the way they do their Tofu. BUT LETTUCE?? COME ON GUYS!! \n\nalso.  say Tom Kha Gai as many times as you want. Go on try it. its fun. Say it over and over. I know you want to\n\ncheers	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	To6B7WBAX_DJtbU8iDNrug	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I had their number on speed dial and would need to have Panang Curry at least once a month to keep my world from crashing. \n\nBut ever since it's opened backed up, the Panang and a bunch of their other dishes just isn't the same. I'm assuming they've changed their chef... because the curries don't taste the same and overall it's just so disappointing. \n\nDon't get me wrong, Salad King still serves good food, but it is just no longer drool worthy enough for me to consistently come back every month.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	zwMbR-YNdSV33p28hGdKMQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Thai Islamic Style Noodles.  I must admit.. it was better than what I ordered.  It was so good, other people in the restaurant came up and asked him what he ordered just based on the smell.

Oops.\n\nEating at salad king feels like eating at a cafeteria. Everyone's sitting on large tables arranged in rows, with strangers beside you. Well, that's if you're seated at that half of the restaurant. The other half of the restaurant feels like you're in a cafe. It's quite a design really.\n\nApparently there are some off-menu items, but I just went with what's on the menu.\nWhat you'll notice is that prices are cheaper than some other thai places like sukho or KSR or pai. Perhaps this is catered towards a student budget, given that they offer 20% off for ryerson students.\n\nI ordered the thai noodle soup. It felt like eating pho given that it uses similar ingredients, but I found that with 5-chilis it wasn't all that spicy. Perhaps because it is a soup item, or maybe 5 isn't really that spicy. There wasn't much flavour in the noodles though, which is unfortunate.\n\nThe portions of all the dishes are pretty good, despite the lower prices.\nPerhaps noodle soup isn't the best choice here.	3	0	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	CQ67NJigSe5-uBDX3b_CUw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

iFumkbeY4FeV73m-YxNFcA	4	2017-04-27 00:00:00	Upon entering, I thought the waitress standing at the front was kinda rude. They did not acknowledge us until we stood in front of them asking for a table of 3. \n\nAside from that, our waiter was nice and the food was good. It was our first time here, but I've been hearing from friends that their Pad Thai is good, so we order Pad Thai with chicken, Mango Chicken, Golden Curry, and Mango Salad. We all opted for mild spiciness level (we weren't too sure how spicy their spiciness is lol). \n\nThe Pad Thai was good, I like it more than other places. It wasn't as red as I expected and the noodles were chewy. The Mango Chicken smelled really strong and the taste was a little sweet. I liked it, but I can see it as a hit or miss for some depending on their taste buds. The Golden Curry was really good! The chicken was tender and the sauce and everything was full of flavour. I wish I asked for more chili though cause it would have tasted better (I'll know for next time!) The Mango Salad was a little meh. It's the only place I know that doesn't ads peppers and there's actual Mango sauce. I didnt mind it cause it was sweet and the Mango itself was actually pretty sour..but I probably won't order it again. \n\nThe food portion was good and the price was decent. I'll probably be back next time to try out their secret menu item: Islamic noodles?!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ioF_-mjVYQDO7LvSd7IUMg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It's a good and reliable choice for thai-asian food.\n\nIt's conveniently located, reasonably priced, and they have a wide variety of dishes. \nI enjoy the Garlic shrimp and Siam noodles. The Islamic noodles, not listed on their menu, is also a go-to choice. Ask for spicy! \nI always need to add hot sauce for flavour.\n\nI would recommend this place for lunch or a very casual after-work dinner! Prices are between $10-12 :)\nIt is normally pretty busy and the seating is communal cafeteria style.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	4YyVKh2S5XlxQi9RtNmVew	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The prices are reasonable, the service is fine, and the decor is colourful and casual.\nSome of the noodle dishes are very good, but the curries and stir frys are just disappointing - not the tastiness I would expect from thai food at all. The papaya salad is terrible. \nThey have a 'chilli rating' where you can up the spice, but for people who like it really hot (not me, but friends I've dined here with) it just doesn't deliver- the max (20 chillis) is just not that hot.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ULA5Q3D1O757eLbQdAnIXA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

And 15 years later, it has transformed into a hip restaurant. But the affordable pricing remains!\n\nI had the golden curry with chicken ($9) and spring rolls ($4.5). Yummy!

jBprcMiBeZhnndYrvmskRA	4	2017-02-24 00:00:00	I've visited this location many times, each time trying something different, and every time I've been very impressed with the quality of food, service and overall value of the experience.\nEntering the facility is quite odd, as it is on the 2nd floor of the building. Space is tight, so on busy nights you may not have much room to manoeuvre. And boy does it get busy (For good reason).\n\nI've tried a few dishes in the past but the most recent one I remember was the Pad Thai, so I'll talk about that. I was able to add both Chicken and Shrimp to my meal, and the server was very accommodating in getting my order the way I liked it. The flavour was very consistent throughout the dish and it tasted very genuine. The portion of my meal was average, as a big eater I usually end up hungry after eating out and this was no exception, but for the price I feel it was worth it. \n\nPros:\nGood food quality\nGood value for thai food\nService is quick and efficient and accommodating (quick turnover)\nDecent portion size\nEasy accessibility downtown\n\nCons:\nCan be an extremely long wait \nSeats are slightly uncomfortable - Basically sitting on a stool\nCan get quite loud\nSeating is packed - You can listen to the conversation of the individuals next to you :|	2	0	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	058cxpL_2n-PmPzUjNUjSw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

We were greeted right away and seated within 5 minutes even though this place was almost full and there were other people waiting. \n\nDespite being very busy, our server was attentive and accommodating-  almost 10 minutes after we ordered I realized that I had ordered to wrong item. I asked our server about it and he changed it for me with no problems (he was very nice about it too, didn't make me feel bad about it)\n\nNow for the food:\n- Siam noodles with beef: a little too sweet but delicious and satisfying 3.5/5\n- green mango salad: a bit more sour than we liked but very generous portion 3/5\n- seafood combination: nice amount of heat, plenty of squid and shrimp 4/5\n- Sapporo on tap was more bitter than usual, a little concerned about when the lines were last cleaned.\n\nLove the location and the atmosphere is so high energy, we will be back!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	nGNaJkd0Fv-cl5ddMBrvHg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

JjvU-BdnhUkDCwetTwE2Ag	4	2010-06-17 00:00:00	I adore salad king. It's fast. It's frikkin delicious. It's reasonably priced. Did I mention that it's delicious? And they can make everything spicy enough that it hurts me, which is hard to attain and a constant goal for me.\n\nI especially love the golden curry with tofu - I eat meat, but sometimes a girl just needs some soy product swimming in rich yellow sauce. I also adore the bangkok stirfry, which is less saucy but full of vegetables, chicken, and shrimp - one order feeds me for two meals. The cold rolls are sort of run of the mill, but they're cold rolls, so there's only so much you can do with them, I suppose.\n\nI'm not super fussed on the cafeteria style dining set up, so I usually get take away, but there are times that the loud, communal eating set up has its own appeal. It's sort of nice to get lost in the noise, but only very occasionally. If I can score a seat in the front window, I can watch the world go by while I munch.\n\nAlso, the hours don't thrill me. They close at 9 most nights, which is often exactly when I'm thinking about eating. And they're closed entirely on Sundays. Who even does that anymore?	2	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	xdYAjnWeAHQfcLH7c2l4OQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

When we arrived the wait was about 20 minutes for our party of 5. However, once we were seated, we had a pleasant waitress and the service was great. The atmosphere is simple, clean, and contemporary. We started off with the crispy spring rolls which were delicious. For the main course ordered the spicy chicken, orange chicken, phud thai with shrimp, and green mango salad. They were all quite tasty. You can also choose the level of spiciness of your entree. The restaurant is very well priced at about $8-10 dollars an entree. The portions are also pretty large. \n\nOverall the experience at Salad King was positive one. You can tell by the crowds that it is very popular. Though Toronto is full of great restaurants, I would definitely recommend Salad King as a tasty and economical option when in the city.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	rr6iz7FJiNt7uyssDAEt2Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Both have too much coconut cream to the point that they actually taste sweet. The ingredients aren't really Thai either. At $9 for the curries it is pretty cheap which is probably the only real thing which it has going for it.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	LJICWu_4_nMNdwYXLpJbZg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I had heard from another yelp elite friend about some dish off the menu called Islamic noodles and decided to try it. And I have to say that it was absolutely delicious! It's basically noodles with vegetables and your  choice of protein tossed in a nicely seasoned creamy curry sauce. Sooo good!! This is a dish I will definitely order again. \nOn the bad side, the water quality here is really really bad. I normally just have tap water with my food but the water here tastes chlorine! It's like drinking diluted bleach. I don't know why the water tastes so bad here because everywhere else in Toronto the water quality is good. I think Salad King should look into this because it really brings down the food experience. \nBecause of the poor water quality I rate them 3 stars, although food alone would get 5 stars.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	NZPoW7bv_62nAJ-yXpVl1g	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

JRr-wD6HeQPeVKHcDJ0jSw	5	2011-03-10 00:00:00	Salad King is one of my favourite restaurants in Toronto, perhaps even the world. I'm so glad they've finally reopened. Delicious food, low prices (not fast-food-low but not too far off either), fast service, what more could a guy ask for? \n\nThe food is just as good as it always has been. Perhaps the portions were a bit smaller but still fair sized. When I went the place was packed with a line-up of about 10 people waiting but when I left the line-up was all the way down the stairs. \n\nSkip the cliché Pad Thai, you can get that anywhere. I personally have three favourite dishes at Salad King. Golden Tofu Curry which is so good I once ordered it twice in the same day, Siam Noodle with chicken and extra broccoli (peanut sauce goodness), and Thai Islamic Noodle which you won't find on the menu but feel free to order it if you like chicken, shrimp, and broccoli in coconut red curry sauce on noodles. \n\nI used to go to Salad King way back in the day when they were still at their old location before they renovated and expanded. When there was no table service, you'd order at the counter and they'd give you a number and call it out when your food was ready. The numbers were never in order and I could rarely understand them when they were called out over a makeshift PA system.

JuDSor8wtBmZrT_pP3ykTA	2	2014-01-26 00:00:00	Too big for their britches.\n\nSalad King used to be amazing. I don't mean last year or the year before, because at that point, they had been on their way to suck-age for a while. I mean that 10 years ago, they were the best place in the city to go and get a bowl of kill-me hot Tom Goong Kai Soup.  And the soup would actually leave me breathless after ordering a 20.The Pad Woon Sen was some of the best I'd had and overall, the value was outstanding.\n\nThen they renovated, and got the communal table thing happening. The value was still decent, but the portions and quality dropped a little. Still, it was they only place that would actually make things hot enough for me, and the food was decent. At least at this point, they could still seat people within a reasonable amount of  time and bring you the right food.\n\nSlowly, the portions became smaller and the quality and value decreased.\n\nAt their current location on Yonge St, the suck-age is immense. I'm sad to say that I don't want to eat here ever again. The last time I tried to visit we waited for 15 minutes and no one even greeted us. They weren't busy. I get that someone may have called in sick, but really? Just say hello and acknowledge that there are people at the door. We ended up walking out.\n\nThe time before that they messed up our order, bringing me food that wasn't even what I ordered (scary, because I always order my food 20, so I pity da fool they brought  my actual food to.) I had to wait 20 minutes for a new order and my boyfriend was already close to finishing his when they brought me the re-do, which wasn't really THAT hot. At least not 20 hot.\n\nThe prices have been raised by almost a third on some items, from what they originally were, which I get-- overhead + inflation and the like, but the quality has been driven so far downhill that I can't justify spending my money there anymore.\n\nSalad King is a place that is a victim of their own success, but they'll probably still turn a profit being close to Ryerson.

A good Thai restaurant east of Spadina in the Downtown Core!  It's a bit of a hike up to Yonge & Dundas, but like I always say: walk there, subway back.  Initially had trouble finding the place as it's not actually on Yonge street but rather a side street. \n\n However, once you locate the restaurant, the magic doesn't end there oh no, but rather at your desk as you consume the food.  Called 20 minutes ahead of time and it was waiting for me when I arrived.  Although I had to ask them for chopsticks while they had included Fork/Spoon in the bag already.  Is it wrong to feel offended when Oriental restaurants assume we can't handle chopsticks?  Argh... stupid westerners!  \n\nSimply a massive portion - aka leftovers for dinner or lunch tomorrow.  $10 with tax.  I would go back definitely.  Although I recommend ordering ahead as it was very busy around lunchtime.	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Em3MTo91nYOBQFBIpiLRuA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
jXF9ARCKVNCQzaIBdiZJJg	3	2016-02-14 00:00:00	The food is really good, BUT it is SO insanely noisy there! The seating situation is really hard to get past. You get to sit immediately beside other people that you do not know, elbow to elbow. There is no room to put your coat. There is a little spot under your seat where you can put your bag, but there is no way a coat can fit there. Some people just tossed their coats on the floor. It was very busy when we went, which added further to the noisy atmosphere. \nWe both really enjoyed our food, but honestly the noise and the lack of appropriate comfortable seating is what might deter me from returning.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	klb1-LsZlSlBEEjn2rNZcQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

KezVfxus6o5sZorZerMK4A	2	2015-07-08 00:00:00	Salad King is like the McDonald's of Thai Food in Toronto. It's in a super convenient spot, great for RU students to swing by and eat in a loud environment. Been here a few times solely out of convenience and having a quick bite before classes/exams.\n\nOrdered Pad Thai on several occasions, and it's okay. It lacks real pad thai flavour. Tom yum soup - avoid unless you like having water with tom yum base and a small sad slice of a white button mushroom. Bangkok noodles are okay, siam noodles is meh and rainbow chicken wasn't that great, like eating seasoned chicken in water that was meant to be flavourful.\n\n- Food: Inconsistent, but edible. Kind of "meh."\n- Service: Good. Servers are attentive, the rare occasion you might get the one who never shows up afterwards. You know... the one you gotta yell at or wave down.\n- Price: Fair, bit pricey.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	QlIpp1-v_4ZoJJaiZievuw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I got the golden curry with chicken. There were tiny bits of chicken drenched in watery, bland curry. Horrible. The Seafood fried rice tasted very salty and awful as well. The Islamic Noodles were okay but really not good enough to balance out all the other horrid food we got.\n\nOh and everyone is cramped like sardines there.

khscv-bKJQl-STenmSfD5w	3	2016-01-11 00:00:00	When my boyfriend told me we were going to "Salad King", I expected a salad restaurant. What I experienced was much, much better. You have to head up a flight of stairs to the second floor to get to this little hole-in-the-wall, but the climb is worth it. \n\nIt's a very open, clean, and spacious layout here. All of the tables are metal, and the paper menus also double as placemats. You can select the spicyness of your meal via the amount of chilis you have added to your meal. You can apparently go up to 20. I don't want to know what happens if you select 20.\n\nFood wise, imagine McDonald's speed, yet relatively good quality. I was susprirsed how quickly our food arrived betwee ordering, and it being placed down on our table. My boyfriend got their Penang curry soup with white rice, and I got their spicy chicken (standard 2 chili sauce) with white rice. It came served in a very liquidy red sauce, and I was skeptical that it would be good; I was wrong! I cleared my whole plate, and left very full, and very happy. \n\nIf you're in the mood for some fast Thai food, check this place out. If you want a more relaxed sit-down experience, you may want to go elsewhere. This isn't the kind of place where you sit down and chat with friends for an hour and a half; you sit down, order your food, demolish it, and head out.	1	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	g8wFjvr8UwQEhueyX6WHfw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I have worked in restaurants all my life and still do and I just feel a simple modification as switching the kind of chicken breast should be ok ( I just wanted to switch to a breaded chicken breaks as I have been craving it all day) and I was just told no, would have been nice to at least ask the kitchen first as it is a very simple modification. I did offer to pay any extra charge. \nBasically don't expect them to try to accommodate you too much.

I believe all meals are under $10, including steamed rice.\n\nThey have a heat-scale of mild or medium, then 1, 3, 5, 10, or 20 chilies.  I only ordered my dish as "3 chilies" one time and found it to be quite hot.  I believe there might be some inconsistencies with the heat-scale, since some other reviewers have said that their 3 chili dish was not hot, but maybe it was just me.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	bPQMtrXUy8dMCJu6SHxxaA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

kQ46kYtg9CsGPmSfPEdFpA	4	2013-09-26 00:00:00	I recently visited their new location and the food is still tasty. The set-up is kind of tight and the volume is very loud so you either are forced to overhear conversations of parties seated next to you or to speak up so that your dinner companion can hear what you are saying. Good place if you are going on a date but do not wish to have awkward silence when you run out of things to say if there are no sparks or connection!\n\nI am a big fan of their food. I've had their seafood tom yum noodle soup and their chicken mushroom tum yum soup - both were delicious.  The pad thai looks pretty good as well as the other vegetable/chicken spicy rainbow dish that my friend ordered. I have yet to try their other dishes to see if they are the same as what i can remember from back in the day at the old location.\n\nThe food is fresh and everything comes out piping hot. The tom yum is as authentic as I can make out. \n\nThe service is fast and the food comes out fresh & piping hot.  With the amount of turnover, the food is always fresh.\n\nMy usual favorite is green chicken curry but I didn't get a chance to try this out yet. I also have yet to taste the pad thai. \n\nPrices are reasonable. Dishes are around $7-8. They also serve you water but they take awhile to refill your cup & stop refilling after they see you've finished your food.\n\nOverall this place is reliable and de-li-cious. I find it better than spring rolls and East on Queen.	2	0	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	H3tbSSoX5FbCyKxl4Fu6gA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Prices are reasonable. Food is pretty average but always tasty. You can pick your heat level but I personally don't find it spicy enough.

kx2akkSNoek-OEFt_yvwJg	5	2015-08-18 00:00:00	Honestly, the only Thai food I really had up until a few weeks ago was dishes from Thai Express. But after having Salad King, I don't know if I can go to any other place for quick and reasonably priced Thai food.\n\nSalad King is considered a staple for authentic Thai cuisine for Torontonians for the past 20 years. They are known for good service, quality Thai selections, and reasonable prices. Their menu is comprised of a lot of common dishes you would see on a menu if you were to go to a restaurant in Thailand. Customers can choose from dishes varying from Pad Thai to Thai Fried Rice to Curry all the way to Tom Yum Soup. But, there is the Secret Menu option that customers can select, which is their Islamic Noodles. It was one of the best dishes I have ever had in my life. It was an amazing balance between lightly pan fried noodles with chicken with a Panang curry sauce which goes very nicely with the al dente noodles and dense vegetables.\n\nOverall, I am blown away by the flavors in the dishes they serve here. I definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for a great restaurant with good service and bold flavours.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	MxY_ArQomVBNKPIt2FtgyQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

At the old location, I usually did take-out since the place is usually packed.  Since I've been out of school for a long time, I'm not use to sitting shoulder-to-shoulder with strangers for a meal that isn't fast food or cafeteria. This of course means you cannot have a private conversation since people around you are "part of the conversation". \n\nIt seems like the prices have gone up and the portion size is smaller.  I remember when it was cheap and large portions (the reason for being popular with students). Now the prices and portion size is comparable to other Thai places. \n\nFor that reason, I wouldn't mind ordering take-out (3 stars).

lELHJOufmc8XuxN53y8rBQ	3	2016-02-11 00:00:00	My first experience with Salad King was just last evening and it lasted about 25 minutes.  3 fellow Yelpers who I know had checked in just minutes before and since I was in the area I thought I would surprise them by just popping in and invading their space.  Oh wait hey, since I'm here let's get something quick to eat as well.\n\nThey serve food pretty fast here.  My friends' food had already come to the table and I've barely taken my jacket off.  I had ordered a quick chicken phud thai and I was assured by one of my friends that it would come quickly.  Perhaps not even 5 minutes went by and the food was in front of me.  I had asked for "5" chili level of hot.  5 being considered medium.  \n\nThis level of heat was much lower than I'm used to to the point I wish I had one of those little pepper dispensers to add some heat but our table didn't have one but there was one behind us but I didn't notice it until afterwards.\n\nThe noodles were of a decent portion size and the food was ok.  The chicken wasn't too generous but overall the dish was fine.  I would have liked to have had it hotter but now I know for next time.  After tax the bill came out to just over 11 bucks.  Not that expensive for a quick dinner.\n\nThe other meals my friends had looked look decent and while this place is practically fast food it's still a sit down place and it looked pretty busy.  In the end the food is decent, and it's not that expensive and the service seemed quick... this is why the experience only lasted a good 25 minutes and we even sat and rested for a little bit of time too before leaving.	8	5	6	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	65yB0ydGXOZ_-T6J_GbKfw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
LfJg2X7ST5ttl8s05B-P5Q	4	2012-03-20 00:00:00	I come to Salad King once in a blue moon because I know the food isn't especially healthy, but I am always very happy with what I order and the service that comes with it.\n\nI went in yesterday for vegetarian pad thai (which they list as phud thai; potato, potahto) with extra tofu ($1.50 extra but worth it), and received it in under 5 minutes. The spice level perfectly matched my 1 chili order. It was steaming hot and delicious, and served with a lime, fresh cilantro, chopped peanuts, and enough noodles to serve one and a half of me.\n\nMy server was fantastic, and I've actually never had bad service here. He stopped a couple of times to make sure I had everything I needed.\n\nI really like the atmosphere but it is definitely not suited for reading alone. It is very loud during the lunch rush because it's so popular. Even so, I have never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a spot to sit. Be prepared to potentially get friendly with strangers, as the long tables mean that you could be seated next to someone you don't know. This, along with the colourful decor, is all part of the experience.\n\nA couple of tips: If you use the basket under your seat, don't forget  what you put in there when you leave! And of course, check out the washrooms. They're pretty great.	0	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	dzXv2ojcuymuNsLFQ00Niw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Ordered a Papaya Salad and was not impressed. Street Noodle Soup was really good. They have different degrees of hotness. The menu/waitress exaggerates how hot their food is. Hot Thai Noodles were good too. Good portions for the entrees. Wait staff is friendly, but impatient (probably due to high business volume). Restaurant is loud, but not noisy.	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	etyfHfcP-CffyVZj23Supw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I've spent my fair share downtown and when I need my pad Thai fix, salad King is there for me. \n\nPrices are fair for portion and quality. Also it's a fairly big space which is good considering this place's popularity. Not everyone is a fan of the cafeteria-style sitting on long tables and benches. So if you value your personal space, this might not be your style. I don't mind, since the service and food come prompt and I know I can be in and out rather quickly. \n\nBonus points for them having some serious spice skills and options for anyone from mild to downright suicidal level spice!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	OtqdOQ2cwOsO5xwTeBxlsw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I wasn't sure if I could get Thai food that would taste as good (be as similar as?) as it does back home (Portland, Oregon), but I did.  I was very happy with it.\n\nThere were a couple things that seemed like small missteps to me, but not being in the area long enough, some of it may have just been regional.

I walked up to the take out counter.  The lady said "Take Out?  I can't do it. We are too busy."   What?  It's 12:10pm.  I had people calling at 10:30am for takeout.

lQu2A6VawjYJxrtEJolLvA	4	2011-06-27 00:00:00	This restaurant was fantastic. I'm so glad I got a chance to try it. It's a must for everyone at some point.\n\nThere is something incredibly intimate and wonderful about sitting hip to hip with a complete stranger on either side of you. The mess hall style seating just really does it for me. The food is good but it's also cheap and extremely large portions.\n\nMy two cents on this place are about the chili rating. I like spice and can handle a moderate amount but after reading the reviews on this site I opted for just 3 thinking it would be quite spicy...mistake. Next time I would definitely go with 5 to 7 chilies. They're spicy but far from burn your mouth you can't handle it spicy. The Hot and Sour Mushroom soup on the other hand, now that's spicy!\n\nThai Basil Noodles are where it's at (better than the Bangkok Stir Fry).\n\nCheck this place out...you'll LOVE the atmosphere.\n\n**EDIT: Came back here and tried the Thai Basil Noodles (still delicious) with 7 chilies this time. It was way too spciy to eat around friends. That kind of spice should be enjoyed in privacy. I think I'll stick with 5 chilies from here on out unless I'm getting take-out for one.***	2	1	3	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	rK4I1CJLXCQSZIhigdJcnQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It was like the Harvey's of Thai food - you know it's nothing special, but you feel like it is compared to the other fast food options available. Nevertheless, I wouldn't compromise. Service is frazzled by the hordes of people sitting at communal tables in a large fancied-up cafeteria, where conversation is lost in the hubbub and the food is not good enough for silent contemplative enjoyment.\n\nIt's not too expensive - standard prices around $10 - but I would advise anyone who is picky about their pad thai (as I admittedly am) to venture elsewhere.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Zpk_NpxZ767LP3Zlw87y9w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

After spending 4 months in Thailand last year I have missed green papaya salad as many establishments here don't have it on the menu. I was excited to see it here and ordered it. Bland bland bland. The "panang" is soupy and more of a red curry with bizarre textured chicken and overcooked rice.

LTZ6P99PqTbWMh4LMSPJBA	5	2011-02-20 00:00:00	"Excuse me, do you need some more water? I warned you 7 Chilis would be VERY spicy!!!"\n\n"No, actually...these are tears of joy."\n\nI really did cry a little bit (and GASP) upon discovering the lights ON at Salad King today. Clearly, it was God's master plan for me to have this FTR. (Thank you, God)\n\nI quickly dashed across Yonge St and climbed the stairs (but they have a swanky elevator too!) to Salad King's new 2nd floor location on the west side of Yonge. \n\nMy face was beaming. The new space is beautiful. Nice decor, HUGE, with a good mix of the large communal dining tables and tables for a party of 4. \n\nI was seated promptly and did a quick count - looks like enough seating for around 170 diners. Nice, they will need all of those seats to feed cheap delicious Thai food to the masses.\n\nWhile I perused the menu, people were frantically calling their friends to tell them the news. "It's open, OMG, get down here!!!"\n\nThe menu looks pretty much like the old location (no need to mess with a good thing) - numerous Thai curries, Thai soups, mango salad, meat dishes, seafood dishes, tofu dishes, fried rice and stir fry noodles. A few apps and a couple desserts. \n\nI went for the Street Noodle Soup at Chili Level 7. For those of you unfamiliar with the old Salad King - you can select from Level 1-20 Chili/spiciness. I'm told anyone rarely orders anything over a 10 though. (I'm totally trying 10 next time - but I'm a very advanced spice guru and although Level 7 burned my lips, I need more!)\n\nThey weren't messing around in the kitchen OR with the waitstaff. They had a good 2 dozen servers and the food was brought out FAST and it was spot-on delicious. My soup had a really nice homemade look, unlike the fluorescent looking Thai soups they serve up at lots of crappy Thai  food joints.\n\nConsidering they had just opened ONE HOUR prior to me arriving, this is an awesome sign that the service and food quality at the new Salad King location is going to be A++. I'd say they have been practicing for the opening.\n\nPrices are still great - not a single menu item over $10\n\nHallelujah.	16	17	14	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	TbhyP24zYZqZ2VJZgu1wrg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I like their idea of the spicy scale, having a choice of 1,3,5,10,15, and 20 chilis put into your dish.\n\nThe service was pretty fast, and the staff were friendly. The food pricing is also affordable, having most or all choices under $10.\n\nI would love to return and try out a 15 chilis dish next time!	0	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	aAwsWElirUAYHT9nYkRxzQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

We thought she was a customer or student walking out the door after a meal.\n\nThe upstairs was not a bright  clean communal lunch hall feel like the downstairs, but rather like a dim red mood resto feel with group table arrangement.\n\nI did something I regret.  I ordered the Basil Beef here as I looked and dissect it while enjoying the Hot & Sour Shrimp Soup.  I was feeling for SOUP warm soup so I ordered my soup and wanted Noodle Soup too and the waiter looked surprised, I do tend to think untraditional methodology at times.\n\nHe was friendly enough to say that the Soup was similar to Noodle Soup so I asked him to choose an item for me.  I told him I wanted Rice and Beef, and he said Basil Beef and whats better than one of my all time favourites right??  WRONG!\n\nIt came looking all SOUPY, all the Vegetables were boiled rather than sweated or stir-fry which DID make it a healthy chose but it lost all the INTENSE flavours of the dish.\n\nThe Beef was over-boiled and tough as if I was a COW chewing Grass except I am not a cow and do not like chewing tough TASTELESS Beef slices.\n\nThe steam rice that came with the Basil Beef was CLUMPY?  How can an Electric Rice Cooker screw up rice?\n\nMy friends Pad Thai and Fried Rice wasn't much better but at least what they have going for them is a good VALUE.  FYI, the services spoke Cantonese so maybe I can make better relations with them next time and find something BETTER to eat.	2	2	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Wu0yySWcHQ5tZ_59HNiamg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I wasn't greeted by a washroom attendant -no- but instead, a very perky and very happy cockroach. Heeeeyyyyyyy. I (audibly) yelped, and then (mentally) planned to Yelp, and then scurried the hell out of there. \n\nWas surprised by the manager's response- as all he replied was, "Ohhh... shoot. Sorry about that." and turned away to continue tending to another diner. \n\nSorry what?\n\nThere's a half-beaten, half-alive c o c k r o a c h -who can very well survive a nuclear BOMB- sitting in your lavatory, and you're just going to let it have a late check out?

The good man happened to be on a connection flight to New York (from Newfoundland), and let me know he had made this connection JUST so he can have the Golden Panang curry! My companion and I ordered 2 of the Panang, along with the Chicken Coco Milk soup and spring rolls. Needless to say the curry tasted amazing, and for the price, I definitely was not complaining about the portion.\nIn a nutshell, definitely give Salad King a try. Don't go in a group unless you want to wait or make reservations for the second floor.	3	1	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	t2O6rs4fZeY9o6ZY52RyJA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Tofu dishes are almost all deep fried, and the one I had with coconut curry was not terribly inspired: no strong flavours of basil or coriander or other spicing to speak of and largely an overly rich and somewhat heavy curry.  I believe that a simple healthier approach with quality ingredients and spicing could still be done at these cheap prices, but then I guess with lineups assured no real incentive to change.	2	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	AnlHgsmLwYAZ0KeVLbbfQg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

We were extremely happy with out choice. The sauce was a peanut and coconut milk combination straight from heaven. The dish was the perfect amount of spicy. My friend wasn't too excited by the chicken but the sauce was too yummy to complain about. We topped the meal of with the mango and sticky rice which was absolutely divine. \n\nHowever, the evening took a turn for the crappy when they started cleaning up the restaurant and putting chairs up on tables around as as we were still eating out meal. We weren't notified that the restaurant was closed and the staff was quite rude about the whole thing. \n\nI would still go back as the food was great but I wouldn't go there to have a nice long meal. Maybe even do takeout to avoid the rude staff.	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	BytRWk8X1OelSgwwfXd8Aw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It all came down to where you could get the best of the simplest dish - Thai fried rice, and Salad king won out in this regards. Décor is simple and clean at salad king if you decide to eat in and the servers are friendly.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	AqBovt4yeqkmg65T_4qbnA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Depending on the cook, sometimes you get lots of sauce, and sometimes just enough. \nWhen you order chilis for spice, remember they can vary. I've ordered a 5 that felt like a 4 or 3, and sometimes it felt like a 6 or 7. \nThey are usually very quick, even though they can be very busy from the lunch crowd. Coming at 3pm is a good time to avoid the lunch and dinner crowd.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	X1lIJTJqjGUS1jYD52Zw4A	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

MpOQBWJUDPbakC2u9CaCqQ	2	2016-05-22 00:00:00	I had not been back to Salad King for a couple of years and was craving the hot Thai noodles and so we made the trek downtown and arrived around 5pm.  Luckily we did not have to wait at all for seats and so I thought it's my lucky day.  The server sat us at a non kid friendly table which was not a good thing and when u sit four people around a tiny square table it sets things up to be a disaster.  The servers were quick in dropping off the water and refilling, but the plastic cups just made it seem cheap.\n\nWe ordered spring rolls, hot Thai noodles and the green curry.  The spring rolls came out right away as they probably had been cooked a while ago and warmed they were ok but would have been better if it was actually hot.\n\nThe hot Thai noodles came out along with the green chicken curry shortly after.  The hot Thai noodles were just as a remembered and tasted so good with the mix of noodles, veggies and chicken.  The noodles may have been a tad over cooked, but you can't win them all.  The green curry with chicken was just so so and I have had way better at Little Bangkok so was not overly impressed with it.  We had to order the mango chicken and the dish came out looking more like mango soup.  It tastes all right and passable but would not order again as it was sloppily put together.  \n\nThe worst part of the experience were there restrooms.  Enough said.\n\nThe reason I gave them a two is because the hot Thai noodle there is decent.  I probably will not be making this trip downtown again not for what we got today.  Very disappointed in the food quality.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	rurQJvRVdnBSMXM5wC-0zw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Yes, I felt bad about the old place, and the owners had to rebuild.  They did a nice job on the decor.  However, the pad thai is mediocre at best.  I suppose the portion sizes are what keeps the regulars coming back?  The chili scale has always been a draw as well.  Service was quite disappointing.  We were trying to order as another server rudely interrupted and passed on her tables to our server in the MIDST of us speaking!  The servers had a full on conversation!  Rude.  Still looking for a half decent pad thai in the city (Sukhothai/Khao San Road would be the best so far, imho.)  Definitely don't need to go back.  Lots of people there doesn't make it THE place to be.	0	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	rGd8YUtvhSdMm8-9cMdQ4Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The first time, I got the pad thai noodles and it was really good but I do not regularly eat peanuts, it does blend in well with the noodles though. I noticed how small the spaces were but it did hold a lot of people. The second time, I got their islamic noodles (part of their secret menu) and it was ok but was not it a big fan of it as there was too much coconut milk in it and my friends agreed as well. It's a good spot for Ryerson students but I do not think I will be coming back only during times where I catch up with friends.	0	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	0IwZb1ePNpSVYcCdMtGoQw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
mT_vrIVa9GI2ozhUFf_aCg	5	2017-01-22 00:00:00	Holy mother of goodness, how have I never been here until now?! I always walked by and thought it was salad because of the name and was like "it'll be a cold day in hell before I pay for a basic bitch salad when I make my own everyday" but after being informed of the bomb Thai food and the secret menu with the Islamic dish.... I had to. I had to, ok! Its a 4 minute walk from my office.. which means it's a dangerous place because I'll literally be here all the damn time. \n\nPlace was packed. No resos on Friday. Waited 15 min or so for a table for 3 during lunch rush, wasn't too bad. The place is huuuuge - stretches out to communal tables in the back, which is good for when you have one or two people and don't mind sitting wherever. Food comes out super fast too, especially considering how many people there are. Service was super great and didn't lack according to how many people they were dealing with.\n\nThe food was super duper. They had a whole section for vegans/vegetarians and it was great. i had the panang curry with tofu and rice and omg, it was so delicious. I'm having flashbacks on it already. Saucy rice is definitely my thing - I'm a carb queen, you see. You can choose the amount of spice in each dish, but according to my coworkers, it's super inconsistent. \n\nI wanted to try the mango sticky rice dessert because it's one of the classics, but was too full for anything. Nom, it was soo delish though. This is definitely my new spot.	4	6	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	JesJ-LaNfr3pKhL7gWhDrw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It's a meal by itself. So is the Penang , as the server said you can never go wrong with it. She was right!!!  And the price is well worth it!!  But you will have to make plans ahead and willing to wait coz the place was packed but we didn't wait that long and the servers were quite nice to us on our request to sit beside each other... We were placed in the express section. When this happens be prepared to sit across your friend and beside a total stranger.

mXJv5vEGWtS-_x6DlTU5cg	1	2015-11-21 00:00:00	I would have this place less than 1 star if I could. By far, worst salad dishes I've ever had the displeasure of trying. Both the mango and papaya salad were so badly bad that it was mind blowing-its in your name! How one can mess salad up is beyond comprehension (may I suggest taking a bit of time and googling any recipe or put in just a bit of effort into what you are serving). The dressing of the salads tasted of bad artificial lemon/lime concoction drizzled on straight up. The price paid was appalling was such lack of care and quality put into the food. The noodle and other offerings were less than memorable....put it that way, I've had better tasting food at Thai express-sad part is that's not even an exaggeration...the food really depict the lack of care or even respect towards their patron....worse slap in the face ever when you realize you have to pay downtown price for sub-par bottom of the barrow scraps. Can't remember the last time I've tried a place only to bang my head regretting my decision to pass up MacDonald's...	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	F8I0FAZxzWJjcLoajsYK3Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
MXxvqmnO6JcLVAE0uGUbSw	2	2013-04-08 00:00:00	This is one spot where reviews don't matter. They will get packed day after day regardless of people's opinion.\nThe place was just slammed and we had to wait a bit. \nThe noise is deafening BTW and one gets fatigued by just sitting there for a bit.\nThe menu is extensive and covers all the mainstream thai items and then some. \nThey do substitutions which is a good thing  if you are in with a picky eater.\nWe decided on the following\nManago Salad\nChicken Satay\nPanang Chicken\nBeef with Lime Leaf\nThai Noodle Soup (Whatever that means)\nI decided to kick up the spice level on the beef to 15 chilis.\nThe food arrived promptly. The Satay chicken was cooked well, sadly the sauce was devoid of taste.\nMango Salad was supposed to have a green mango as the main ingredient. They served a ripe one. The dressing was a mess IMO. Not balanced at all no tang whatsoever.\nI didn't try the panang chicken or the soup. \nBeef was a disaster. The quality of beef was not good just thin sliced veiled with below average sauce. I mean there is an abundance of good quality of Beef in North America so why skimp. The heat was kicked up by just slathering it with chilli sauce (which was not thai to begin with) the result was one gets a mouth numbing heat at the start instead of the lingering heat that is the signature of thai food.\nPrices here are reasonable. The food is a tad better than  a food court offering.	2	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	gwIqbXEXijQNgdESVc07hg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The prices are extremely reasonable, their portions are quite large, however, they have shrunk from when i'd eat there over a year ago. Flavour is pretty good, just wish the meat quality was better.

MEH.\n\nFirstly, yes, the food tastes good. Credit must be given. However, it falls short in other important aspects. I probably would come back to this place if I had to, but not with much excitement.\n\nOk to dispel the false rumors,  this place is not really that good of a good deal or value. I had a salad and a typical dish, and my bill cams to $18. Not exactly your budget or student diner as others have claimed.\n\nThen there is the place itself. It is super loud. With each bite, you have to mumble serenity now serenity now serenity now and you might keep your sanity. But definitely bring your first dates here, it will give you an instant idea how sexy they are when yelling at you, in case you are curious.\n\nNow for the decor and seating. The joint looks hip for sure, but what's with the cafeteria seating? This arrangement is clearly deliberate since it doesn't seem like they were shy about spending money on interior design. Whatever the reason, it is not really that pleasant. Others may disagree.\n\nOverall, an average experience, and even slightly over priced. I prefer the ma and pa Thai restaurants you can easily find elsewhere.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	8P4GO86Xk3H7lVxERfO6GQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

My friends got the chicken fried rice, good with pieces of fried chicken that came with it, and the basil noodles, which were more plain, and I would definitely recommend the Islam noodles if you were going to do noodles. \n\nService was decent and food came fresh.

Nm5889XzSYLfygpbh6Y46A	3	2014-10-01 00:00:00	10 years ago, when I went to Ryerson, I used to eat at Salad King at least once a week. It was truly an addiction at one point, testing out the 10, 15, and 20 chilly dishes. You actually feel drunk when eating that many chillies! Salad King at one point could do no wrong. The lime leaf chicken was my go-to dish. The green vegetable curry was tops in the city. The cashew nut chicken left me always wanting more. The price was excellent and the place always jam packed. \n\nThen the fire happened, they switched to the new, bigger location, and quality went down. I think the ingredients they use are cheaper and way they operate, it's meant to get you in and out as fast as possible. The service is really quick, but you always get the sense that they are rushing you so that the next group of customers can come in and give them their money. \n\nSalad King got it's reputation as the best thai food in the city back in the day for a reason. But it's a shell of its former self. I rarely return here anymore, as it's got the fast food feel and the food just isn't the same, but will always have great memories of the university days, where Ryerson students were lucky to have such a gem on campus.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	2w-OSuSLDfuIKKwDr800YQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

When we ask for fork, spoons and chop sticks for our take out food. She said for us to go to the front counter to get it = so lazy. She did this right after we finished tipping her. I would not tip if I were to go eat here again if I am very desperate to come back. We even complained the the manager which didn't seem to care. He just said sorry and gave us our spoon, fork and chopsticks. He didn't even ask who the server is to investigate and talk to her after for coaching. This place is just too packed & busy. So not worth tipping here and I would not come back. Maybe I would only order take out and quickly leave if I am desperate to eat here again.

Once I relocated permanently to Toronto, I never visited back. It was a great experience, time to soak up other Toronto adventures. Then came the fire. Then came the re-build. Then I finally returned. Yesterday.\n\nIts new location is a modern, trendy, large space. Its rustic charm has been replaced by shiny, clean, fast service. It appeals to the student base nearby and the tourists congregating in nearby Dundas Square.\n\nMy group ordered pad thai, shrimp delight, and chicken cashew that I can recall. I ordered the chicken cashew, 5 chili spice ranking. It was....bland. It could have benefited from 5 more chili rankings.  \n\nWhile my group enjoyed their respective meals, I could not help but think my memory of Salad King is now tainted with the reality of bad food. My challenge now, is to find a better Thai restaurant!	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	--Qh8yKWAvIP4V4K8ZPfHA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The chairs have little baskets underneath for your belongings. \n\nThe food is decent, typical noodle/rice dishes with meats.

Here's my top 7 reasons. =)\n\n1) It's fast\n2) It's cheap\n3) It's consistent (and I mean consistently good)\n4) It's conveniently located (no better asian food around yonge and dundas)\n5) It has become a scale for how spicy foods are.  (Ex., going out for wings, how spicy are these, would you say it's like a 5 or a 10 at salad king?\n6) First time when my friend asked me to go to Salad King (talking about 10 years ago), I wanted to say no.  Cause who wants to go to a reso which serves salad for dinner.  Thank goodness, they served much more than just salad.  Good memories\n7) In Seven words for reason 7, "Order off secret menu - Thai Islamic Noodles"	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	b4Dvi7D0LkrJcyzEsP0w4A	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

They've got pretty awesome restrooms, too.\n\nI've heard that it can get really, really busy at this place. I came early with a friend and there were still a handful of people coming constantly. Most of the business probably comes from the Ryerson University students.\n\nThe part that annoyed me the most when I was there was the service. It took forever for somebody to come and take our order, or even acknowledge us. At the time I came, the restaurant wasn't even half-full, so I didn't understand why it was taking so long. However, after the order was taken, our food came relatively fast. I ordered the Pad Thai, which was delicious. If you don't have a big appetite, then I suggest sharing entrees with someone. Not-so-great service, but a good place for a tasty meal.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	z9-uqwwe6H4a-vzzpQWysg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

OahJwzNEXq2NIBzWVrzSFA	3	2016-11-01 00:00:00	Overall, food was good. The service was not good at all - we were constantly ignored and for some reason, we were given two glasses of water each. We were also informed that we cannot adjust the spiciness level of the khao soi because it was "pre-set" and we were later told that they ran out of khao soi. Interesting. The seating arrangements were not exactly ideal - I wish there were separate tables instead of sharing one long table with a bunch of strangers. We also had to sit on stools with very little room to store our coats, bags, etc. Would I come back again? Maybe as a last resort.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Nq6e5N8bjgD9B46O4va_zA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
obXAeUYsxfF4td1AcGEdqw	4	2016-03-29 00:00:00	Have had a few good experiences here, and this is the type of place where most items look good, the service is pretty fast, and the prices are cheap enough, though I may take a break for a while.\nI always order a curry, be it green, golden, or red. Never fails :) Lovely, coconutty, creamy, with Thai basil. The mix of flavours is lovely. I will have to try the Bangkok stir-fry next time, as a friend had it, and it looked amazing.  I have to say that the rice dishes (the meat/veggies in a long, shallow bowl with a small bowl of rice on the side) are never spectacular. The Rainbow Chicken was fine. The Basil Beef was fine. Nothing spectacular. I will have to order a stir-fry next time, though I'm not sure when I'll be back. \nI was underwhelmed by the mix of lovely peppers in the golden curry, with the unmistakable taste of frozen carrots that come out of a plastic bag in the freezer section at the grocery store. Also, it looked like the curry had been warmed in the microwave, as the sauce at the edges of the bowl had boiled. I suppose when a menu says 'vegetables', it could mean anything, and this place does cater to students, with its communal tables and bench seats with no backs, reasonable prices, loud fluorescent-coloured wallpaper, and noisy trendy atmosphere.\nAs well, the hostess tried to seat us beside the kitchen and did not want us to change seats when I suggested it is really loud.  We chose to sit elsewhere.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	RuE5FbTd6GHhwjZWcHxAnw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I usually go for their flavourful shrimp pad Thai even though it's a little on the dry side. Do not order the wine, it's worse than boxed wine! Their mild has a little kick so opt for that if you're not very comfortable with spice.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Gua5GdTlTWJpovtG7Hdtyg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
Oc9ShpRg1ZFnKqn5gj3xhg	1	2009-10-19 00:00:00	The food here is decent and reasonably priced. The non-existent service here completely ruins the experience for me every time and I do not plan on coming back.  I agree that the evening rush is very hectic but you get cruddy service no matter what time of day. Servers ignore you by if they aren't your server, wait they do that even if they are your server! The last time I was there, we found hair in my friends food (granted that happens in other places as well) and my server gave my food to another customer who had come in about 1/2 hr after my friend & I did. The manager handled both situations well but unless they train their staff better, I can't see myself coming back. The hot dog vendors give me better service.	1	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	8T0gILg7ivnsPsJuZID6ow	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

od970FgfRVTSOPapJMaG6g	4	2014-07-04 00:00:00	I've procrastinated about writing a Salad King review pretty much since I joined Yelp. \n\nWhy? \n\nI don't know. \n\nMost likely, because it seems like everyone and his uncle has visited the King at some point. If you're downtown and hungry, it's one of the few cheap(isn) eats spots around. \n\nProbably, because the place has evolved ever-so-slowly; from dirty, cheap, fabulous hole-in-the-wall slinging excellent Thai food for peanuts just off the Ryerson Campus, to slick, stainless-steel-shared-seating spot overlooking the strip. Fancier location, higher prices, better publicity mean Salad King is no longer one of Toronto's best-kept secrets. \n\nYet the food is still reliably good. While not cheap enough to warrant an undergrad visit, it still beckons me for lunch from my office, and I'll still propose it to friends or to my wife when we're in the area. \n\nVeggie spring rolls are tight, crispy little mores with crunchy-fresh veg. Sold as a tray of 3, you can ask politely for one as a side order. Do this. \n\nNoodle soups are a tad plain compared to the Ramenterias and Pho shacks about town, but filled with fresh veg, seafood and springy noodles they're welcome when I'm under the weather.  \n\nTom Yum is puckeringly sour, and just hot enough without trekking up SK's legendary chill scale. Uncharacteristically, I prefer the Coconut soup; less heat but tonnes of mouthfeel. \n\nMains are variations on a theme: noodles, curries, stir-fries, all subject to the Scale-customize your heat level until you obliterate all other flavours, if you wish-though doing so would be a mistake, especially with the curries, which balance layers of flavour with tender-cooked shrimp or chicken and veggies. \n\nGolden curry is mildest on it's own, but packs an umami wallop, and has the biggest variety of vegetables. Bits of deep-fried tofu are always welcome. The green curry is spicier, and demands a shot of mouthwash before you head back to the office It does get the endorphins going, though. \n\nLate NOW Magazine reviewer Steven Davey praised SK's Pad Thai for it's lack of ketchup. I agree, and endorse these noodles for the generosity of protein and veg; the tofu and scrambled egg components alone rank this dish high. In recent years i discovered their curry version, which combines the best of Singapore rice noodles with standard PT. More savoury and less sweet, it's become a favourite. Now off-menu, the Islamic Noodles are an even better mash-up. Straight-up pad thai with curry sauce. Mind=blown. \n\nI don't usually get excited for stir fries, but single out "Evil Jungle Prince" for its name alone. There's some damn fine caramelized eggplant in there, too. \n\nDrinks? Dessert? Who has room? Or tastebuds, after all those chills?	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	AQ68GdYacVeqqqroAh9eOA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

For some reason, I expected the food to blow me away, especially when you are seated awkwardly at benches, where you can hardly hear any conversation.\n\nWe ordered the thai basil chicken and the Siam noodles. Dishes arrived quickly.\nBoth were way, way too salty and obviously, mass produced. \n\nI won't return again, even though the price seemed like a 'bargain.'

OlcVDtk_zPTtml9CcqGC2A	4	2012-05-15 00:00:00	A few observations about Salad King. \n\n1. Only 2 "salad" items on the menu. I asked the server for an explanation for the name. \n\n2. Communal tables. 2 8-foot stainless steel tables attached lengthwise. You might be sitting with your friends, but you're also sitting with complete strangers. If you don't like people, stay away.\n\n3. "Mild" doesn't exist. It's on the menu, but it's just for comic relief. If you can't stand minimal spice, don't eat here. On the other hand, no one will say Salad King is bland. \n\nI went last night on my wife's recommendation, and it was a really fun experience, aided by some luck. I was seated next to some really fun, outgoing people, and I love that. Laughter ensued. The artwork and overall design of the restaurant is fun, modern, appealing, and edgy. I love that politically correct is not invited for dinner. \n\nNow, about the food... again, HOT!! And I ordered my food "mild". Imagine "20 chilis?" Just thinking about it makes my stomach, tongue, and throat burn. I ordered lemongrass soup with chicken - a dish I have enjoyed many times in other restaurants, but gave up after 2 half spoonfuls, choking, and tears. I couldn't. Thankfully, the server put me out of my misery, and my table-mates were very sweet about the incident. For a main, I had their green curry which, while still hot, was definitely edible... definitely tasty. I quite enjoyed it. To give you a taste of how spicy this meal was, my yummy Stewart's cream soda tasted nothing like what it always does. \n\nSo, Salad King, your excellent, tasty food and incredible atmosphere has made me a fan. I don't often agree with my wife, but she got this one right, and Salad King has a new fan. Yay.	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ZQ6SaWr3BS6YRNZp8A305A	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
oMvjZeXwl_axfz-ZZd-m3Q	1	2013-09-19 00:00:00	Here is the question I pose to Salad King: do you use canned mushrooms in your dishes because you don't take any pride in your cooking, or is it because you don't respect our intelligence?\n\nCanned corn as well. And frozen peas. Is it really too much to ask for fresh vegetables?\n\nThere are literally dozens of other Asian restaurants on the Yonge strip that are able to pass this meager benchmark of competency. Avoid the lazy cuisine of Salad King and try one of them instead.	0	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	DKSEaXwsyOiWkMnkyHRnEw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
Ooloc3x9LUWjQJiQSeE_3g	3	2011-08-21 00:00:00	I've been here twice now and I must say the hype is well just hype. other than the location, there aren't many outstanding characteristics that make this business stand out against the crowd.\n\nThe food:\nI found that the food was good but nothing spectacular, and with the prices creeping its going to start losing group to other options around town. Their definition of spicy is fairly good as I usually get an order of 10 -15 chilies. =) \n\nI like that they have a diverse menu, but as my girlfriend and I found, the quality varies between good and half decent. They know how to make soup based curries especially with coconut milk, but their handling of stir fry based dishes left much of the food over cooked.\n\nOverall 1.5 stars\n\nThe service:\nTheir wait staff is like their food, some are good some are decent. First time around we had a good server who was patient and kept an eye on our dining experience during a busy dinner rush (kudos to him). However, on the second visit, the server wasn't as attentive to the table leaving us waiting for service. \n\nOverall 1.5 stars \n\nWould come here again if I was in the mood for thai and unwilling to make my way to khao san road. Hype was unfortunately just hype.\n\n+0.5 stars for the communal table design, I'm a fan!	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	bPUpO-bP6BmAGvSwPyDsng	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I'm SO tired of them making you stand and wait if your whole party hasn't arrived - even if you insist that they're coming in 3 minutes - they just don't care. \n\nNow, I've been going to Salad King since I was at Ryerson and they were a hole in the wall dive with picnic tables and questionable food preparation methods. I would eat there at LEAST twice a week for a good 4 years of my life. \n\nBut now with their new location and new makeover seems to come with a new snobby attitude. I used to feel like I was being taken care of, now I just feel like they don't care cause they know I'll wait.\n\nI wish they would remember where they came from - friendly staff, humble picnic tables and plastic tablecloths. Because now all there is are cold hard cafeteria benches, refusing to seat guests and a restaurant that is getting a bit too popular for its own good.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	IRZifXidb51Uh-tb17wegg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

If you can handle spice, a good amount of spice is 2, enough to enjoy the meal as well as the level of heat. Anything more than 3 is just not good anymore. Another thing to try is their pad thai too! \nThe only thing I didn't like during my visit was the high noise level...

otLqfoxxwmBOStuP-eIHIA	3	2011-09-01 00:00:00	After having been recommend this place time and time again by several friends in the city, whenever I was looking for some good Thai food, I finally found this little spot situated above Footlocker on Yonge street. From street level I always find this place easy to miss, particularly when you`re standing on the west side of Yonge, but what I find kinda cool about this place is that you get a clear view of the restaurant and its diners if you`re standing on the east side of Yonge. \n\nEnough about location, onto the food...\n\nThe food is alright, especially for the price. There are lots of options, with a variety of levels of spice, which is nice! They offer a good selection of appetizers and soups. I have now been here on two occasions, and each time I ordered the same main dish (the Kari Noodles) and I have come away happy each time. As for their appetizers and soups. I have tried the spring rolls, but they do not measure up to the big and hearty spring rolls I`ve come to enjoy at other Thai locations. The soup here is okay. I`ve tried both the hot and sour soup and the wonton soup, and if I were to go back again I would definitely order the wonton over the hot and sour mushroom soup, because the hot and sour soup tasted too much of coriander, and the mushrooms were not very appealing. The wonton soup had a nice light flavour that satisfied my palate. \n\nWhile this is certainly not the best Thai food I have had in the city, I will be back. I don`t think this place is all it`s cracked up to be, and I would not wait in the long lineups I`ve seen at this place, but if the wait is short and I`m feeling like a quick cheap meal, then this place is A-Ok!	1	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	cLnvs75Bc-dDuP46JCGLZQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It tastes so light and flavourful that I do not realize I have eaten the whole serving.  Spring rolls are crispy and plump with vegetables.  Green mango salad is tart and julienned perfectly so it is almost noodle like to eat.  The chicken cases was good but nothing to sing home about.

oYuWButxg7qVO77O_axXEQ	3	2016-04-27 00:00:00	-- My First Impression -- \n\nThis restaurant was very close to Eaton Centre (2 mins walk from the Yonge Street Entrance). To me, Salad King is a Thai fast food restaurant. It looked like a canteen since all the tables and chairs were made of metal. Everything was so packed and squished together which didn't make me feel too comfortable. In a good way, they maximized the space so they could contain more customers during rush hour. The wait time was very short and the table turnover rate is very high. The place is very loud, it makes it very difficult to chat with your date/friends. However, the waiting time for dishes was longer than expected, which was not compatible with the restaurant operation structure. \n\n-- Food & Drink --\n\nWe ordered two items: \n\n1. Phud Thai with Chicken (medium spicy) $9.75;\n- I liked how the tofu and peanuts blend in well with the rice noodles. The lime made the dish less greasy. \n\n2. Panang Curry with Chicken $9.75;\n- This is a very sweet curry with a strong taste of coconut milk. I cannot find any peanuts in it, and I found the coconut taste too strong and sweet. \n\n-- Overall --\n\nI would come back for their food given that it is so close to Eaton Centre and the price is relatively cheap compare to the other restaurants around this area.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	sMVD60qZso_90mCedCZJ3g	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It was a sad time when I couldn't go to Salad King and get the panang curry or the Bangkok noodles!\n\nI like that they still have the communal table, which makes us somewhat reserved Torontonians talk to each other. It's a neat mix of people in Salad King. \n\nOur server was totally fabulous (shoutout to Jocelyn!) and let us know that the food is spicier than it used to be. For example, I used to order my food with 3 chilli spice, but now I've discovered (with a slightly bruised ego and smaller sense of personal toughness) that I am only able to enjoy medium. sigh.\n\nBUT it was still awesome.

To anyone who is planning on coming here for first, I would recommend them to try any of these two items!!\n\n** Just be careful with the chillies, depending on how much love spicy food anything more than 3 could make you become a dragon.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	9imX0sKYlUSZWZU_jbXS1Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
P0OkR2wINU6CrRKAhRDiKg	3	2010-07-11 00:00:00	While this is by no means a fine dining experience, Salad King definitely serves up some really great Thai food with fresh, quality ingredients, generous portions and a price that can't be beat! \n\nThe Pad Thai is great, I adore the Mango Chicken and when I'm in the mood for curry, their green curry hits the spot. I hate the setup of the restaurant - the long benches are crowded and it's a bit awkward if you try to have a conversation because you are shouting across the table. It's even more crowded in the winter-time since customers have their winter coats, scarves, bags and usually some shopping bags with them and trying to squeeze onto the bench next to someone with all their stuff beside them is a pain. The window seats (for 1-2 people) are the most coveted spots since they are the most private - if you don't mind people on the street walking by and checking out your food!\n\nIt's located steps from the Ryerson campus so it caters well to those on a student budget.

We used to frequent the old location on daily basis - it was my go-to for great Thai food. \n\nThe new location is great and definitely bigger compared to the original location.  Food quality seems to have changed a little bit and the portions sizes have gotten a little smaller.  Nonetheless the food is good and prices are reasonable.  Just beware the noise level, hard to carry a conversation without having to yell.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	yuo7VCfzzs3THyPEI_u1QA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Pricing resents good value when you're on the lookout for affordable, yet good tasting, Thai food.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ms5B9AiJ0ZHJCcV8DqGlEQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The waitress we had (her name is Kasia) was very skilled, sweet, and quick to respond to our various requests. We had a party table of 12 people and we all had a great time. Portions were very generous for the price. Very impressed. Loud-ish ambience but not unbearable.

(I forgot to ask what my friend ordered, whoops!) At first I thought the spicy squid wouldn't have much flavour because it was still so white, but oh was I wrong.  That dish had so much flavour and spice I had to order the Thai iced tea! It was super yummy! I loved how the Thai iced tea was orange in color and it had a bitter taste it to, unlike many other iced teas. We chowed down so fast I didn't get to take any pictures. Overall a great experience and will be coming back whenever I'm downtown.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	8Ib1RXvG8X6Vxb5YhrukYA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

You can spice it all the way up and, as my British mate said, blow your tits off.  It's nice.  Try their off the menu Islamic Noodle as well.  It's like pad thai with red curry pour on top.

PD9AaWNymuUhzOsZiGaS3A	4	2016-01-27 00:00:00	It was my first time at the Salad Kind new location, been at their other old location many years ago.  I was not impressed with their food in the past but they have improved a whole lot since they moved to their current location.  Went there for lunch during a weekday for 12noon and the place was packed by 12:30pm.  Suggest you go right at 12pm or after 1:30pm if you want a seat.  Really hard to have a conversation because the place is loud with the crowd.  Had their veggie pad thai noodles and it was so good!  Everything about the dish was just right!  The following week, I did a take out of the same item but it wasn't as good.  Better to sit in and order.  The food tastes a lot better.  Can't wait to treat my sister here for lunch.  Restaurant was clean and the Staff are really nice and the service was very good.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	8IdqybL0jTs3QXEd5odDgg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
pE8Bel3lV8dAFGzBC-tPcA	4	2015-03-18 00:00:00	The restaurant is always usually very crowded on weekend evenings, and quite possibly every day! \n\nThe tables are very long, so people have to sit side by side, very close to one another. I find this kind of annoying as there isn't much privacy, but what can I do. I just suck it up. Along the back, by the big windows, are more private tables and seats. I think there are a longer line ups for those areas, as many people want privacy as well. \n\nWhen you are seated, your table mat, which is also your menu greets you. As you can see, the restaurant's menu is very long, but that's probably only because it is on one piece of paper rather than the book that we are more used to.\n\nPersonally, we love eating curry, fried rice, and their seafood dishes here. Every time I tried their noodles, I had some difficulty finishing it because it was't up to par with the other dishes.\n\nAside from the menu, you can modify the spiciness to your dish to make it as spicy or non-spicy as you like it to be. In addition to the chilis, you can ask your food to be made gluten-free or vegetarian depending on whether the option is available. Look for the appropriate images beside the menu to see if it's available.\n\nSpicy Mussels:\nThis is one of our favourite seafood dishes. We added 10 chilis to it, which made our waitress raise her eyebrow. :D For us, it was quite spicy, giving our noses a little kick, but it was bearable. Aside from the spice, the dish was full of basic vegetables (onions, carrots, peppers) and the muscles were cooked well. The sauce itself was spicy and sweet... that's all I kind of remember about the dish. Eaten with the rice, it was enjoyable, especially for its price.\n\nPanang curry:\nThis is by far my favourite dish in the restaurant. Golden in colour, the curry is perfect with a bowl of rice. I added a few more chilis to make it a total of 5, and it was perfect for me. The coconut milk that they used in the curry balanced out the spiciness, making it not spicy at all for our tastes. I like panang curry over the other types of curry because it has a bit of every taste in it. Spicy, sweet, and savoury all at the same time... I get all my favourite flavours in one bowl! I've tried many Thai curries from various restaurants, but for some reason, this one at Salad King still remains on my top 5 list. That says a lot!\n\nIf you're looking for a cheap but well tasting Thai restaurant in the area, try Salad King! Make sure to call ahead to make a reservation if you don't want to wait and/or want a private table.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	u4iBXHU_ZCUIXymxkcsHdA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It was supposed to be with a curry sauce but there was no sauce to speak of. It was just dry! \n\nPlus their machines have the option for 15%, 18% and 20% or other. Tip is for good service and they automatically expect 15%?? No way! \n\nService sucked and I won't be returning.

My friend and I ended up getting seats in the middle of the long table so the people sitting on either side of us were literally 1 foot away.  Nevertheless, it was still a good experience.  \n\nThe food was relatively cheap, quick and delicious.  We had the spring rolls, satay chicken, golden curry with beef and phud Thai with chicken.  All the dishes were great, but the phud Thai was excellent.  I couldn't stop eating even though I was full!

The Thai Islandic Noodles (not on the menu downstairs but you can order it anyways) are fantastic.  If you are a peanut sauce fan, then this is the dish.  5 chilli is the max so that you dont ruin the dish.  Its quite interesting as it is cafeteria style seating and always full.  Some of the places they try and sit you, you practically have to crawl over someone when it is packed.  But the food comes quick, the service is good and the bill is low.

PRpfoiV1wd5C6II3LLDq8Q	4	2015-02-10 00:00:00	Salad King has easily become one of my favorite thai restaurants in the GTA! \n\nOne of my friends recommended I try Salad King because I am a huge chili head (I love spicy food). I decided to give it a go.\n\nMy first time going to Salad King, I tried their Shrimp Phud Thai with 20 chili's. The spice was definitely right! And the pad thai tasted delicious. The price is fair and the portions are pretty large.\n\nI've also tried their Islamic Noodles. Not my favorite dish but it definitely has a unique flavor. It kind of reminds me of pad thai, but with a coconut based sauce.\n\nThe layout of this restaurant is quite interesting. Half the restaurant has traditional seating arrangements, whereas the other half has long, communal style tables with stools. Under the stools of these tables are baskets for you to put your belongings (or jacket). To be honest, it's a bit difficult to hold a good conversation in the communal seating area, but it's not a huge drawback (avoid for first dates).\n\nThe service is decent. The server will make sure to come by to get your order, but rarely do they check up on you so you'll need to wave them down for the bill.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend Salad King. They've become my go-to place for pad thai!	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Arf9ddxVvO3PsmdZlPBDyA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

A good first date spot this is not!!\n\nBut what counts, the food, happens to be tasty and reasonably priced. They are also excellent to vegetarians. I've had the bangkok stir fry, kari noodles and golden tofu - good portion sizes and served HOT out of the wok.

The interiors are slick, and still have that magnetic Salad King-esque modernity to them.\n\nBut where they failed to win me this time around was their flavourless Panang curry. With all the great Thai options in the city, the King will have to make their food once again as dynamic as the decor to reign supreme in my books.	3	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Gaj5UjugtJL2aCWO6wmY1Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

We ordered the Thai ice tea, khao soi, and phud Thai. Since my Thai food taste bud has evolved from trying khao San road and pai, I was anticipating salad king not to be as good. To my surprise, it wasn't as bad as I thought. The Thai ice tea wasn't too sweet, but didn't have enough tea flavor, the phud Thai was actually pretty good. Good authentic phud Thai flavouring. Wished there was more chicken in it though. The khao soi wasn't as good as the other restaurants that I mentioned. The chicken was tender, but the curry itself was more watery than flavourful. The total bill came up to $26. Honestly, a steal for 2 people for lunch.

I have always ordered their chicken curry and never been disappointed. The food is good and standard. It is very westernized and not authentic. They are a good choice for those that want to try thai food but are afraid of committing to a more authentic restaurant. Everything on the menu is safe to eat. \n\nThe only cons I've experienced would be the annoying picnic table seating. I don't like being so close to others. Their hot and sour mushroom soup was really bad. Holy moly, it was so spicy I couldn't finish it. It was pretty much spicy water that was inedible. Major disappointment. \nDon't think I'd come here as my first choice thai restaurant, I've only come here because others want to come here.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	sWKaLjpYG6VABf23CXDhyA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
qdfI0GHjJy82Xz836Uc76g	3	2016-05-11 00:00:00	Came here with a friend for dinner around 6pm on a Wednesday evening. The place was half empty when we arrived, but it's known to fill up quickly with the university crowd. \n\nWe were initially going to be seated in the main bench seating area, but the server was nice enough to move us towards the windows when we kindly asked. From past experience, sitting in the bench seating area can get cramped, loud and a bit uncomfortable if you're hoping to have a private conversation (read: if you're getting to know someone on a first date while sitting in the main bench area, it can get real awkward real fast).\n\nWe ordered the Islamic Noodles with chicken (a secret menu item I've been wanting to try), and the Siam Fried Rice; both less / non-spicy.\n\nThe Islamic noodles is a pad thai with coconut curry sauce. Sauce was tasty, noodles were good, chicken not overcooked - would definitely order again.\nThe fried rice was your standard fare fried rice mixed with shrimp, squid, pineapple and vegetables. Pineapple and vegetables seemed fresh, but the squid had a strong fishy taste which was a bit odd - not sure if that was intentional or something else going on there. Would likely not order again.\n\nOf the times I've eaten here, the service was always good. I think we spent nearly 1.5 hours  eating and chatting, and never felt rushed even as the busy university student crowd began pouring in later in the evening.\n\nOverall, decent food with good service for a good price.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	VyqUwx-OJ37M6YiO5MVmgQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
qDWLRPG1PYxM-6RRfUUwGg	4	2013-01-22 00:00:00	I like this place for cheap and quick thai food. I live pretty close, so it is convenient. I avoid coming here during lunch time and peak dinner times (the waits can be long then), and mostly come before or after the lunch or dinner rush (no wait), since I hate waiting, also the food here is not worth waiting for.\n\n I like how you can have your food mild to mind blowingly spicy, I love spicy foods but my husband doesn't so this place caters to our individualistic taste. All dishes are generous in size and the prices are very reasonable.  Do not expect to find the most authentic thai food here, but it is tasty so who cares, some times you don't need "authentic" thai to fulfill that craving. My favorite dishes here are Thai Street Noodle Soup and the Lime leaf Beef with 10chillis each.\n\nThe place is cafeteria style so can get quite noisy during the peak periods, service is casual and prompt which is good for this type of place.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	drmTj6FQRWgek_VooTDqZg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

QFpwgpNEWsEY0UJrMEGYhA	4	2016-10-27 00:00:00	This is my favourite casual Thai joint.\n\nNothing fancy, but always clean inside and the seats are comfy, the decor nice, and the servers always friendly and very fast service. Prices not super cheap but reasonable for what you get (the portions are a decent size).\n\nIts always pretty busy but can generally get a table without much of a wait.\n\nHas your standard Thai dishes. My favourites are the islamic noodles (not on the menu), and green curry. I always ask for 3 chilis as even the 2 chili which they say is "hot" is not even mild imo. \n\nOne downfall and the reason for 4 stars and not 5 - the food doesn't always come out piping hot. On more than one occasion it was served luke warm and although the taste was still great, it needs to be hot and steamy for it to be perfect. I think I will request it extra hot (heat wise) in the future and see if they can accommodate.If so they will get 5 stars!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	wky4BZxCELi4PZcvb11qYQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The service is always great and the food is even better.\nI like the fact that the food has always remained consistent throughout the years opposed to other places where it's very hit and miss. \nI recommend trying the Thai Basil noodles, it seems to be the most popular and the best. What you choose for the chilli level is up to you. As for me I usually get the 20 chilli level. \nIf you're ever in the area definitely check them out!	0	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	4LPsIyUQxuQAFOZOUqHvRQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

As alluded to by other yelpers the seating leaves something to be desired, but it's all about managing one's expectations; cafeteria style seating leads to a noisy and busy atmosphere, but if you're just looking for a quick bite and then to be on your way, it's great!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	PsR0t-HLgncEZ1jHmEnaEg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

For less than $10, you get a huge helping of green shell muscles, and are they ever MEATY!  We always chuckle at the Evil Jungle Prince, but have not ventured to try it.  Spring rolls are top notch, as are the appetizer soups (hot and sour mushroom is delicious and leaves you with a dry chili throat).  \n\n5 chilies max for me.  My friend Mike always adds their tabled chili sauce, and then bitches about indigestion all afternoon.	1	7	3	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	y8NVCufGa0ZqpDV2wCbZQg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I enjoyed this place for the most part except I am giving a 3 star review because of a single visit.\n\nI told the waiter that I was allergic to peanuts but I was given a dish with peanuts. I had only noticed after my boss mentioned that there were peanuts in my dish (which I thought were simple cashews). Although my allergies are far less severe compared to 10 years ago, I wanted to avoid peanuts just in case. Now if someone else who had been extremely allergic were to go through this, the outcome would have been much worse. \n\nNonetheless, the food was very good. Here's what I tried:\n1. Green curry: 5/10. This was my first ever dish at salad king and I did not like it. I was reluctant to come back after trying this dish but I finally did and fell in love with their other dishes.\n2. Pineapple chicken: 8/10.This was so good, I have nothing bad to say.\n3. Panang curry: 9/10. This was delicious. I got it with 3 peppers and loved it, even though I normally don't like spicy food.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	sb75BE7UxbtGsw-gMf1NrA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It was kind of awkward though cos when it gets busy, they start to put different couples or groups completely side by side - on the same table since their tables are really long. But at least everything was really cheap!\n\nI had 'Sea Queen' recently, with 3 chilli.

We were looking for a Thai restaurant on Yelp and saw that Salad King got 3.5 stars out of 5, which made us think this can't be a bad place. So we decided to go there for lunch and omggg that was a big mistake!!! We ordered the basic Thai dish: mango salad, tom yum soup & pad thai. I swear I can cook better than this at home. It's not only nothing close to Thai food but also terrible, like we never had such a bad experience like this.

All items are under or around $10, and the quantity is huge (enough for 2 full meals). And the food is simply delicious. Only complaint would be in inconsistency of the chili scale--it's always different every time I order. But the food is so delicious and flavourful that it doesn't matter. My favourite items are the curry dishes (golden is my fave), and the Islamic noodles (no longer mentioned on the menu but you could still order it). I ordered the basil chicken and it wasn't as flavourful as the others, but still good. Def recommend this restaurant.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Lzx978FW-c4WwUBWUmIq1Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The fried rice are all stick together as blocks of white rice, they took away the mussels and leaving only squids which are very hard and uncooked.

Today, I was SO excited for my lunch date with the king. \n\nIt didn't disappoint. Got the emerald curry, big portion, still cheap and still good. The tofu was fried up REAL nice. My friend got the golden curry and demolished it. Approval all around.\n\nI went at 12:45 and there was no wait time, but the place was packed. The new decor is pretty funky, lots of brightly coloured murals celebrating salad king. The interior is definitely larger than before and there are booths now, but sadly I missed out and had to sit at the cafeteria style tables. \n\nAlthough the caf style tables are definitely a 'cool' and 'trendy' concept, and allows them to serve way more people - you have to shout at your lunch or dinner mate in order to be heard. That's the only negative.	2	3	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	VJdemYua1fU6JaDH5Jbu0g	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I'm always in and out in time for whatever I have planned afterward.  The student vibe makes me nostalgic for the good ol' uni days.  It's loud with communal seating, and it doesn't pretend to be anything other than one it is - inexpensive dining striving to move as many customers as possible through the doors.  The green curry is good with anything.  The Phud Thai is a good noodle choice though I've had better.  \n\nA consistent fave:\nGarlic Shrimp served with rice.  Honestly, one of the most surprising dishes at this place.  I had instinctively cringed when I first saw the listing for 'breaded shimp', expecting some heavily done up puny shrimp with an inch of deep fried flour coating each side.  How wrong I was!  What arrived was a generous serving of large shrimp lightly coated in a tangy sauce.  A must try!	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	DNlzbI54zCOa4to-vTWBJQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Solid every time. \n\nDon't bother ordering the Mango Salad. It's dressed with only bottled lemon juice. No signs of chili or fish sauce :( I mean, would it kill someone to squeeze a fresh lime. \n\nThe Pad Thai is just okay. I wish they would use Thai Chili instead of Chili Flakes for heat in this dish. \n\nSea Queen is a favourite. Breaded Calamari with a Sweet/Sour/Spicy dipping sauce. \n\nI was excited for the Sticky Rice/Mango dessert. Totally unsuccessful as the mango wasn't ripe. This should be a seasonal item, and shouldn't be featured on the menu when mango isn't in season.	2	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	PfMDMerIdGet_vDYOV8vDA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
RDcdhbG3FvwOPn5pgHhW6w	3	2017-01-19 00:00:00	I have been here many different occasions and I must say that my experience has always been a bit variable.\n\nThe first time I came here was with my boss and colleagues. My colleague arrived 5 minutes earlier then the rest of us and they refused to seat her until the entire party was here. We made a reservation and the table was ready so I wasn't too clear on why they made her wait, but just be aware of the policy. They WILL NOT seat your party until every single person has arrived, which can be irritating if someone is running particularly late.\n\nAnother time, I went for an early lunch at 11:30am and we were seating effortlessly. Keep in mind that this location fills up very quickly around noon. If you want to beat the lunch crowd I would recommend eating at 11:30, as there were many tables free when we arrived. I have also ordered food from salad king through an app called "Ritual" and have had a very good experience. They sometimes have specials and discounts for ritual members which is nice.\n\nThe food itself is very delicious. It is very customizable. You can change the amount of spiciness and change the meat options to shrimp, chicken or beef. There are also a lot of vegetarian options for those who do not eat meat. Everything is very reasonably priced at around $10-$15. For around $10 you can get a HUGE serving of curry pad thai with a choice of meat. I usually bring home what I can't finish and eat it as a snack later. They also have delicious curries that you can get with a generous amount of white rice. If you are looking for a cheap eat, or if you are working or going to school near dundas square i would recommend trying out salad king	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	iEkVA-Frwvucw5hnKKAPZA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Not too sweet, not too salty. \n\non the ratings scale, our server was sceptical i could handle a 10/20 for spiciness, but i insisted. turns out it wasn't really that spicy. next time i will go for a 15/20. \n\nand i will avoid the lunch hour rush. we waited about 30 mins for our food, and i agree with other reviewers that the bench wasn't comfortable. and our elbow-to-elbow neighbors kept eavesdropping even with the din throughout.	7	3	4	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	lJzgOpVS1pmb2UW7j2GkDg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Salad King in downtown Toronto is a happening place. I went there on a Saturday night and the place was packed.  Our party of 4 had to squeeze into one of the communal tables.  Sitting shoulder to shoulder with strangers really gave us a chance to see what others were eating.\n\nThe food was a little different than what I have become used to.  Instead of shared plates it seemed that everybody was ordering their own meals.  There was also some Asian fusion going on here, so I would not classify this as an authentic Thai restaurant.  As for the taste,  I like it a bit spicier and with more aroma.\n\nSalad King is an interesting experience if you're ever in downtown Toronto and crave a little Thai food.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ciWCKiNXAMiUybOrk8rnqw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

rJX6ws5qbsWTJj198VF6qA	4	2011-05-10 00:00:00	I was really sad when I learned that Salad King burned down last year.  When I found out it was re-opening down the street I was very happy as this is one of my favourite Thai places in Toronto.\n\nMy brother and I dropped in and were stuck behind a large lineup.  We walked to the front to get our name on the waiting list and were lucky that they had a seat for 2 immediately.\n\nIf you've never come here you'll find out quickly that there are a lot of tables but they will seat you side by side with others.  We were added to a table for 6 and it seemed the 4 were not all together.  We sat down and looked around to the new place.  It looks a lot bigger than it did before.\n\nOur server dropped by with menus and some water and we had a quick chat about graffiti.  After looking over the menu we got some skewers, mango salad and I ordered the Golden Curry with Chicken...5 chilli's.  \n\nOur appetizers came out fairly quickly and we started with the mango salad.  I had a gut feeling it was the wrong time to order this and I was right.  The mango's were pretty sour, a lot more sour than I like.\n\nThe skewers were up next and I loved these so much.  The beef was cooked perfectly and the peanut sauce is very good.  A lot of beef skewers I order are usually overcooked, not at Salad King!\n\nIt wasn't long until our mains came out and boy did it look and smell delicious.  I poured some of the curry and other goodness over the rice and I could pick up this amazing smell of all the ingredients.  Upon my first bite it was the same Salad King I had remembered.  The meal was great...and did I mention the price is amazing?\n\nOur server was really friendly and really nice.  I can't wait for my next visit!	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	augJQotyLB503iq1gVJ_tg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

After telling her about the wait and ignorance by the staff.. She starts making excuses about how the girl in the section went on break..( but they were serving the others in my section ?) \nThen she tells me --if i go and sit back down she'll  take it now (she didn't apologize yet) \n\nAfter I told her no it's okay I'm just going to go somewhere else .. She turns around and tells me I'm never welcomed here again.. Lol what ?! \n\nHow are you a manager ?! \n\nNo apologizing nothing -- \n\nmaking excuses that doesn't make sense cause those people served were right next to me in My section \n\nthen you tell a customer they aren't welcome back because they're just letting you know about your poor service ? \n\nSad.

rNDTwjzNps6i1HbwObCKgg	4	2013-11-14 00:00:00	I keep wondering why they named this restaurant Salad King when they actually serve Thai food, but then again that's not really a big issue. The important thing is they make wonderful food, specifically SHRIMP PAD THAI! I keep coming back for this particular dish-- always served hot, fresh and flavourful. Chicken pad thai is good too. The portion is huge, which is why I make sure I'm hungry when I come here.. I've tried some of their curries but I find them ordinary and a bit less exciting, which is why I'm sticking to pad thai whenever I visit. Service is fast and excellent and prices are very reasonable.The place can get really loud and noisy during peak hours, but for me that gives it life and personality. It's fun coming here with friends, but it's perfectly all right dining here alone as well. Salad King has a modern, vibrant and energetic take on Thai food and I'm loving it!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	CXzLTSIPaCllQX2LWCWelg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
Rq35zeAxu1CPfn6cRG1VAw	2	2017-07-22 00:00:00	My friend was in town and was craving Salad King, so we decided to go at lunch time during the week. I headed over early to snag a table. Unfortunately, they don't do this unless almost your whole party has arrived (they wanted 3 of 4 people there). So I stood around awkwardly in the entrance area for 10 minutes and watched other people be seated with a whole pile of empty tables behind me. Weird. \n\nWe sat down and were catching up, so when the server came by once and then twice and we hadn't decided what we wanted, she said to just flag her down when we were ready. We took a while longer and then flagged her down, she nodded at us. And then 10 minutes go by and we had to flag her down again. \n\nI always get the sea queen, it's calamari with a honey lime sauce and rice. Soooo tasty. The calamari is always tender and the sauce is badass. We also got the spring rolls they were huge and quite tasty! \n\nI know Salad King is a super popular spot but it doesn't hold much appeal for me. I dislike the bench seating they have there, I don't like being shoulder to shoulder with strangers while I eat. The food is great but the not so great service and not being able to hold a table while you wait for your party arrives is frustrating. It's also super ridiculously noisy. Like almost yelling across the table to talk noisy. Not a fan!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	vJGLEHyhCs9V-5fAe-xx3w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
rsN7ucwR07mZDxwQiyq8Vw	4	2009-03-24 00:00:00	I'm a lover of all food that is Thai so of course I loved Salad King. It's really cute and set up in a cafeteria style. The service is quite fast and the portions are pretty big. I ordered the pad thai with 5 chillies and it was very spicy but I really liked it.\n\nI took away one star because:\n\n1) the wait times can be quite long\n2) the waiting areas are really tiny \n3) I'm all for personal space; it gets a little uncomfortable sitting right beside a stranger as you eat your meal (b/c they are cafeteria tables)\n4) for a simple place, the prices are comparable to Spring Rolls (a fancier thai place)\n\nBut overall, a great place for a quick meal	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	tkTuABRTU4S9OFN8zIPEtA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
RV6ZE1dzUkRRngEs0lFPCQ	4	2011-09-04 00:00:00	Salad King is one of those places where you can go and get a very fresh meal quickly without any hassle.  The food is cheaper than going to the mall just south of its location and offers (in my opinion) a better selection of balanced meals.\n\nThe clientele that frequent this place are generally students, and considering its proximity to the Ryerson campus, this is no surprise to anybody.  It's often very busy so if you're a party of more than 2, expect to wait for a table during peak times.\n\nThe environment is often very loud so if you're looking for even a moderately quiet place to sit and talk, this is not going to be it.  And while it appears very hectic, the wait staff are very well organized and take good care of you.\n\nDid I mention the food?  The food's great.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	F-ZrLBimEyNvAGaCu1M97w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Service was quick and good; we got the sea queen and golden tofu. Golden tofu was good, as per usual,  but the sea queen was a tad undercooked. The squid didnt have the same texture and the breading was still raw. The pad thai here is also pretty good as well as the othet curries. Still would recommend to anyone in the yonge and dundas area and to anyone who wants an intro to thai food.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	XKFAg7zBFtsRyU_5OVEjWg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
RWMWu_pKMY-jk4smdDiTAg	4	2011-02-25 00:00:00	It's the moment we've all been waiting for: the reopening of Salad King! This day couldn't come any sooner. I remember planning a celebration lunch/dinner after my last final exam of the winter semester, only to arrive at school one day and being informed of the collapse of the Empress Hotel. Since then, I've vowed to be amongst the first to dine once it reopened. (For the record, I missed out on both their soft opening and the official opening, as I went away for a few days).\n\nWe arrived at the new location around 7 PM, with the line leading all the way downstairs, with an estimated 15 to 20 minute wait. Names weren't also going to be taken down, until you finally got upstairs. Fortunately for us, everyone in front of us consisted of parties of 3 or more, so when the hostess called down the line to see if there was a party of 2, we were immediately seated!\n\nI must say, I was quite impressed with what they've done to the place. It closely resembles their former location, with the elbow-to-elbow seating and cafeteria-like layout. I was particularly amused by their seats, which now have a basket for your belongings underneath them, similar to the desks you find in high school.\n\nWe were disappointed to learn that they were out of the Crispy Spring Rolls, and stuck with our main dishes instead. I was about to order the Thai Basil Noodles, but then I remembered the Thai Islamic Noodle, which isn't listed on their regular menu. I was delighted to discover that they do, in fact, still serve this "hidden" menu item. Essentially what it is, is a rice noodle with chicken, shrimp, vegetables, served in a red curry. As expected, it was the same great taste that I've craved for months and can't wait to try my other favourite dishes again. I'll admit, though, that the serving seemed a bit smaller than what I remembered. I'm not sure if it they were downsizing to accommodate for everyone given the demand since opening, but we'll see how it is in future visits.\n\nAs for the spiciness, I originally opted for 10 chilis (out of 20), but our server mentioned some of the feedback regarding their spicy scale, and that customers have commented on the spiciness being a bit spicier than before. I ended up lowering it to 5, and on my personal scale, it was a mild, and next time I'll stick with 10 chilis. To be honest, I think the feedback was primarily due to being deprived from Salad King for months ;)\n\nFor now, I'm going to stick with 4 stars. Once things normalize, I'll revisit this review and make any necessary changes. Other than that, our server, Jamie, was pleasant and delightful, and the water bearers were constantly refilling our water. With this semester being my last at Ryerson, you can definitely count on me dining in or ordering take out plenty of times in the near future :)	3	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	gQ7jvafqJcnCG-ZPGFORmw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Cheap and delicious food. Generous servings and always piping hot. They serve Thai beer, ice cream and teas. The spring rolls and pad Thai are also honorable mentions but for me it's all about those HOT THAI NOODLES with chicken !	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	67Ql9uq3xPBf68tTAJeeVg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
rzbhU_TG3aF0Mg37JOXnzQ	5	2015-05-14 00:00:00	Always my go to Thai place when I'm downtown! Can be easily missed since they have a tiny sign peaking out but it's right across from Ryerson University's new learning centre and in between Champs and Pizza Pizza. \n\nService is always fast and often busy between lunch and dinner hours as expected. They also have really long tables with communal seats side by side so expect to sit next to strangers if you intend to go as a pair. Depending on the time of day, it can get quite loud but the food always hits the spot and leftover noodle stir fry's are my favourite; tastes even better the next day, mmm!\n\nI love trying new things but I can never get myself to order outside of my go to dish which is their panang curry with chicken ($9) and Thai iced tea ($2.75)! The curry is so creamy and rich and pairs even better with their secret menu dish called Islamic noodles which I find myself craving often! Colourful interior, affordable and flavourful food. Definitely the place to be when you're in a hurry and want to eat something quick and go. Fast and friendly service and I guarantee you'll be stuffed!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	odD303vl06bhbAd5NBg-bg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

S7Rxd8SQrF0PIzNRH0pr4Q	3	2015-11-09 00:00:00	Came here on Wednesday night at around 8pm and it was packed. It was surprising because first of all it was a weekday, it was pass dinner time, and it's a restaurant upstairs on second floor. I always stumble upon their posters on the escalator at Dundas station but never thought to try it out because I thought this is some health food place due to its name, so I was equally surprised to find out Salad King is actually a Thai food restaurant. Their menu only featured about 3 salad items lol. \n\nThe environment:\nThe seating arrangement is quite "sad", like you sit in cafeteria style and there's no separation between you and the other people, so the noise level is on the higher end. I was able to get a seat when I was there, but the restaurant was still super packed. \nThe bathroom was a little strange as well, my friend was uncomfortable to use the mixed gender bathroom. Basically everybody enters the same door to use the bathroom, but they do have individual stalls, so you actually only share the hand washing sinks. I was ok with the arrangement but it is something unconventional to see.\n\nThe food:\nThe menu was the sheet of paper that they put on top of the table to avoid getting the surface dirty. The prices were pretty cheap, most of the dishes were under $10. A lot of the options were spicy though, but as someone who don't normally eat spicy food, I think the one chili-level dishes were manageable. \nI ordered the Chicken Phud Tai with no spiciness and it was ok. The noodle was salty and sour and I liked the chewy texture of the rice noodle. The portioned seemed huge but it was mainly noodle, not a lot of chicken and veggies. I only managed to eat half of what was there and packed the rest home. The smell was pretty pungent so I don't suggest anyone to bring it to work and reheat it.  \nI got a taste of my friend's Chicken Coconut Milk Soup (one chili-level) and Mango Coconut Milk Sticky Rice (non-spicy). The soup had an interesting taste, you don't taste the spiciness until the liquid gets to your throat, and eventually you would feel that the soup was indeed pretty spicy. I liked the coconut milk on the sticky rice, but I wish the coconut milk was scrambled with the rice for even flavour, instead of just poured on top of the rice. The mango was fresh but not ripe enough.\n\nThe service:\nYou get an assigned waiter for your table, which I feel is a bad arrangement, because they are always busy and don't have the time to check up on you. We didn't get any benefit from having an assigned waiter, when in fact we literally had to get another waiter to look for our waiter. I wish they could have just done it like Chinese restaurant style, where you can ask any waiter who just so happened to walk by for service. The food was slow too, I think we waited about 15-20mins to get served. \n\nVerdict:\nI personally wouldn't come back here, despite some of my friends claimed to come here at least once each week. Food wasn't outstanding, and I just can't stand the noisy environment and the slow service.	0	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	G-6X-llgA_qAxGxocykHzQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

ScUm-M0m_ATyf8QHviaEmg	4	2016-05-19 00:00:00	So many friends have recommended Salad King, so I was really looking forward to trying it out. I wasn't expecting the crazy, bustling atmosphere, which I attributed to the workday lunch rush, nor the canteen seating. We were a party of two with a party of three next to us. Someone who was eating alone then got placed in the empty seat in the middle, which seemed a bit uncomfortable and cramped. \n\nDespite the large amount of customers, the service was prompt. There seems to be a good operational system in effect. I ordered the Islamic noodles with chicken, which tasted great. The portions were probably double of what I usually eat, so I had plenty of leftovers. I asked for my dish to be made non-spicy, but it still had a tinge of spice, so be cautious if you prefer not to have a spicy meal or have low spice tolerance like me.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the experience, and would definitely come back given its convenient location and affordable food.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	TX5kwQLpKUDvNf4mfdaH3Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

So we drive 45 minutes from Oakville to check the place out and were told there's a small wait. When were taken to our table (which held 4 people), it was one with no back supports and being an Ontarian with a back disability, I was not able to sit in that position for too long so we requested the empty 4 seater booth next to it. The amazingly friendly woman at the front said we had to ask the manager if we were able to sit there, so he comes over acting like he didn't know what was going on and we explain how I had a back problem and JASON told us we were not able to sit at the open booth. My jaw dropped and we decided to leave. Nowhere else in Canada would this ever happen. We were politely told to screw off because of my disability.

I decided to try out Salad King as I know it has been around for a while, and had heard great reviews back when I was in undergrad. I ordered the yellow curry, and it was by far one of the worst I have had. You can tell the ingredients are canned/frozen prior to be added into the curry. The chicken was mushy and in very small pieces. I also had the spring rolls to start and they were quite good and large in size. Wouldn't not recommend this place as I was so disappointed with my order. Would also like to add that they forgot to include rice with my delivery order...it was curry...how could they forget. \nFor a better curry, check out PAI, been there a few times now and always leave with a smile	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	bZBAFTQv4YX2mWeAHc5YbQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It not the best but portions are good and you get pretty decent bang for the buck! Protip: Islam noodles! #secretmenu. I'd describe this dish as pad thai with a rich coconut curry, but not like the khao soi where its noodles in a curry soup. Def recommend to try it if you head there. Everyone knows the chili system now right? from mild to 20? FYI doe, 10 chilis in a curry dish is not as spicy as something say, 10 chilis fried rice, as they fry the chilis and it gets hotter that way. \n\nIt ain't sukhothai or pai, but gets the job done at a good price point!	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	bWvuUQ0XsduI_V5z4DaDSA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

SskpfZ7XxlViDDg6pDTXaQ	3	2011-04-16 00:00:00	Ordered phud thai w/ shrimp. It was okay. Won't order again. The sauce was sparse and lacking deep flavour. It also was fairly light and not the usual orangey-brownish colour a good phud thai has. They do offer a lot of shrimp though, which is pleasing.\n\nAlso tried the mango salad & some of my friend's "shrimp delight". The mango was a little too green & sour for my liking, and again, lacked enough dressing or sauce. Although it feels really healthy when you eat it. The shrimp delight was a no bueno. Wouldn't recommend it at all. You get about 10+ shrimps which is awesome, but its cooked alongside sparse green/red peppers & onions in a really runny sauce that tasted like pre-made canned Thai sauce you get from Metro.\n\nHad coconut ice cream for dessert. Includes two scoops & two praline cigar cookies. Could be shared for two.    \n\nThe rest of the menu looks extremely appetizing though & definitely at good price points. I'm curious to try out more dishes, more specifically, the golden curry or tom yum. Spice is also true to flavour.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	5KFcQxBZfZ_H6NRuSJ5Paw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Very large portion, it has a lot of textures that work well together such as the crunchy egg noodles (chewy when soaked in the soup), noodles were good as well and large amount of chicken breast.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	kO9hTNpCcZ2IkE5NeCiZRA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Sx4KPNOylUnAsmNyaqpDLA	5	2014-06-22 00:00:00	I've been searching for authentic Thai good in Toronto and finally I've found it! Did take out and got the pad thai and green curry, both chicken, and they we're spot on. They both tasted like what I ate everyday for a month in Bangkok, Chang Mai, and the southern islands. No complaints, super yummy and reasonably priced. Sure is a terrible restaurant name though.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	mNXIR5J19QwdDepAzEK2Nw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

SxV6xkzvQHs6g3kEr7i50w	4	2008-11-06 00:00:00	As a Ryerson grad, I believe I am entitled to say whatever I want about Salad King. I have eaten there so many times that I think I have the menu memorized. I recall a handful of awkward first dates that took place there. And it is the only restaurant to date that I feel comfortable eating at by myself (the window seats are so awesome for that).\n\nBUT. I am so back and forth about Salad King. I love love love their Siam Noodles (with a delicious peanut/coconut sauce), and their Green Curry is probably my favourite thing in the world. They have great vegetarian dishes, lots of selection, a generally efficient staff, and lots of water refills (which is totally necessary when you can decide how many chilis you get in your food).\n\nAnd yet I can't stand being there. Their cafeteria setup drives me up the wall. The last time I went, I was surrounded by the most annoying people in the world, and of course, they're so close to you that instead of talking, they're basically yelling in your ear. The great thing about being in restaurants is that you get to talk to the person you're with -- at Salad King, your conversation is broadcast along the whole table.\n\nIf you have reservations or a big enough group, try to make your way up to Linda -- I haven't been up there yet, but I hear it's much better. Or get take out to try how good their food really is. Unless you like being squashed and listening to other people's loud, irritating voices. I sure don't.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Yp7_GeD6KTRoo4Nteqv4SA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

T2LhdIjfNbuT13AJkeRjiw	4	2013-01-04 00:00:00	I have gone to Salad King since the very beginning when it was a ghetto cafeteria where you order at the cash and then pick it on a tray when it was ready. I have loved it ever since then! \n\nMy favourite thing to order off the current menu is the spicy fish. Lightly breaded fish in a slightly sweet sauce. 3 chillies on this fish dish is pretty hot compared to the same chillies count on their cream-based curries. Delicious every time.\n\nOff-the-menu item is the Islamic noodles. Peanut based sauce on rice noodles. \n\nThey now have a frequent diner card.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	lr-uNDv2NMIURR8WT9Z2GQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

If you are looking for a quick, authentic meal with a buzzing atmosphere, stop in here and try the Pad Thai and Green Chicken Curry. \n\nDinner for 2 including an appetizer is easily under $30. Considering the area and dinner options, Salad King is a top choice for authentic, cheap food - unless you like paying $20 for a plate of generic Fish & Chips - then there's lots to check out that are 2 star worthy around these parts.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	L02tQFYyMZuR9aDePsc0pQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

It's still great food. Feel like snacking? Try the Street Noodle Soups and the Mango Salad. Want something more substantial? Their homemade curries (Panang is my fave), selection of fried rice (Thai Fried Rice = yum) and noodles (Pad Thai is the best in the city) will definitely fill you up but won't empty your wallet. Cap it off with their Mango Sticky Rice and you'll walk away from SK feeling happy and full. \n\nThe only caveat? It's noisy and they don't take reservations so you'll often wait 20-30 minutes for a table. It's worth it though.	2	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	YhtJmlqYxFNmgcidFkoitQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The Servers are personable and friendly. \n\nThe only downfall of this Salad King is the seating and the noise level. You can be seated next to several others and it can become loud and very squishy. It's very hard to get room for your jackets and coats (especially in the winter time!) There is just no room for winter gear. The cubbies underneath the seats aren't enough.	0	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ihbaDbhIBYrl3kzUB0mmzg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

TKI1xBM7xbKBnnw-K32uWQ	2	2016-10-02 00:00:00	As an almost daily visitor to their original location, I was happy to finally have the opportunity to stop by at their new swanky spot (not so new or swanky, but comparative....)\n\nI almost wish I hadn't, therefore leaving my memories of Salad King intact as the royalty of inexpensive and ample Thai food.  \n\nHusband and I met for an early lunch and decided to order extra for dinner that night.  Ordered the Spicy Beef, Lime Leaf Chicken and the Islamic Noodles, all 5 chili.    I remember 5 chili's making me beg for a glass of milk, this time around, not even a slight flush.   The good news is that they use fresh chili's, 5 chili's means they cut up 5 chili's in your dish and I guess, this particular day, their batch of chili's was kindergarten mild.  \n\nThey are getting two stars because the meat was very suspect to the point where neither of us wanted to eat it.  Bad flavour, texture and consistency.  We didn't complain because I am pretty sure it wouldn't have made a difference.    I hate suspect meat, I mean, really, who doesn't? \nThis was unfortunate because the favours of the sauces were wonderful.    \n\nThe place is spotlessly clean, the gentleman server we had was super friendly.  We went on a Monday and I am pretty sure we just got left over meat from the weekend. The rice also has a similar  leftovers feel to it.  Regardless, the King is dead to me.	1	2	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	FwgT_pZzsLCRPROEonT0fQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
tnCBtsd8rp3K4v7_sOYrkw	5	2016-04-25 00:00:00	Salad King is six stars.  This is my favorite restaurant in Toronto and probably anywhere.  I love it because it has terrific food at a good price.  We cannot get enough of their phad Thai, green curry and Islamic noodles.  We don't get anything else because these items are so dang good.\n\nThe Salad King recipe for phad Thai is simply the best I've ever had anywhere period.  As one of the owners Ernest once said to me when we told him we were moving to New York City: "New York, they put ketchup in their phad thai.  Yuck!"  And you know what, he was pretty much right.  Most phad Thai dishes in Canada and the United States are sweeter with a red, ketchupy flavor.  Yuck!  At the Salad King, there is no hint of this ... a clear sauce that is flavorful and really pops when you squeeze lime all over the dish.  Truly, the lime is a key flavor for this dish so don't skip it.\n\nThey make their own curry base from scratch ... I've had Linda explain it to me in the past, not that I understood most of it and she probably didn't want me to anyway.  :)  When you go to 99% of Thai places, they use a commercial base they get from a food distributor.  It can still be good, but it explains why the food at the Salad King really is a step above.\n\nI will say other items like fried spring rolls and chicken cashew are not my thing.  They don't have those deep flavors like those other dishes.  You can't be exceptional at everything -- but Salad King is actually exceptional in the phad Thai sauce and curry department.  Eat them often, eat them now.	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	fsi62HIC-My23SSQ0LI0PA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The service and food is average at most, but the most disappointing thing about Salad King is that their food is not "Thai" at all. The curry barely tastes any spices in it, and this is not McD trying to sell Thai Curry where they try to American-ize it. There are so many amazing Thai restaurants in downtown Toronto, I will not come back again.	2	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	O3q-nwYZykMmacxjru01Zg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
TTvAMNYDDWAvx1p4Al6LRQ	4	2013-12-12 00:00:00	Decor/Atmosphere: It's very simple, but nice inside. Not too many decorations, and tables and stools are set up in a cafeteria manner. It gets very loud when its busy and its hard to maintain a conversation, thats the only down fall. \n\nMenu/Food: A lot of different choices for appetizers, curries, noodles, rice, soups, and small dessert menu. \n\nI usually order spring rolls, miniature shrimp rolls, mango salad, hot sour soup, hello curry with chicken, panang curry with chicken, thai islamic noodles, sea food fried rice, and thai basal chicken. (Not that I order all of this in one sitting, but a few of the dishes I have ordered through out my visits here). \n\nThe curries are excellent, and I am not a fan of chilli so I have mine set to 3 always, and add extra if needed. All of the above dish are excellent, and they provide you with a big portion. I always have left overs to take home. I love all the food here so much so I can't really say anything negative as I haven't had a bad experience yet. \n\nCustomer Service: The staff is great, always friendly and smiling. \n\nPrice: Very cheap fast thai food. You can spend $10-12 on a dish and the quantity is worth two meals. \n\nOverall: I come to Salad King at least once a month with friends, and I have been coming here since undergrad, so it is definitely one of top favourite places to eat. I hope they have this place around for many more years to come!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	D-71neazoCYYQkgHnS92FQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

tZJ3L1eETh-9nMHWvEH3xw	3	2016-02-18 00:00:00	I like the food at Salad King... Particularly because they give generous portions and I always have an extra meal for leftovers the next day!\n\nThe servers are friendly, but sometimes the restaurant is so busy that they don't have time to check up on you regularly. I often come here in twos with just one other person, and if I'm seated at a long bench table that's filled with others, it's very squishy and uncomfortable for the both of us. I would much rather prefer a booth, but again, if you go around the regular lunch/dinner time, they're usually busy and don't have space to seat you where you want. I just go for takeout if I see that it's packed.\n\nThe food is still pretty good, but there are a lot of other Thai places in Downtown Toronto that are better in my opinion. My go-to dishes are either the Pad Thai or Islamic Noodles. Both are very flavourful and saucy! \n\nNote: If you can't handle spicy, do not get more than 1 chilli. It makes quite the difference.	2	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	lARJ4ih-0IVq1hvwhhiyuA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
tzUjE_vcMLydROgSVVhuRg	3	2016-01-20 00:00:00	Have you ever wondered why a place with only two salad dishes on their menu would be called Salad King? Hahaha, just a thought.\n\nNot to be confused by the name, this is indeed a Thai restaurant. The décor of this place is made to look like a modern canteen. \n\nWe had a party of 8, but they would not seat us until a majority of our party showed up. Kind of silly since we arrived at 4:30pm, and it was not busy at all. We had 6 people and they finally seated us. We had stools where we sat with no storage under them, so we ended up having to hold our jackets and put our bags on the floor etc. I didn't really like that. \n\nThe service was shotty to start, but got better as our meal progressed. It took a little long to flag down someone to come and take our orders. Food arrived quickly though, and it was pretty good. My husband and I had the green chicken curry and pad thai to share, both with 3 chili spice level which was enough to make me sweat a bit. We also had spring rolls and skewers to start. Both were really good. The server told us that the spring rolls were freshly rolled and the shrimp spring rolls were bought frozen and advised us to order the spring rolls instead. Appreciate the honesty.\n\nOverall, good place for Thai food.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	w8XT23FKowSAR7Lk20J23g	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
tZVk1LcN_UOJg16uS8zfag	3	2016-10-03 00:00:00	It's been ages since I ate at Salad King as a university student with a limited budget. I'm glad to see that they've cleaned up a bit but still offer a number of dishes I used to eat many years ago. \n\nFirst of all the restaurant is located on the second floor and thankfully there are stairs as well as an elevator for greater accessibility. The restaurant also has communal seating at sleek metal tables, so if you don't like eating shoulder to shoulder with strangers, this may not be the place for you. They have  gender indifferent single stall washrooms. \n\nI like that they still offer decent fast casual food at affordable prices. I went with my go to basil beef and hubby ordered the golden curry chicken. There was a generous amount of meat in each of our dishes. I appreciate that you can customize the level of spiciness, where one chili is mild. Rice portions are generous too.\n\nIf in the area of Yonge and Dundas, it is worth checking out Salad King. It can get quite busy, so allot extra time if you're heading to the theatre nearby. The mom and daughter seated next to us did not leave enough time prior to curtain time and ended up leaving before their meal was served	4	2	3	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	EyYVD9n7PlYYLTSEQ5t14w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
t_nXGeXQuFw2CC3sv1DKnA	3	2015-11-14 00:00:00	3.5/5\nSalad King is like a better, bigger and more authentic version of Thai express. Fast food style with servers, longer menu and less personal space. The food here is good and affordable, convenient location too, but nothing stand out. It is great that they offer decent choices for vegetarians and have spicy level to choose from. However I noticed that their cooking are quite inconsistent. \n\nThis place is always busy during lunch/dinner hour. Most of the time you would have to share table and sit between other customers. Not sure if they do reservation, but if I am reserving a table might as well go to PAI or other restaurant.\n\nOne thing I have to point out is the chili count(spicy level). There's a few times my friend and I ordered food with 3 chili, but mine turned out very mild(1chili?) and his tasted like 6-8 chili. That happened a few times already. Get your things together salad King, there's this chili count for a reason!\n\nTheir golden tofu is what I usually order, very well made. The pad Thai is also decent.\nI had the evil jungle prince here once before, expecting mostly eggplants in it since that's impression the description gave. The dish came with lots of onions, lots of green peppers, a couple of other vegetables and a few tiny pieces of eggplant(evil indeed), tasted watered down too. Yup, pretty disappointed. That takes half a star away since you took my eggplants.\n\nI would recommend salad King for a quick tasty meal, but if you want gourmet Thai food this is not the right place.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	tpI40L14ncKqlXKtU8zCzA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

This may have been because it was boxing day and it was extremely busy because many restaurants were closed that day. Service was however good!\n\nMy friends and I ordered the green mango salad, thai basil noodles, panang curry, and mango sticky rice. The flavours that I experienced before were not there and the food wasn't that great. Most dishes were OK and didn't come out that hot. Additionally, the rice that came with the curry was not fully cooked. The mango sticky rice was probably the best part of the meal. \n\nIt's unfortunate because I enjoyed my visit during the summer. Hoping that it was a one day thing!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	20CagUV7kGKjHpYzlIV_GA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
ucAj012ZVGE6vVX0QbLUtQ	3	2011-10-25 00:00:00	My first time back to this restaurant after their move across the street.\n\nOther than the new renovations, the experience was essentially the same - cafeteria style sitting, elbow to elbow with strange neighbours, a level of loudness that makes conversations largely inaudible.  I did notice an expanded seating area to better handle the crowd capacity & private booths and tables in one section (so you can wait for these if you prefer this option). I have to say that for small groups of 2-4, you get seated & served pretty quickly.\n\nIn terms of food, I think salad king does a pretty good job with its core dishes- by this I mean its curries, satays and pad thais. The food is well seasoned & quite tasty.  I'm not sure if i would call the food authentic Thai, but I think they do a good job regardless.   My only comment with regards to core dishes is that the restaurant seems to be cutting back on ingredients. I ordered the panang chicken curry and noticed that it seemed to have a lot of sauce but lacking in chicken.... Likewise, I checked out my neighbour's shrimp pad Thai and noted the obvious lack of shrimp.\n\nAs for appetizers, I think they are average at best. I didn't love the mango salad or mini shrimp rolls- mango salad was pretty dry & shrimp rolls overfried.\n\nEverything said, however, I would go back to salad king although it wouldn't be at the top of my list. Service is decent, but don't go if you expect to have an intimate conversation with your buddy. And forego ordering appetizers- its really not worth it.	2	0	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	NqITYT8IW1JYrwcSKW4uiw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
uIesS8tq8urAOoDXGmkIHA	4	2017-03-07 00:00:00	I haven't been to this joint for a solid 10 years and I must say nothing has changed besides its location.\nThe food was solid, especially the Bangkok Stir Fry Noodles which were delicious. My son inhaled the green curry chicken and I had the orange beef 10 chilies which was perfecto.\nLocation is a bitch for peeps like me from the burbs but if I'm anywhere near Eaton Centre which I try not to be I will definitely stop in for takeout.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	cm3_8c_NDhPcpwJQ96Aixw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
uldVM_bbXJN3stnSL62JNw	3	2012-07-31 00:00:00	You know despite the hype, Salad King is a good place for Thai but I think its popularity supersedes its food. \n\nMy pad thai was good, but not amazing and not spicy. I asked for 3 chilis and honestly, it wasn't spicy enough. Despite my new found tolerance for spice, the portions are quite big which left me with a lot of leftovers. \n\nWhat makes SK great is how cheap the food is, which is why it's a favourite among Ryerson students and frugal eaters like myself. \n\nI ordered take out and it took about 15-20 minutes for my food to get ready. That's not bad considering how insane they are during the lunch rush.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	hYnq9-wO-RzmiTTGMCNJgA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

We are usually seated promptly- only once did we ever have to wait a long time for service. It's not fancy of course, but I have yet to order something that is not delicious. Casual atmosphere, GREAT food, especially for the price, and most importantly- fast serving speeds.

Still my most-frequented lunch and/or dinner spot near Ryerson University. If you come between 2-5pm and show student ID, you get 20% off. \n\nSince it's cafeteria-style seating, this place is best for eating alone or with a maximum of two other people. You wouldn't have a great time bringing a larger group, unless you somehow get one of the few booths (unlikely).	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	AdwIIWT6JTxKcGWkm-Wm6Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

UxT6hYnb8coHRlnFAtNtpg	4	2015-08-27 00:00:00	Salad king is my go to restaurant whenever I'm in Toronto. 98% of the time I order Pad Thai and 2%, some other type of noodle with coconut milk (forgot the name). I decided to order green curry with brown rice. I've had really good Thai curry in Vancouver and was hoping salad king would be just as good. \n\nServing size was huge! Nothing to complain about here! I love the amount of brown rice and curry I got. I felt I got the bang for the buck :) \n\nTaste - it was pretty good, not bad. But, I just can't forgo the taste of the Thai curry from baan wasani in Vancouver. The beef was a on the chewier side. \n\nService - good \n\nOverall, I still will vouch for salad king over anything else in Toronto. I would recommend anyone wanting to try an inexpensive and tasty place 8)	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	lB8knttKTibpg-RJChCBtg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

V7YuDpSz8dkNHAACadallg	5	2008-08-08 00:00:00	Simply awesome.  I'm by no means a "foodie," but after many Torontonians suggested it, we wound up here and I make it a stop every time I'm in town!   The food ranges form mild to wild - you can choose how many peppers you'd like in your meal (I'm still learning to survive in the two pepper range!), and have discovered some amazingly delish dishes (Pineapple fried rice - YUM! And don't forget to try the mango sticky rice!).   I'm only ever eaten downstairs which is the less formal dining space - you sit at tables that are llike Asian cafeteria tables.  Upstairs is more formal.  Price is pretty cheap - lots of nearby Ryerson students love this place for that reason!  Reservations are a must!  If you drop in, the wait could be 45 minutes or longer on the weekend... which just speaks to this place's greatness!  I'm salivating just thinking about it...

We went there, cause someone mentioned it was worth trying. Well, it wasn't! I won't be going there again.\nThai country kitchen, which is near College and Spadina is 10 times better.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	nvkLNe2lz5gAyg7az26VLg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
vA_FEzSFxiN7OTzTNcjYHA	4	2015-01-26 00:00:00	This place is an old fave since I was introduced to it a couple of years ago and went with some trepidation since the name doesn't sound like fab cuisine, does it?\n\nI was so wrong. It really is a great little place. Nice ambience, kinda like a busy cafe more than a restaurant. Contemporary/abstract bright decor and lighting. Always busy and buzzing. And a separate section for take out that functions with military precision (they don't want your details, just give them your order and they give you a reference number that you use to pick up the order. Separate payment area so don't have to hover over diners. We've done quite a bit of take out here, and a few dine ins.)\n\nAs a vegetarian, I found it awesome that the menu has a whole veggie section. The spice level is customized to you. You need to choose the number of chillies. As someone who can seriously handle spice, I would recommend going beyond a 4 or 5 (though they do have it on offer).\n\nI've had the golden tofu, very, very nice. A Masaman kind of curry with peanuts and coconut milk. The spicy tofu wasn't a great hit with me... decent flavours but it relied too much on red and green peppers which I hate. Plus we took that one away; it really got quite soggy and unremarkable when I ate. I've tried a few of the salads; again, didn't love them because when modified to veggie, they seem to lose their punch. And last, I've tried the Islamic noodles, which is on their 'secret' menu. That is awesome. Think Pad Thai, with red curry over the top. Yum. I asked for a tofu one, which I got charged extra for, which confuses me. Why would that cost more that a chicken version?! \n\nThey are child friendly and offer high chairs. My daughter loves the fried rice with breaded shrimp.\n\nReservations aren't easy on the day, but they usually can accommodate a few walk ins if you're happy to wait a bit.\n\nAll in all, they do a contemporary take on Thai very well, and we keep going back. \n\nI've been there with several meat eating companions that all seemed to enjoy their orders. So I'm taking a leap of faith in saying they do that very well too.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	-FO2ECdc5td2gOlg260eoQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

My friends and I sat beside the window and dined while looking onto Yonge Street. \nI loved the seating arrangement and how the restaurant felt casual yet kind of fancy. This place is perfect for any occasion, even a date. [One of my friends was already thinking about having a date here....and was definitely fond of the prices aha]\nFor four people, we ordered 2 dishes because we were tasting all sorts of food that day (just before this, we had burgers and ice cream). \nThey were veggie pad thai and a seafood dish which name i do not recall. Out of all my friends that day, I would be the "weakest" when it comes to spice therefore, we ordered everything either regular/mild/medium. \nI was surprised that the dishes were able to keep their flavour without having spice overpower it. Although we were dying for water afterwards, the servers kept us hydrated for the majority of our stay.\nI vividly remember one waiter coming over at least every 6 minutes. One time, he accidentally missed the cup while pouring and caused a minor spill. It was not bothersome however, he returned to wipe down the spill. \nI am leaving this review at 4 stars for now because I would like to return one more time to confirm my stance.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	jkVaPj3MIS69-OcfX0c_CQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
VHrZzcp-y6ADKxRXVYZsxQ	3	2017-07-21 00:00:00	Was in downtown and most of were hungry. Decided to go Salad King as we had heard of huge quantity and was once described as a hole in the wall type of place. \n\nUpon entering one myth was shattered as it is not a hole in the wall. It seemed a casual place but decorated nicely. \n\nOrdered a Green Mango Salad to start which was 2.5/5. The quantity was good, but lacked enough dressing. \n\nOrdered a Thai Fried Rice, two Tofu dishes - Country and Golden and a Hot Thai Noodles with a spicy scale of 20 chillies. \n\nThe Fried Rice had great curry flavour and vegetables, but the quantity was a huge disappointment. Hardly enough for a person. The Country Tofu was disappointing as well. Not enough flavour and a almost watered gravy and the quantity again not too much. The rice provided was enough. The Golden Tofu was a hit. With flavour and and coconut milk this was perfect except for the quantity. \n\nThe most anticipated dish was the Hot Thai Noodles. We normally ask for less oil, which we forgot and so it seemed too oily for us. The flavour was good, the spices good, however it wasn't 20 or a killer spice. As the quantity on all the dishes were not as much as we expected, we ordered a another Noodles dish called Bangkok Stir Fry. Which came with hair thick rice noodles and veggies. Same as other dishes, lacked flavour and the quantity disappointing.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	xA1Ak4QJ_WE_8Nadpi8IhA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Our food came out maybe 10-15 minutes later which was fabulous because we were all starving. A tad too saucy though which did hinder the experience for me. My friend got the Thai Basil Noodles and they were delicious as well! We also got a beer tower which definitely got us in the mood for our Halloween activities later that evening. \n\nOur waiter was super friendly and amazing, great service filled our waters just the right amount of times.

VR9eQM943AiurUxQwn2VNw	3	2015-10-25 00:00:00	If you are a solo traveler like me, get ready to feel embarrassed and awkward at this place. Especially if you go during dinner time when the place is crowded. That's what happened to me. This place doesn't have the standard sitting. Instead they have long benches with individual seats along both side. I sat next to a Korean couple who kept looking at me because I was eating alone. No type of privacy here. If you want the window seat, come non-rush hour. During rush-hour the window seats are save for party of 6 or more. On to the food. I got Chicken Pad Thai with level 5 spiciness for $10. It was okay. There weren't a lot of substances in the dish such as tofu or veggies. Just mostly noodles, chicken, crushed peanuts, and basil. They have spicy scale, which they add different levels of spiciness to your dish. I got a free spring roll using the minicard you find at hotels. One big plus is that the staff here are attentive.	1	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	HaPM8iQhyjm2pVh3g4bUGw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I wanted 15 stars, however waitress explained that the food is originally 3* spicy, so it will be 18. Food was good ... a bit spicy (felt like the spice overwhelmed the flavor) but not bad.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	CwkEpm0lCai2cJZIp_MMiQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I've found I've had better (and cheaper) pad thai just down the street at another small establishment. The curry was also good. Unfortunately, the server wasn't very attentive and I couldn't even get his attention to refill my glass. Since we are seated alongside and across from other strangers, they noticed, but couldn't help lol	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	_X21Tik3tqeYemTFA_VnFA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
VtJeAGxT9DIiq7YL8OsRlA	2	2011-09-19 00:00:00	I have frequented Salad King for many years and I have to say that since moving to the new location on Yonge Street, above Foot Locker, I've been really disappointed with the food.\n\nThe interior is really cool and there is great ambiance with their cafeteria-like long table seating. The decor is funky and they have cool little quotes on the way to the bathrooms, but the food really leaves nothing but disappointment since moving to the new locale.\n\nThe portions for one have gotten smaller. The have also changed their chilis/flames - I used to get a 7 or a 10 flame (I like my food spicy!) but am now doing a 5-flame, which really has a different flavour than before - it's more "hot" than flavourful. The pad thai has really become awful - I've had it on my last 2 visits (the second time around, I'd forgotten that I'd ordered it the last time and didn't enjoy it - it's such a staple, you would expect it to be good in a Thai restaurant). It was very, very dry, mostly just noodle, with very little chicken and veg. It wasn't very flavourful, just mostly hot. It's definitely not a dish that I would order again - I have had much better Pad/Phud Thai at other restaurants and I'm sad to see that it's gone this way...\n\nThe Golden Curry is another staple we always order, and it's still decent, although again, much smaller of a portion, and somehow less flavourful from before. Bangkok Stirfry is the same deal. I'd have to say I'm not as keen on going back as I used to be, which says a lot about someone who was completely addicted to this place in the past. Disappointed, to say the least... seems like more expensive rent and reno's have really put a damper on things..	0	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	WyodjvNUVta-zO7Ij0TvVw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Honestly, in my mind you could do no wrong.\n\nA fresh to Toronto (and fresh faced) Jennifer of a decade ago, would frequent the small and no frills location on Gould, with Ryerson student card in hand for the 50% off deal (between 2 and 5pm) almost daily.  So many memories! Evil Jungle Prince, eating beside Ja-Rule, the time my girlfriend and I ordered 15 chilis and almost died. \n\nMy heart broke a bit when they gentrified, cleaned up, went handheld devices and communal tables. It did. And my Salad King consumption declined as I graduated and moved on.\n\nCoworker and I, hungry, wandering on Yonge, visited Salad King for dinner after post works drinks on a Thursday evening. Everything is shiny and modern, and I am happy to report, just as good as SK of yesteryear.\n\nBonus Points\n- my adorable and friendly server was actually Thai. (fun right?) I got to practice my pathetic broken Thai phrases on her. \n- Thai Basil noodle 7 chilis is EXACTLY the same as it always was. Amazing.\n- There were plenty of choices for my DC who does not really enjoy pan-asian cusine.\n- Prices were fair. I had a meal, and took two to go for my jealous SO and friend, and my bill was $34. \n- Only Salad King gives me food as Spicy as I like it. 7 chilis was, and always has been, perfect.  \n\nMinus Points\n- I like tea\n- No Chopsticks? what gives?\n- I don't like sitting with newly dating university students fawning all over each other. \n\nSo Happy to have you back.

VzQvhkc3l9MqCaMpho2G4Q	2	2016-06-14 00:00:00	Average spot to grab a quick Thai meal. It's great for groups and people tend to eat fairly quickly so even if it's busy it will clear out fast. I ordered the panang chicken curry dish with medium spice and I'm sad to say it nearly took my head off - I have suspicious feeling that there was more spice than I asked for nevertheless I ate it all anyway. The portions are a decent size and the food arrived promptly after we ordered. Prices range between $9 - 12 for a meal.  I would pay a couple extra bucks and head to Pai instead, but it's not bad for a quick meal if you're in the area.	3	0	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	YEDnTf7d6RyXKEHDGqi9tg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

w8ynObKJh5a8ibYtCBdXsQ	5	2015-10-15 00:00:00	This place is hands down my favourite Thai place, ever! It's delicious, it's quick and it's cheap.\n\nI first learnt about this place years ago. I was doing a coop term near the Eaton Centre and the local lunch stop amongst my Ryerson friends was here. In and out in less than 30 mins and completely satisfied. \n\nBack in the day I would order their Thai green curry (beef), 3 chillies and it hit the spot. Tried and true. Then one day I tried their phud Thai, 4 chillies and holy heck I was converted. More recently I discovered their Siam noodles (chicken), think of a spicy peanut butter curry sauce over noodles. Drool. Granted, the actual physical appearance resembles something you might find at a washroom in the local bar, but the taste is incredible. If you like rice noodles, and you like peanut butter and you like curry, this is for you. You will love it. Trust me.\n\nI once went here with a friend that ordered phud Thai, 10 chillies - yes, he is Sri Lankan. He said it was perfect spiciness for him. I can only do 3 chillies and my brow sweats. \n\nThe seating is not the best. Half the restaurant has private tables and the other half has bench seating. You often have to sit next to strangers, but the turn over is quick. And hey, some of the conversations around you can be hilarious. \n\nIf you haven't stopped here before, you've got to go!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	vcjNP4bLUGqEvZqFLYiQFQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

WbBWg0a7JRadTmF3SQapMg	4	2011-08-14 00:00:00	My reviews are usually long and thorough, but there's a lot to be said from the simplicity of my review of Salad King. The bottom line is, going to Salad King is a safe decision, regardless of what you order. The food is delicious, and there is a wide variety of options. Both the food and the drinks are very affordable. The waiters are efficient and the food comes out fast. Salad King has been serving the masses for awhile now, especially with the Ryerson clientele, and it is clear that they know what they are doing.\n\nThe only downside is the unique atmosphere that may or may not jive with your tastes. On one hand, the decor is all very new and modern looking, mainly due to the recent re-opening after the unfortunate accident at their previous location. On the other hand, a lot of the restaurant feels very much like a high school cafeteria, with a couple of long, metal tables with small hanging lights down the middle. It's not a big deal though, after being seated and eating I quickly stopped noticing.\n\nIn conclusion, Salad King has perfected the art of fast, delicious Thai food. Check it out, you'll enjoy it!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	HcPMsRVza57oqldcwwK_UA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The price I guess is a little high for a cheap lunch, but the amount of food they give you totally makes up for it. It wi easily feed 2 average sized people lol.

WGJtz_nDS2uIWsLYIql5sA	3	2015-09-23 00:00:00	Salad king was the best! They now raised the prices between $1- $2 that it is changing from affordable for students to on the higher end of fast Thai food. The serving sizes definitely decreased usually my staple is the Thai fried rice but now it looks 3/4 of what it usually is and definitely less ingredients! \n\nI would recommend the mango sticky rice which also went up to now $4! It used to be $2.50! \n\nThis is still an option but there are much better restaurants in the area that cost less.\n\nOn the bright side because of the increase, it is much easier to find seats and the noise has definitely been reduced.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	d_uSfozaAZR4OpDNa8IiZQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Pretty decent place for your Thai fix. Went with a friend and we ordered some pretty good dishes. Tried the Tom Yum Soup, Crispy Spring Rolls, Chicken Phud Thai and Golden Chicken Curry with Rice. Great dishes in general. The golden curry was quite flavorful and you can taste the coconut in there. The spring rolls were a nice way to start the meal. Personally, I though the Tom Yum soup was way too spicy for me though but I am sure other people would like it. Overall, great dining experience. Staff were friendly and generally it's not too busy if you go early and it's a pretty big place so there's lots of seating.

It is a very reliable meal that you know will leave you satisfied and likely with leftovers for the next day!\n\nOn my visits I have had both the Islamic Noodles and the Siam Noodles. The Siam Noodles are great however after ordering the Islamic Noodles once, I don't think I will ever go back. Be warned that this "secret menu" item is not too pretty, but the sauce has such a complex combination of flavours that you will be left wanting more. If you have leftovers make sure to take them as the noodles taste great, maybe even better, when they are cold.\n\nAlthough it is nothing out of this world, the food is well priced and tasty. If you are in the Eaton Centre area head over to Salad King instead of the generic food court stalls and taste something more unique to the city of Toronto!	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	j88OKmjUdLFzU51liEgBUA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Every dish that I would order would be a symphony of flavours that hit every tastebud on my tongue. \n\nThose days are over. The papaya and mango salads are disgraceful, bland and missing the appropriate number of ingredients. The pad thai is a sorry excuse for a noodle dish.

wp1lL1S0VCcatInnjoJVyw	3	2014-12-08 00:00:00	Access\nIt used to be around the corner where Ryerson is but since the fire, it is now hidden in the second/third floor of a building. Just walk north from Eatons and you will see the sign Salad King right before you hit Elm Street. Otherwise, just use google maps.\n\nService\nThey are super fast, and I love how they refill my water. Gosh, you don't know how difficult it is to have a restaurant that regularly refills your water without being asked. They function like a fast food chain, zoom zoom baby.\n\nFood\n\nThey have some signature dishes and behold, even a secret menu (reminds me of Starbucks). Before you order, make sure to look on the right (or maybe left) of their paper menu. It will list the level of spiciness - beginning with medium and gradually increasing with the number of peppers. I typically don't go more than 1 pepper but if you like adventure, please try it out yourself.\n\nGolden Curry with Chicken\nThey have 3 different types of curry, with golden curry being their best seller. Now at medium spicy level, it tastes more sweet than hot. I think that's due to the coconut milk and my dad experienced a sour taste as well. I say it's a safe way to go and I love how they stack their rice into a pyramid shape lols.\n\nThai Noodle Soup\nAverage at best, this thing tasted so bland. It's not one of their signature dishes - though it didn't taste horrible, I would move on. You could do a better job cooking at home.\n\nSeafood Fried Rice \nI have a feeling that portion sizes have shrunk but the quality is still top notch. Finally, rice that tastes good and doesn't crumble. Furthermore, they add lots of seasoning to the rice and their squid is mmm yummy. Not too chewy, not too soft. This is one dish I always go back to when I visit Salad King.\n\nNot a bad restaurant for Thai food and the prices are fair. I really hate sitting where the long tables are because frankly, where the hell am I going to put my big jacket and purse? Other than that, the restaurant is quite consistent with their quality though it is nothing to praise about.	2	1	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Iu55D7RAAW8TACA3lN0w8Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I was out with two of my friends and both happen to be lactose intolerance, and we just happen to wander past this place, three of us also prefer different level of spiciness to which one of my friend can't have spicy food at all, the other likes extremely spicy food. This place is perfect because it uses coconut milk for its curry and has different spicy levels for its curry dishes. I believe the different levels are 1, 3, 5, 10, 20?

Overall, it was decent tasting and worth it's price. Not too oily, not too saucy, not too dry, and not too bland. In fact, I can't really put a finger on anything about it that was bad. At the same time however, I can't point out anything that was exceptionally good.\n\nIf I were craving Thai food, I guess I would consider coming here again.

One of my take out they gave me the wrong order BUT BUT The up side was nothing at salad king is bad so I didn't mind trying something new and now I have something I quite enjoy.\n\nThe food after 2 weeks has FINALLY started getting a little better, the sauce for the pad thai is finally tasting as it use to.  My Islamic noodles also make me very happy now.  \n\nFew Key Notes However:\n- Food is SMALLER\n- Prices have gone up about $0.50-$1.50.  (Probably to cover the loss of revenue but do you think they'll lower the price AFTER they regain it...probably not)\n- Place is A LOT nicer than the older one\n- Take out takes a LONG time...Longer than if you were to sit and eat your meal. BUT Take out is LARGER than when you sit and eat\n\n\nThe one thing I don't like about Salad King which is actually one of its more charming qualities others would think is the way they seat people.  I don't mind sitting next to people, in a movie i'd rather not sit with someone right beside me but if there are no seats no problem.  I'm from Asia I'm very use to sharing a table.  Now the last time I sat here I had the most obnoxious girl talking about how her daddy buys her 1000 dollar purses every week and how she'll never marry a man that cant pay for her every expense.  Being a woman and being very independent I wanted to fling pad thai with chili right into her eyes.  And it wasn't like she was quite it was as if her voice was attempting to overthrow the ENTIRE restaurant.  Again, I love Salad King, not to hot with the seating arrangement.  \n\n\nOverall, I love this place! And when I have time I WILL ALWAYS WAIT FOR TAKE OUT! \n\nCost: 2 people, 1 app, 2 mains, $27.\nFood quality: 5/5\nFood quantity: Unsure as of yet\nService: 4/5\n\nWould I Go Again: Of Course.	0	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	-fEe8XBeJ6pGLIeAyAWzfw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

X--EIql_D1Ilmzjcab_A2A	3	2015-05-02 00:00:00	I have been here many times and have always had a very adequate experience. The food comes out quick and fresh, and tastes good. I usually order the green curry. it comes with an rich and sweet broth, filled with broccoli and sweet peas, served with rice shaped like a pyramid.\n\nThe last time I went to the Salad King there was one pretty big disappointment - I ordered the Tom yum soup, which is supposed to be lemongrass broth with mushrooms, chicken, and shrimp. But when it came there was no chicken or shrimp; it was just broth. Half the substance of the dish was missing. It was odd to me.\n\nOtherwise I would say that if you are in the area, try the green curry or any of the curries really. The noodles are all right too.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	qHwj63QRTu_rWWGMNuoQlg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
X-Gt2e-w10sOYZtkRY3nvQ	3	2017-01-24 00:00:00	Funny how they call it salad king but only have 1 salad on the menu.\n\nIt's located right by Ryerson, so it's definitely convenient for students on a budget. The atmosphere was like a cafeteria, but a pinch more upscale with cuter decor than a typical highschool lunch hall.\n\nLike most Thai places, they had sizeable portions. My friend and I ordered the pad thai and the panang curry to share. Overall, the food was meh. It made me full, but not the happy kind of full. The panang curry was too sweet but not rich, and the pad thai was a little dry. \n\nHighly recommend hot sauce if you're thinking of eating at this place.\n\nBut I wont go back again.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	kYIODM8u94H7IyHY806CAA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

If you like spice, I'd definitely recommend upping the amount of spice you get because I got one pepper and I couldn't taste anything (even though I'm usually a wimp when it comes to spicy food).

But keep your eyes open and you will see the menu outside the door where the elevator is located.\n\nAs I am writing this review, I've been back 3 times (at least) so far but the first time I went, it was for lunch on a Saturday. Thanksfully I went early enough so there was no wait and we got one of the few booths avail.\n\nOrdered: PAPAYA SALAD 1/5\n*Green papaya with Thai dressing for $5\n*Had the best papaya salad in Thailand last summer so I was excited to see this on the menu\n*When this first arrived, I was confused for a second and thought maybe they took my order wrong\n*This had strips of papaya with tomato, peanut bits, dried shrimp and lime juice\n*This was basically pieces of papaya drenched in lime juice\n*It was just very sour with the lime juice and I couldn't taste any garlic or peanuts\n*Original papaya salad should be bursting with different flavors of garlic, peanuts, fish sauce and cilantro\n*They were just doing it completely wrong and I don't know if people actually enjoy this cause it was horrible\n*I would never ever get this again and even if they gave it to me for free, I wouldn't eat it\n\nOrdered: BEEF SATAY SKEWERS 3/5\n*4 skewers for $5\n*These are made with thin beef slices instead of beef cubes\n*served with thick peanut sauce which was good but it had this weird color\n*Peanut sauce was more so mustardy-mayoy than peanut butter\n*Meat had good flavor but it was so thin I feel like this dish could be cheaper\n\nOrdered: GREEN CURRY WITH CHICKEN 3.5/5\n*Served with jasmine rice for $8.75\n*Green curry had chicken, green bean, broccoli and basil\n*Curry itself wasn't too creamy but it had good coconut flavor\n*As I was scooping some up to have it with my rice, I found the curry to be too runny\n*It came with lots of chicken pieces but near the end, I had too much curry compared to the rice\n\nOrdered: ISLAMIC NOODLES 5/5\n*This is their not so secret 'secret menu' that was super popular when they were open at last location\n*It's not on the menu, but if you ask they will make it for you (and you def want to ask for this!)\n*Pad Thai noodles drenched in coconut curry for $10.50\n*Came with 4-5 shrimp and chicken pieces on top\n*The sauce is creamy with a bit of kick which was perfect with the noodles\n*Lots of veggies (green pepper and red pepper) were on top\n*I could def taste lots of spice in this particular dish\n*I really enjoyed this and understand why it's one of their most popular dish\n\nOverall there was a good service, our server was Rob who wasn't over the top friendly, but was attentive and filled up our water when needed. That's more than good enough at busy restaurants like this especially at usy lunch hour.\n\nAfter my first visit, I went back couple more times and I will just include my comments about the dishes within this posting.\n\nOrdered: MINIATURE SHRIMP ROLLS 4/5\n*10 mini shrimp spring rolls for $4.50\n*This is perfect as an appetizer in terms of taste, portion and price\n*They are nothing special and you coulod probably get them anywhere but for $4.50, it's perfect for sharing\n*It's filled with shrimp inside and goes very well with the sweet plum sauce\n\nOrdered: THAI FRIED RICE 3/5\n*Fried rice with eggs, shrimp, chicken, carrots, onions and curry sauce\n*Tasted just like any other Chinese fried rice but with hint of curry\n*I needed hot sauce for this dish cause it was kind of bland and dry\n*It was nothing special and I probably won't get this again\n\nOrdered: THAI BASIL NOODLE 3.5/5\n*Rice noodles stir fried with veggies and shrimp with garlic, chili, shallows and dried shrimp sauce\n*This was just another version of Pad Thai for me, except with the tomato-ey ketchupy taste\n*Again, some basil leaf thrown on top...is it suppose to work as garnish?\n*Thai food is usually known for dishes with lots of complex flavors altogether but this was very bland\n*It was decent, but I much prefer the Islamic noodles I had last time\n\nSummary: I've been to Salad King about 3 times so far and I really do like it. Now I know what to order and what's good here. I recommend going early if you are dropping by for lunch and don't expect to have a important conversation here because it gets super loud due to their low ceiling. I recommend, Mini Shrimp Spring rolls, Beef/Chicken skewers and Islamic Noodles(yum!)	5	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	LmWO_u9v7e1vMJlNykjUoA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
xmiETK_nct8uGHXwKcYN_w	4	2008-11-28 00:00:00	It's a mainstay for Toronto lunches, is always packed, and it's also become a place where people use it as a contest.  We are talking Salad King.  Just off the core of downtown, it's pretty much walking distance from anywhere in the core, reason being that you'll find that folks will make the journey, no matter how far, to get there.\n\nA booming take-out service and a rapid sit-down-anywhere table service gets you your food fast.  The place is clean, modernized, and swarming with staff that buzz about getting you to you table and ensuring that you're seated and eating as soon as possible.  Salad King has a huge array of Asian dishes, but the specialty is the noodle dishes, particularly the Pad Thai.  Where the gaming comes in is the heat.  You are able to select the number of "peppers" (a heat scale used by the kitchen) to make your dish as mild or as brutal as you like.  This is where the spicy food eaters get puffy chested and boast about the fact that they can eat a "15" at Salad King, knowing full well that in all probability, the scale is sliding for the Caucasian customer.\n\nRegardless, it's good eats.	0	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	DOZtiJTh6ZYsZJcXgPrdBg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

xNVrRJdjkH-IcN-GyiJeIQ	4	2015-10-19 00:00:00	Came hear with my dad. Everything was very good. I had the Islamic noodle (chicken) and it tastes exactly as I imagined it to be from the picture. It had lots of coconut flavour in the curry. My curry was mild and i thought that was good enough for me. It still had a slight heat. Enough to make it feel like a curry. If you can't handle your spicy i think a mild is the way to go. The noodles were great. They were practical drowning in the curry. It absorbed all the curry flavours. The veggies were all nice, mixed in with all that creamy curry. The chicken didn't really seen to fit in. At first I didn't even know it was chicken. I think next time I'll order the veggie version. My dad had the fried rice. He enjoyed it but he liked my Islamic noodle better. The portion was huge. I thought the bowl was endless.	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	B6nvVUcnj5r7mNll1iCxXQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

XP6Fii3wam0Wwx93rxKcZw	2	2013-11-10 00:00:00	This is the place to go if you want spicy thai food. They have a legend with a range of different spice levels you can choose from to customize your dish. Some dishes are already a bit spicy on their own, so you can also just ask for no additional spice. I usually only order medium (the least spicy option on the legend) and find that it still has a kick in my wimpy mouth. \n\nTheir curries are deliciously flavoured but a bit thin and don't have a lot in them (usually after a few spoonfuls, the meat and vegetables run out and I am left with just a lot of sauce). I also don't think the quality of the meat is very high. However, the price is very affordable and I would prefer to come here over a food court.\n\nI hate the seating here because of the bench style (no back on the seats) and difficulty storing your jacket while you eat. They have metal baskets under the benches, so you could roll up your coat and put it in, but this is difficult with winter coats or nice coats you don't want to jam into a tight space. The only other option is to just hold your coat in your lap. Probably the worst seating arrangements I've experienced in a restaurant.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	zwX-myHFS59-7ofp9cXVuw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The noodles were bland and whole dish was just lacking in flavor. So odd.\n\nAlso, the noodles seemed to be cooked in water and then thrown together in the dish as opposed to stir fried, which I found odd. \n\nThe space and service were both nice, just stay away from the noodle dishes.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	de-4DY8kS7MT-VgDMShyzA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Y-JmFsQB0YpvN_9a0181CQ	4	2010-06-03 00:00:00	Five years ago this was a real gem. The restaurant seated about 50 people and the kitchen was over to the right corner. The portions were big and the service was quick. There was a really nifty microphone screeching "NUMBA FOOOTEEEN" and there was a sock covering the mic. There were Ernie and Linda in the back still serving and cooking themselves. These were the times Salad King deserved 5 stars. \n\nThe service has lacked since the reopening a few years ago. Now seats 130 people downstairs and another 60 upstairs. Too many seats. The kitchen now slaps together pre-fried chicken and rice so sticky, you could use it as gunk to fix your exhaust pipes. \n\nIt's still good and very adjusted to Salt, Sugar and Spice saturated North American taste buds (or should I say hung-over students?)\nCurries tend to be a bit runny and the meats a bit dry.\n\nDo yourself a favor: Go between peak hours, your portion size increases and the waiting time decreases, almost like good old times. \nMinus the sock-mic, my personal "NUMBAAA WOOOOO"	1	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	k19pjXVZrXDq6XPgwzVIWg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
Y0DZm_g24VcJMyS5p9bVlg	4	2016-03-08 00:00:00	Salad King is one of the better options for downtown dining.  The quality far exceeds the price.  With some incredibly flavorful dishes, at very affordable prices, you can eat like a true Salad King.  My favorite is the Spicy Beef and rice, a generous portion of beef and vegetables, that tastes wonderful.  Their other options are great also, bearing in mind that the menu is quite extensive, almost each and every item delivers what is promised.  With perhaps the exception of the noodle soup.  This is the only letdown, considerably blander then other choices, it is however, an anomaly on an otherwise flawless experience.  \n\nWhen coming here, I really recommend the spring rolls, there is something about them that separates them from most other Thai restaurants.  I don't usually sing the praises of spring rolls, but these are phenomenal.\n\nDinner and drinks for two people for under $30, money well spent, in a great location.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	0cKr_XWLM2qLQy9j6UpHSg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I ordered one of my favorite meals, the "Hot Chicken with Cashews"... and was a bit disappointed; although the flavour and were there, the rice wasn't sticky and the sauce was more of a broth (not thick enough... or at all, actually) which made it impossible to eat with chopsticks. \n\nThis said, I am not closed to the idea of giving it another chance on my next trip to Toronto.\n\nNB: For those who like their food with some kick, you can add some spiciness to whichever plate you choose (see Karine V.'s photo: http://bit.ly/k0aU6f)...  Which makes me wonder; did anyone ever try a meal with an "20 chilis"?\n\nPS: If you have to use the restrooms, you might like the intimacy the individual stalls offer (each of which has its own sink) whether you need to freshen up, touch up your makeup or... want some alone time with your bo ;-)	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	9rEQtVw5En6jm8gN9vCWPQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I had a dish of chicken pad thai there today for lunch and it was soggy and pretty tasteless ..Even the Indian cook at Supermarket Lounge on Augusta Ave in the Kensington Market does a much better job at the dish.

I've been going to Salad King since my early university days and I have seldom, if ever, had a bad experience here. The communal seating format is not the best but I've come to associate it with this place so i don't mind it much. The service is always extremely fast, the pricing has only slightly changed in the last decade and most importantly, the food is consistently DELICIOUS and served in huge portions. Best items on the menu have to be the veggie spring rolls, the chicken skewers, the green curry with chicken, the Thai fried rice and of course, the Islamic Thai noodles with chicken and shrimp. You just cannot go wrong with any of these. You can now also order it for delivery through Foodora, and it'll taste just as good at home.

YcEUlDABBAAA5eh884_IBg	3	2015-08-05 00:00:00	So let's compare the not-so-new location now to the old one across the street!\n\nThe old location was smaller, had a second floor which was hardly ever open and although it was well known to the college crowd the place never seem to get neither as packed nor as loud as the new location. Which in a way it is a shame. Since as other Yelpers mentioned, almost everyone's half-brother's cousin's, mother's aunt has come here.  \n\nIn general the not-so-new Salad King has lost some charm, as the venue, tried to at least look a tad more upmarket after the renovation yet SK continued with the cafeteria seating concept. The fact is you can't make cafeteria eating classy, you can try to make it fun (Guu?) but classier? Nope. As such the renovation, although not bad, seems to have been a bit of a misstep, which undoubtedly was done to maximize seating space.  \n\nGranted they are some tables sprinkled around the ends of the floor but since the whole place is open concept, get ready for a really noisy lunch, worse for dinner... louder than what you would find at a mall's food court, since at least those tend to be a lot larger. \n\nPrice-wise it is not too bad. If I do drop by, I generally go for a super spicy (10+) curry or pad Thai which are okay, although most importantly, they are filling. Service is fast if utterly indifferent and the food seems to be consistent. \n\nRemember, when you come to Salad King, you are no longer going for a hole in the wall, you are going to a loud, arguably not bad looking venue and to have one unhealthy meal. \n\nTheir pad Thais although tasty, are very salty and I assume not very healthy. I have had some of their other dishes and again, they are not bad, but I have had better.\n\nThe biggest draws for Salad King is their location (for a local) and somewhat student-friendly prices. However with an increase of better quality, healthier and "almost" equally priced Thai places, Salad King has lost some of its lustre. Not because it is a terrible place, it is not, the bar simply has been raised by competition like Sukhothai and Khao San Road.\n\nAnd it goes without saying, the place does not specialize in Salads. ;-)	0	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	EC5TGpxONfz4IZIjML0DpQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
yDuPnlOvwDHBhh9IOuk3yA	5	2014-07-27 00:00:00	Great and cheap Thai food. I typically get the Chicken Panang (7 chilies) and Siam Noodles (5 chilies) and split with my friend. Love the Panang curry and the peanut sauce on the noodles is heavenly! Can't go wrong with either dish and the price can't be beat!

yiqDWh5UresFm_8xRIBC_Q	1	2016-06-23 00:00:00	Honestly, they have the worst customer services for a restaurant in the downtown core. First impression - We didn't realize the Plus size girl who was wearing street clothes was a hostess for the restaurant but whatever.  \n\nThe Restaurant is loud as F***! When we asked to be seated in a less noisy area. We couldn't even hear Hostess explain herself. But She said during dinner hours only 3 people or more is allowed to sit in the quiet area. It was a Wednesday night after 7 PM, and The Restaurant was less than half full?! We told her if we can't sit in a quiet area then we'll leave. \n\nHer response was "That is Fine".  \n\nWell, we went to Basil Box across the street! The hell with your Off The Street Hostess, your school cafeteria tables, and chairs! \n\nMcDonald's have better Customer Service and decor than you guys, and they serve FAST FOOD!	2	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	VyDemwHXjk6oZ2emfB1NHw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I usually ask them to sit somewhere else because I really don't want to sit next to a random person and hear their conversation while eating my meal with friends.  So far in my multiple visits, I've always had a good experience here and would recommend it to anyone wanting to have some good and cheap thai food.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	ng1NkCbhVnQf-oCe32EPAg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

yl_AqcVMoWdkvHD6srdVSA	3	2015-11-22 00:00:00	You know that saying: "Thai food is Asian food for white people"?\n\nI really never understood that line - the flavouring on Thai cuisine is really intense (I mean the balancing of sweet/sour/salty/spicy -- not this odd perception that Thai food has to be spicy).  Even though Thai food is made for Western cutlery (no chopsticks!), the individual portioning (most Asian meals are 'family style') and there's less focus on 'offal' meat than most other Asian cuisine - I don't understand the popularity for Western palettes.\n\nHowever, Salad King has pretty much perfected the Thai formula for a Western audience - it's pop and tries to be all things to all people.  If you doubt me, check out the line-up for this Salad King on any given night.\n\nWhile Salad King isn't bad by any means - it's really mall food court Thai served in a slight nicer dining room.  The portions are big and most people don't really care that it's relatively bland (adding spice to a dish is the same as drizzling hot sauce on anything).\n\nWhen I'm hungry, I usually grab takeout from Salad King - the off-menu Islamic noodles (chicken pad thai with a coconut curry) is the go-to.  It's not the best Thai, but the portions are big and their takeout system is down to a science.  It's perfectly serviceable, but not much more beyond that.	1	2	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	aomkMAGFrL-gD6cqQjB4bw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

This was a few years ago, so I was excited to check it out at its new location. It was just as packed as ever, and the service was efficient and pleasant. I also liked the communal dining style. \n\nHowever, the dish I'd ordered was not that good at all - I had ordered the Khao Soi which is one of my favourite Thai dishes. It had such a strong fishy taste that it totally detracted from the other flavours. I probably wouldn't go again on my own accord but tag along if someone else wanted to check it out. I'd also definitely order something different - maybe the green curry because who would screw up a green curry, right?	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	HwxL-y5h2j4swM1A8BvqfQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
yWeQ9JDRlQnQ1qcDGysc4A	4	2015-11-06 00:00:00	King? Maybe. Salad? Not so much.\n\nWell, what I mean by that is that it was good, hence yes to the 'King' part, but I really didn't understand why it had 'Salad' in the name considering most options were rice and noodle based with chicken, shrimp or beef. Yes, there were vegetarian options, but not to the point where they can be called Salad King!\n\nAnyway, don't let the outside of this place fool you. It's like a little hole in the wall type deal from the outside. Small entrance, you have to climb to flights of stairs to get there. It gives you the impression that it'll be some small place with less seating and quick service - but not at all! It's actually extremely spacious from the inside. The seating arrangement is a mix of tables and long benches that basically seat separate groups of people next to each other.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive. We were recommended the Islamic Noodles by a friend so that's what we ordered. The helpings seemed fairly large so we decided to share one (turned out to be a decent decision because we weren't super hungry). The noodles arrived fairly quickly. Oh, I should mention they also have various options for spice. We went with level 3 which turned seemed like the right decision in the end. The waitress said she usually orders between a 7 and 12 - I'm not sure how she survives. \n\nAs mentioned, the helping was large which is always a plus. It was flavourful, it had a nice mix of vegetables and we ordered it with chicken which in the end was probably less than we would've liked. Overall, it wasn't out of this world but it was definitely very good. The price was just north of $11. \n\nIn the end, a 4/5 because it was a happening place yet the food didn't take very long to arrive. We were very satisfied with our meal, and the price wasn't crazy. Waitress was also friendly and willing to help out with our order - although I'm glad we didn't go with her spice level!	0	0	2	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	bulL8xAKQQ6PoTPzOsnO_g	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

But that doesn't mean it's good.\n\nI was craving Thai food on Saturday at about 6 p.m. I realize that this place is buzzing with activity, but I would still appreciate some genuine service. My server never spoke more than three words at a time to me.\n\nFoodwise, I left unsatisfied. My shrimp pad thai was a good-sized portion, but no amount of lime juice could bring the right zest back into these lacklustre noodles.\n\nAnd as a matter of personal taste, I prefer standard seating as opposed to Salad King's communal tables, although I did like hearing the adjacent couple discussing such topics as, "Well, would you prefer that we were engaged?"\n\nI left briskly and don't expect to return anytime soon.\n\n$10 for an order of pad thai, including taxes.	2	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	yjk9lzTngLoSvRvIqjTVpw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
YxahLB0LUPU6l5viODNDPA	2	2012-06-20 00:00:00	Went here on a weekend during the day after being in the area for the NXME music thingymajig. \n\nFirstly I hate waiting for anything longer than 5 minutes, I get agitated and fiddle and break things so it was no surprise that I bumped into a vase and broke it after waiting for nearly 15 minutes to be seated.\n\nThe place was busy but the available tables were only for 4+ groups so since it was just me and my friend we had to wait for seats to come free in the communal area. First time I have seen this in Toronto and I was never a big fan of it in the UK and I am still not a big fan of having to share my personal space whilst eating with people I do not know. \n\nThe menu at first instance looked good, there are a fair few dishes and you have the option of requesting anything from a 1 chilli to a 20 chilli dish - I think a 20 chilli dish would require waxing of the tongue Home Simpson style so I went for a Beef Dish at level 5.\n\nThe food came out super quick, as if the kitchen staff had a precognitive vision of what I would order before I had a chance to break anything, but I would have preferred in this case to wait for something that did not look rushed or not looked like the beef had been cooked in the morning and kept on a low heat till i arrived.\n\nSo overall the experience was disappointing, the service was, once seated, quick and the waiter kept the water topped up and was polite and attentive.\n\nDo not see myself going here in a rush any time soon unless I have a group of 20 to seat.	2	2	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	S10Q9h_W-MKyog8IdcCNCQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
YYcJ-4Gsxi1n2n_twFCFBA	4	2011-10-21 00:00:00	I never had a chance to go to the old location, and then it burned down. It was a sad day as soooo many of my friends would rave about the mighty Salad King and how amazing their Pad Thai was.\n\nFinally had a chance to hit up their new location the other night... There's a long trek up some flights of stairs, which makes you feel like you're hitting a night club as the crowd gets increasingly louder. We were greeted by a pleasant woman who sat us down in a nice booth location. The place was quickly filling up and everyone who arrived after us were crammed at communal tables, where couples had to sit rather close to other couples. Would not be my ideal choice of seating.\n\nA girl dropped of some cups of water and seconds later our waiter arrived. He was super nice and ordering was a snap. Our appetizers seemed to magically appear minutes later, and our main dishes shortly followed. I had the Golden Tofu Curry and it was pretty good -- about as good as any other I've had at Thai restaurants. Overall we enjoyed our food and the final bill was rather cheap in my mind, but the portion sizes seemed about right for that figure.\n\nI liked the washrooms: individual unisex stalls with your own sink. Everything was automated so I didn't touch a thing really. And on this occasion they seemed to smell kind of nice.\n\nI like Salad King. The location is not really an area I am around very often, but I think it would definitely be a top choice if I am ever in that hood and want to take someone out for a nice meal.	2	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	uSMK7y_H2DzRX7WcKXtFgQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Located up a set of stairs, I wouldn't have known the restaurant was there unless my friends had told me. Inside, it was set up (at least to me), like a cafeteria with rows of benches and long tables. The interior looked neat, clean, and urban. \n\nThe food was great! I tried my curry with minimal spice because I know I can't handle spicy food, and I loved how it tasted. My friend got the seafood fried rice and shared some with me. It was great! I hadn't really tried Thai food up until then, so this was a good food experience to my taste buds. \n\nI won't be coming here regularly because of the busyness which slightly turns me away (sometimes the wait time to get a table can be extensive without a reservation, but it goes to show the place is popular) and price tag but I recommend that every Ryerson student (since it's right by school) should try Salad King (and Chipotle, Five Guys, Panera, Bam Nhi Boys etc) at least once.

z1Wbw79CLyPlm4PVFWgxxg	3	2014-10-01 00:00:00	I've eaten at Salad King more than I'd like to admit. Despite its name, Salad King serves average Thai food, but comes in a generous portion and is fairly priced. Spiciness of the dish is to your discretion which is nice to have a choice. The not-so-secret Islamic noodles is always a popular choice. We usually order this with chicken and shrimp (one of the few dishes which you can get both in). \n\nThe cramped cafeteria style seating isn't really to my liking but it provides them with ample seating and a high turnover rate. There are baskets beneath the seat to store your belongings while you eat because there's absolutely no room to leave anything lying around. \n\nOverall, the food is good if you aren't too picky about authenticity. It's cheap, large portions that comes quickly, and I really can't complain about the taste.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	gUHGfOpInuzNVvoH6w0K9g	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

The seating is almost like a cafeteria, but i never mind because the food more than makes up for it. \n  I usually order a noodle dish with 5 or 10 chillies depending on how adventurous i feel. The portions of the noodle dishes are generally huge so bring your appetite. Although the food is so good you might not want to leave any on the plate.

z3i0OpKJNregEguPMtxTFw	3	2016-04-09 00:00:00	+.5 for service\n\nSalad King is a popular establishment for Ryerson students who want Thai food without venturing too far from campus. No matter which day you go, that place is guaranteed to be busy for lunch, dinner, etc. It's located up one floor, but there's an elevator for those who need to use it.\n\nI came here without much expectations, as I've tried places like Pai, Khao San Road, and Sukho Thai and know what excellent Thai food is. I expected large portions, but food quality to be barely above fast food.\n\nI ordered the siam noodles with chicken, as I was intrigued by the peanuts and coconut milk sauce. The food took a little while to come, but needless to say from my photo the portions were gigantic. I was actually very surprised that I was able to finish the whole thing; good thing I was starving during the morning! As for the quality...meh. The sauce wasn't bad, but the noodles definitely felt extremely low quality. For $10.50 I expected a little more from the quality side, and I'm willing to have a smaller plate for an increase in food quality.\n\nIt was an experience for the most part just to see what the hype was about, but despite the excellent timely service I received, I don't think I'll return as there are other Thai places nearby which I've enjoyed their food and have reasonable prices (such as Thai on Yonge).	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I love Thai food, so I was expecting a good menu and a busy spot.\n\nWhat I got was so much better! The place is huge! It takes up the second floor, with great art work and wall murals, one of which says SERENITY NOW! Hahaha Seinfeld! \n\nSo we ordered some crispy spring rolls to start, my cousin ordered the siam noodle something...and her man and I both ordered pineapple chicken with rice, medium spicy! \n\nEverything was delicious! Though the sauce that came with the spring rolls had a bit too much vinegar to my liking. I have an issue with my eyes being bigger than my stomach, and only got half of the pineapple chicken. \n\nThe service was lovely, we had regular water refills and our meals came out very fast!\n\nNow, because of the issue I have with my eyes and my stomach, so unfortunately I had to take my mango sticky rice to go...which was such a shame, because it was so warm and delightful. By the time I got to eat it, all of the warm goodness had disappeared...still amazing, but hey, my fault. \n\nI'm totally going back next time I come visit, just for the mango sticky rice. :)	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	zwBD7ED3qvFt6wPCcA7Pbg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
ze16vak2-AIavY7F7_8yzQ	3	2016-06-22 00:00:00	Finally got around to trying this place after living nearby for a decade.  A DECADE of loving Thai food.  \n\nThese days, Toronto has great Thai options (well..maybe just Pai).  I also recently had "fake" Thai food at Thai Basil in Annex that I enjoyed, despite it's ketchupy fakeness.  So I am pretty lenient when it comes to my pad thai.\n\nWe did pick up of veggie pad thai, chicken basil, and spring rolls (3 to an order). \n\nI didn't like the tofu in the veggie pad thai, especially compared to the beautiful veggies and tofu from Pai's vegetarian pad thai.  At Thai Basil, there were no veggies or tofu or anything, really, but the sauce was much better.\n\nThe chicken basil dish, however, was good.  The rice it came with smelled really weird to me (I'm a "super smeller") and I couldn't eat it.  Spring rolls were very standard.  No need to revisit with all the options these days.\n\nWe got "mild" pad thai but it could have use some sriracha or somethin'.	2	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	m5b84-nPPVNLlDtZyVGZ3w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

Food arrived really quickly. \nFood wasn't that great, but it wasn't bad either- it was ok. I was expecting more since my friends were all raving about it. I haven't been to many Thai restaurants but I think I prefer Thai one on, although Salad king is much cheaper.\n\nI also really appreciate how they have a spiciness scale from medium to 20, which is pretty awesome. I love, love love spicy food - I am the crazy person who picks chili peppers out of dishes and eats them plain- and I went for an 8 for my green curry beef, which I found to be a good spiciness level for me (noticeable spicy, but in a very comfortable way)- so I imagine 20 must be really spicy. One of the few places, in my personal experience, that actually mean it when they say hot. \n\nThough it was spicy, I found the food a bit bland, and the rice tasted a bit like instant rice. \nI would come back again if I was in a hurry and not feeling adventurous enough to try a new place. Or maybe when I'm craving something super spicy.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	YVlZCtZeSkYT9sdTfeKodw	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
ZiK3eUoFnulk2RKKQlGvZg	2	2010-08-13 00:00:00	I wanted to give one star because of the horrible customer service I had at Salad King during my last experience, however, I've been here plenty of times before and most times it's been decent enough.  The food is alright and price is economical.  \n\nI've had the pad thai many many times before, and  I always ask for it to be "extra saucy" because I don't like it when it's very dry.  However, I went there with 2 of my friends and when the waiter was taking our order, i asked for my usual, pad thai with extra sauce.  He stared at me blankly with a confused expression on his face.  I told him that I always ask for it to be extra saucy and so the chef should know what that means, he nodded and brought the order in.   It didn't take long for our food to come out, and of course my pad thai was dry, without the extra sauce.  Thinking, okay, that's fine, they might have forgot, I'd eat it anyway.  However when i took my first bite, it was SO SOUR!!!! It tasted like someone poured an ENTIRE bottle of vinegar into the noodles.  I could not eat it!! So I called the waiter over, explained that the noodles were sour and that i could not eat it.  He took the noodles back in, only to bring the SAME dish back out saying that I had asked for extra sauce.  I proceeded to explain to him that yes, I did say that but there was no extra sauce and that it was SOUR and not edible.  I asked to speak to a manager because he didn't seem to understand what I was saying.  When the manager came over, he ARGUED with me that I had asked for extra sauce, he then POINTED at the menu and told me that it specified that pad thai has "tamarind sauce" in the noodles, so that's what they added.  I explained to him that no, i wanted it to be extra saucy, that I wanted it to be wet! He argued/ yelled at me and told me that I asked for extra sauce, and was not specific enough and that it was my fault!  Frustrated, I told him to forget the extra sauce ad asked if he could bring me out a new dish, without any extra anything.  He then said , ok so would you like me to add that to the bill?  I looked at him and said, NO, i would like you to replace this one.  He refused and said "what am I going to do with these noodles?  I can't waste them!"   At that point, I was FURIOUS, how can a manger be like this to a customer?  and seriously, how much are noodles that you can't make a customer happy and just replace them?  Finally, I didn't want to argue anymore because we were on a schedule (we had tickets to a game), and told him to just leave it.  He actually left it and did NOTHING to make up for it.  Needless to say, I did not touch the dish.  Luckily, both my friends were willing to share what they ordered.  Throughout the rest of the meal, we got dirty looks from ALL the wait staff and when we asked for the bill, it took them forever to bring it out and the waiter just threw it on the table.  After the experience we had, we all agreed that we were not giving them any tips.  We paid them exact change with NO extra, none of the staff deserved anything.  Horrible horrible experience and I will never go there again.	1	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	TbXRPv3Df_BSI8LSC1kh7Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
zjqQatZ4ZevfYY5V3kfiyA	4	2016-02-25 00:00:00	I had very low expectations for this restaurant coming in solely because of the name of the restaurant. Then I learned from Yelp that it was a thai restaurant and thought, "oh that was misleading". So remember guys, never judge a restaurant by its name. And always check them out on Yelp beforehand, in case there are secret menu items.\n\nOn my first visit I had to try the secret menu item that everyone raves about: the Islamic noodles. Not sure why it's called Islamic, but I vaguely remember reading that the ingredients may be halal. Do not rely on this though, please check with server. But lets get back to those noodles. Extremely fragrant coconut milk taste in the smooth nutty sauce with a hint of spice. Portions were also huge. Not sure if it's worth the $11 though. A slightly cheaper alternative would be the siam noodles. The sauce tastes very similar just minus the coconut and a very chunky peanut. Also if you have a serious nut allergy I would try to avoid this place. \n\nThey also have a points card! 10 meals and you get a free meal =)\n\nIf you have a small appetite I would recommend you split an appetizer and main with a friend instead of getting 2 separate mains. Unless you want to save it for your next meal. Cause you can do that too.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	kxz6Q2AERQeo9x6nnbHZNg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
ZkAmo2VF_ysrwHToytiRxg	3	2015-11-03 00:00:00	Good location just upstairs. Good atmosphere. Decent food. \n\nIt's great if you're in a hurry to catch a movie or show. One thing I was not a fan of was the communal tables and how the people sitting around you were so close. Practically no privacy. I remembered sitting next to a couple who looked like they were on their first date. \nThe chairs have cubbies for you to put your jacket/bag if you need to.\n\nI was disappointed in the street noodle soup I usually order. The last few time I went, the portion was just right. Right amount of soup, noodles, vegetables and shrimp. However, during my most recent visit, I thought it was way too many noodles. What made it even worse was the girl over at the next table ordered the same thing as me and had the write proportion. I was not so pleased. \nOverall, the food was good and portions were on the heavy side. Thought there was too much noodles on one plate.	4	0	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	nefYrZL3vAdTd9SBPf8kPg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

ZKTa-iqdgcYLwo0BXHCd7Q	3	2017-04-11 00:00:00	The Thai food scene in Toronto has taken off lately. If you are aching for some really good Thai food, this place might not be for you. Having that said, Salad king is a fine place for a bite for run-of-the-mill Thai dishes.\n\nMy favourite dish here is their golden curry which is quite tasty. Prices are cheap and you can get a decent dish for around $12-13 (after tax+tip)\n\nThe place is quite busy on weekends, and it is almost always quite loud. Communal seating in the middle of the restaurant can be charming and annoying at the same time.\n\nA thing I do notice here is that service tends to be slow. Food comes fast once you ordered, but the hard part is waiting for your server....and the same happens when you want to pay. If you are in a rush and think this is a place for a quick meal, you might be disappointed.	2	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	Plqi4pG84PA_vBM8OfDPDg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
zmQ40X0FVvGVTCGlnDwoig	1	2016-05-07 00:00:00	I use to come here a lot for fast Thai food. But lately, I find that their service and the food quality is on the decline. As expected, this place is always busy so the seating isn't the most comfortable. But I find the dinning room extremely loud now - I mean, if I am having a hard time talking to the person seating right across from me, it really is too loud. The service the last few times I have come here has been so so and the last time I was here, I had to constantly wave for my server in order to get service. The quality of the food is not reflective of the prices that they charge. I understand that this is fast Thai food, but I have to say the food quality use to be better. Overall, the past few experiences I had here have not been very good. I don't think I would be coming here any time soon.	2	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	xXyZPAbfQzYTCig7jnZO0A	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

They have some small tables and also communal style seating. \n\nMinus one star because the buckets under the chair can't really hold a purse aaaand a winter jacket, so it gets a bit difficult.

I have never had any problem with Thai spices before since I grew up in South East Asia. I tried their Thai Ice Tea and it tasted awful. There's a cotton candy after taste to it? I've had Thai Ice tea before and it 's definitely not supposed to taste like that. I like the seats though, it makes you feel like you're eating in one of those street hawkers. However, there are better and cleaner Thai place in the GTA so I probably will not come back.	2	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	TwMSmTQjxVWJSJnErBIXlg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I recommend this place for family or a large group of friends. Prices are ok, especially for the serving size. Service is pretty fast, and our server was friendly.

It's not the best Thai food in the city, it's not even the best Thai food in that area.\n\nI'm sure if I was a poor student I'd appreciate their 'No Frills' approach to restauranting (maybe splash a few ice cubes in that water?), but frankly I was left unimpressed.	5	2	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	RD3rboXfUn41QqDXxelpbQ	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
zSxLz3tlVPW4izIPS54IXQ	5	2013-07-11 00:00:00	Ah yes. I remember Salad King back when I was a Ryerson undergrad, back when the restaurant was housed in a heritage building at Yonge and Gould Streets. Didn't take long before I discovered why it was so popular in the campus community. I made it a habit to eat there once a month at best.\n\nThat was before the wall on the building collapsed and their incompetent landlord did nothing about it for a few months, until one night an arsonist finished the job. Fuck's sakes. I think I worked my way up to chili level 10 before that incident ruined everything. And I hadn't even graduated yet.\n\nEnough of nostalgia. Luckily for the Ryerson crowd (and the Yonge-Dundas universe), Salad King eventually opened again across the street from their original location, on the second floor of the building housing a Foot Locker. Never been there since the incident and reopening, until now.\n\nMe and a friend went up the wee stairs and find ourselves in a shiny spacious space that was quite like the old Salad King, with generous real estate dedicated to tables in communal arrangement. It was mid-day July, and the place was barely full--when the school year's running Salad King is often busy all the time.\n\nI had the plain Kari Noodles. Mmm... great. Flavourful. Spicy. Nostalgic. Comfort. Goodness. My buddy, on my advice, ordered the Thai Islamic Noodles. (there used to be a time when this was a rotating 'weekly special', but is now relegated to that mysterious realm of 'secret off-the-menu items'). Got his thumbs up.\n\nThe food comes ripe-hot and fast. The servers sure love to refill your water as quickly as you gulp your cup down. Be sure to always request extra napkins, 'cuz you'll be sweating buckets. Your meal is guaranteed to kick your ass and make your mouth scream... unless I suppose you ordered with a chili level of something mild. Wimp.\n\nI understand much of their stuff is a contemporary take on Thai cuisine, with a big emphasis on hot spiciness, but the food never fails to entertain and satisfy me. And the prices here are still quite affordable--still nothing over $10. Maybe some will regard Salad King as overrated, but you cannot complain about the quality of the food, and for what you are paying, when compared to the crap you could be eating from the crap chain eateries that pollutes this city block (or worse, campus cafeteria grub). Come in a group or come alone, you'll feel quite well here sweating your heart out!\n\n{TTC: From Dundas station, walk north past Gould. Entrance is to the right side of Foot Locker. Nice to know: there is an elevator. Also nice to know: Thai Islamic Noodles.}	1	1	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	7RCz4Ln_FaTvNrdwe251Dg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
ZSxNCXJQ94VuN2ZUxXDOZQ	1	2011-12-09 00:00:00	I went and ordered the pad thai - it was quite tasty. Unfortunately I'm very allergic to eggs - I pointed this out to my server, who then proceeded to serve me pad thai with egg. I ate half of the dish before I spotted the egg - even when I pointed it out he said that it was "impossible". They brought me another dish (egg free) and then charged me for it. I spoke to the manager to try and get the charge removed, but he said that it was "impossible". When I didn't leave a tip, the server asked me what was wrong with my meal. \n\nTerrible service, no respect to allergies whatsoever.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	8iIjpIsn1JYAxC5YEpZ3Lg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

ZWics4ZZVcbOshac9mO0Ow	4	2012-09-28 00:00:00	My nostalgia for this place from when I was a Ryerson student might contribute to my warm feelings for Salad King, but I really do find the food to be pretty good. It's not the absolute best Thai food in the city, but it's tasty, filling and cheap. Mains are under $10 and the portions are huge. Unless you're a really big eater you could even save half for lunch the next day. It's quite casual and, yes, noisy.\nMy favourite dishes are the panang curry, hot chicken with cashew, pattaya chicken and of course the pad thai.\nThe level of spice is made on a per-meal basis, so if you're a relative spice wimp like me, medium will do. The most I ever had was one chili. Friends of mine who like their food hot usually go for 3 chilis, sometimes 5 at the absolute most. Anything past 5 chilis is just crazy, even though it goes up to 20.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	oZbYA8halcQeS-wVKb7xgA	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

So fiiinally, my friend  and I had planned a day downtown.  He had never been to Salad King before and we're kinda into the same food, so I knew he would like it.  I hoped!\n\nIt was a Saturday and we got there around 2:00.  Thankfully it wasn't too packed and we were seated right away.  They have quite a bit of seating to be honest.  It did fill up quite fast though and by the time we were leaving it was packed!  We got served waters right away but it took awhile for our server to come back and take our orders.  I had to find him and flag him down.  He did apologize for the wait. The food also took a bit of time to come out but wow, the goodness of the food, made all these irritated feelings disappear.  I got the golden curry and my friend got the phud thai.  I LOVED both!! I love how the curry comes with a bunch of veggies AND chicken.  The sauce is a peeerfect texture.  Not too thick and not too soupy AND packed with flavout!  It's the perfect amount too.  I wasn't too full but I wasn't left hungry.  I also had a few (a lot) bites of my friend's phud thai and it was sooo much better than I remembered from my college days.  I love the tofu in the dish, as well as, the sauce.  My friend absolutely enjoyed it and said he would get it again.  I'm craving again as I am typing this.  Portion is pretty hefty too.  There's no way I'd be able to finish that in one sitting. \n\nHey Salad King!  Open another location in the Peel Region please!!

_pCLnHp78Cm7BBwG7Capbw	4	2014-11-26 00:00:00	I first came here thinking that this restaurant were known for their salads, hence the name Salad King.  I was so wrong.. It's Thai Food!  Once you go in and go up the flight of stairs, you walk in and this place is usually extremely busy.  There is usually a line up to be seated and they have benches where you sit with randoms, which I feel is too close for comfort sometimes.  But on the other side, if you are lucky, you get the booth seats.  I find it's quite loud and the customer service could be a bit better, but like I always say the ambience and the customer service is always an added bonus.  I've been here a hand full of times, I've tried their Crispy Spring Rolls, Golden Curry with Rice, Hot and Sour Shrimp (Tom Yum Goon) soup, Hot and Soup Mushroom (Tom Yum) soup, and Phud Thai.  The presentation of their food is nice and the taste is delicious from what I've tried.  The price point is affordable and the portion sizes are decent for what you pay for.  I have yet to try their Mango Sticky Rice! Maybe next time I visit I will save some room for dessert.  I'll try it eventually. It's a nice restaurant to go to if you like spice in your food, as you can have as many as 1 to 20 chilis.  I've only had 1-2 chilis, I don't dare to try any hotter, as my tolerance for spicy foods are not the highest.  Anytime you're have cravings for Thai food and I'm in the downtown area, I'd recommend checking out Salad King.. It's in the heart of downtown Toronto, what more is there to ask.	0	0	0	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	mj22XHVEWOe-mRh7GFuD9Q	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg
_T1GrJL4yHFS1bwqg32hRw	4	2016-05-06 00:00:00	First of all, I like the brief menu posted outside the entrance so you get a sense of the price range. I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the place was and how quickly we were seated (I was in a group of 6, and we got there a little after 1pm). The seating was comfortable and the space was big enough for all of us. The decor is colourful and it was nice being beside the window because you get lots of natural light. The staff were also quite friendly. \n\nThere is a lot to choose from the menu. I had a simple wonton soup, my table mates had noodles, and curry. The wontons were pretty good, filled with chicken and shrimp, in a broth with bean sprouts, some pieces of lettuce, and coriander. Not too salty but a bit oily. I was impressed with the portion sizes of what other people ordered, you definitely get a big bowl of food. \n\nSomething I found really interesting was the beer they offered. Two of the people I was with decided to get 2 litres of beer and it basically came in a huge tube with a spout. I thought it was quite impressive. It was a lot for 2 people to handle but we were in a bit of a rush, I'm sure that if we had more time it would have been more enjoyable for them. In the end, they had about 3 or 4 beers each (not sure, I kinda lost count) AND a little bit left over too. \n\nI definitely plan on coming back here to eat again.	1	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	KcHyQDhKslHPkxrFhoNFdg	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

I do have to say I believe my memories clouded the actual experience at Salad King since I've grown up so to speak. The pad thai was decent, but definitely not as good as I remembered! The curry was good too but I felt like I've had richer tasting curries before. It did it job though, fast relatively cheap and to the point. Great for take-out or a quick lunch if you're in the area.	1	1	1	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg	zDpnAox8IftvOfcSkt0i7w	777	-av1lZI1JDY_RZN2eTMnWg

-CrgABcRHdtpDxiIe7fTfw	3	2015-07-15 00:00:00	Considering this is Vegas and that we're in America its very close in taste and smell. But there's a few things which make this Thai restaurant miss the mark for people who know real Thai food. \n\n1. Too sweet. In Thailand. Cooks add sugar to thai food to balance the sour and spice for tourists and it is a sign of a novice chef who is cooking to get a "yum" response and forgetting to aim for a "wow"\n\n2. No fish sauce. What Thai restaurant doesn't have fish sauce on the table? That would have balanced the sugar. \n\n3. Portions. Massive, too big, we walked out feeling sick and only ate half. The flavour was lost in the kilogram of chicken. \n\n4. The prad kapow chicken normally comes with a fried egg on the rice, not the main. \n\n5. Not spicy, I had to add dried chilli flakes which is not Thai chili. I didn't see Thai chilly except for s solid chilly. And everyone knows you chop and dice s chilly to balance the spice. Having a whole one hidden in your meal is a landmine if you're not used to Thai spicy. \n\n6. I asked for the meal to be cooked as close to thai style as possible both in flavour and spice and it was neither flavourful or spicy. \n\nConclusion, if you want to get a hint of Thai food and you're starving then its good. \n\nIf you want to taste Thai food, go somewhere else.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	fhwbtOYfnpd1_-eKM2XN6w	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
-CRpOwLhs1txxtFVKTZpdg	2	2015-08-30 00:00:00	Le Thai is pretty decent, don't get me wrong. I live near Fremont, and it's a convenient place to grab some decent Thai food. Typically, I'd stop by once a week to grab some of their curry (which is pretty mild). The place is a bit crowded during peak hours, but usually isn't too bad. \n\nHowever, lately I've been really busy so I've been ordering it for pick up -- a normal thing for a Thai place. And their absolutely poor service in this aspect has completely lost me as a long time and frequent customer. The first time I was on hold for 20 whole minutes, with someone picking up occassionally, asking what I needed, then after telling them it's carry out, they'd say "One moment" while they try to grab someone. Now, I get that it's busy and they can't always take an order right away, but 20 whole minutes?\n\nThankfully, the manager gave me a free meal, but I rather have just paid for it if I could get my order. \n\nThe second time, the same thing happens. After fifteen minutes on hold, I just hang up. Whatever,  this time it was peak hours, I'll just go down the street to Lotus of Siam who I never had a problem with.\n\nFinally, I try to order a third time on another day. And I get the same treatment. But this wasn't during any crazy peak hours, so they don't have much of an excuse. Fifteen minutes on hold listening to the most annoying hold music ever (8bit, high pitched melodies), I just hung up again.\n\nThere food is decent considering the location. However, just out of principle, I'll never be returning. The amount of time I have to wait on hold with them, is the amount of time it takes round trip to pick it up elsewhere.	2	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	rNvF3ng7h3gMGK134BaNAw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Pretty good food, but the prices are a tad expensive ($10 for Pad Thai, Drunken Noodles, or Pad-See-Ew) but I can understand because of it's location right across from Insert Coins.  However, I do like the food though; it's well made with just the right amount of spice (fyi the spice level is from 1-5 with 2 being medium). If you are going for take out this place usually takes about 20-30 min. to prepare food, but it's worth the wait in my opinion. Highly recommend shrimp Pad-See-Ew and Shrimp Drunken Noodles ($2 extra for shrimp). Great place for lunch!!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	1gEzF_sgGxgIb0w-ONBtBw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
-gORxVnXD2jl5eHQ4MxxUw	5	2017-06-20 00:00:00	My wife and I have been hearing good things about this place for a while and finally decided to try it for ourselves. There is paid on-street parking not too far from the restaurant (if you're driving there and not staying someplace downtown). \n\nIt was well worth the trip. I had the short rib fried rice and my wife had the pad thai, both of which were excellent. We also shared the Waterfall Beef appetizer, which was also delicious. The prices are very reasonable for being downtown and they had some pretty good happy hour specials (M-F from 3-6) too. The service was also good. Everyone was attentive and friendly. \n\nThere are a few downsides to know about if you decide to come try it out. One, it's super small. They have a takeout window up front so you can conveniently get it to go, but I'd be surprised to hear if the max capacity was any more than 40 people. So if you go when it's busy, expect a wait. Two, there are only 2 or 3 tables inside (plus the bar); everything else is outdoor seating. However, I will admit that it was over 100 degrees the day we went and the beer garden (aka an enclosed rear courtyard with a canopy and misters) was surprisingly comfortable.	0	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	uLsdhDdFfPGA9NFsZQN2PA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

-L-NzocNdlfK4dfiUdNIEA	4	2015-04-23 00:00:00	I love Le Thai.  I've been going regularly since they opened and I'm always quick to introduce friends to the place.  Another one of those restaurants that sort of hides in plain sight, it sits quietly next to the Commonwealth on Fremont Street between 6th and Las Vegas Blvd.\n\nThe menu is relatively small, but has something for most fans of Thai food.  Everything is cooked fresh, the food is delicious, and you can choose how how you'd like your dish to be.  Portions are just the right size for lunch and dinner.  If you order a bowl of soup though, you may end up taking some home.  You truly get a bowl of soup, but it's worth it.\n\nThe wait staff is super friendly.  Seating is limited (some indoors and some covered on the patio in the back), and a little bit at the bar, so get there when they open, or be prepared for a small wait.  Even if you have to wait though, seats seem to open up quick enough so that the wait isn't usually too bad.  And for those interested, you can see into the kitchen!\n\nIf you don't have something already in mind, try the Awesome Flat Noodles, Ga Pow or Pad Prik with a Thai Iced Tea.  The Cucumber Salad is a fantastic side dish.  Just go.  You'll thank me later.	1	0	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We found Le Thai, a small and casual gem. Tiny dining area, so we had to eat outside in jackets in a screened patio area with heaters( a small inconvenience). I eat Thai often(NY, NJ), but this was one of the best and even slightly unique. The Penang curry tasted like homemade- mild and creamy, and transparent flavors(no mystery sauces). Kee Mao was not sticky like other places but actually juicy and refreshing with all the veggies. I also had a salad, I think pork with lettuce and dressing...forgot the name, but was nice and lemony. However, they missed the soooo delicious peanuts. They should consider adding them for another layer of flavor and texture.\nThai iced tea could have used less brewing or steeping time, it was a bit bitter.\nThumbs up Le Thai!\nOh, a little fun fact: all their menu sections are prefixed with Le. So it will say Le Beverage, Le other Beverage, Le Salad. I found it amusing and nice.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	yw1mAnwlKCigBvEcZkGbbA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
-vF96zi0mLhdIg37B_aYRg	4	2016-01-11 00:00:00	This place has a really cool feel to it as it is located near the arts district in DownTown Las Vegas. There is usually a line if you come during lunch and dinner times because the restaurant is small and is pretty well known. They offer pretty genuine Thai Food with superb service. Every time I have been here the waitresses have been amazing. I usually sit outside in the back patio. They have heaters and the patio is enclosed so do not worry about getting too cold.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n1.) Waterfall Beef (Appetizer)- This tender beef is served with sticky rice and waterfall sauce. The beef is perfectly cooked: tender, juicy and clean. My favorite part of the dish in the sauce it comes with. I do not know how they make the sauce but Im guessing its a mixture of vinegar, fish sauce and heaven! haha. I wanted to pour it on everything!\n\n2.) Thom Kha Kai (Soup)- This lemon grass coconut soup is a must try! I can't quite find the words to explain the taste but if you like sweet, tangy with a bit of spice, it'll be the perfect dish for you.\n\n3.) Padt Thai (Noodles)- These rice noodles with stir-fried egg, green onion, bean sprouts and crushed peanuts, and cilantro left me craving for more!\n\n4.) Drinks- Thai Tea or Singha (signature Thai beer)\n*The owner's son is pretty cool too ;P*	2	1	3	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	CeQh69cx7UEcAcqM-zFMuw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The food was quick and I was soo happy we stopped in. The chili lime peanuts they give as a filler while we waited was good too I actually added them to my noodles.

I had the chance to try three different dishes here and none disappointed. \n\nThe sweet/savory interplay that is the Awesome Noodles (and they live up to the name) or the lip-smacking goodness of the Braised Short Rib Fried Rice (even the long name won't derail your enjoyment of this dish-my favorite-) Its all good in this joint that is frequented by both tourists and locals. \n\nAlso of special mention is the Pork Jerky appetizer. A plate of fried pork goodness served with a sauce that is everything thai food should be. Mix both in the side of white rice and you might be tempted to forgo an entrée and have two servings of this dish. \n\nWhether you're a local looking for a place to add to you favorites list or a tourist looking for a true taste of Las Vegas, Le Thai should not be missed.

This is located across the street from Insert Coins in Downtown Vegas. They have happy hour from 3-6pm Monday-Friday and Saturday from 11am-4pm which includes pork jerky, wings, chicken satay, waterfall beef and of course, alcohol. They have Stella, Chang, San Miguel beer, vodka, rum, tequila, gin, wine, Spiked Thai Iced Tea and a drink interestingly called Ladyboy Cocktail. Since getting hammered while wearing a dress before Les Miserables might not be such a great idea, I didn't partake in happy hour which means I'd have to come back. I had non-spiked Thai Iced Tea instead.\n\nWe got Pad Thai with chicken and shrimp spicy 3/5, Garlic Fried Rice with chicken spicy 3/5, Spicy Eggplant with tofu and Short Rib Fried Rice. We finished our meal with an order of Roti.\n\nPad Thai:\nWhat I noticed was that it doesn't come with crushed peanuts but it still tastes good. Great flavor. Spicy, lightly salty and sweet - the classic Thai flavor combination. 4/5\n\nGarlic Fried Rice:\nI should have ordered this dish at spicy 2/5 instead. I missed out on the garlic taste and my nose was running. My bad. It's a delicious dish though and I'm sure I would have tasted flavor elevations had my tastebuds not been burned. 4/5\n\nSpicy Eggplant:\nIn an attempt to eat something healthy with all the meat and carb dishes we got, we decided to get a veggie dish and add tofu instead of meat. Tasty dish with bell peppers, onion in Thai chili sauce. 3.5/5\n\nShort Rib Fried Rice:\nThe best dish we tried. Tender, juicy shreds of mildly sweet short rib...sooo good. I couldn't stop eating this. 5/5\n\nRoti:\nNutella spread on roti topped with egg drizzled with condensed milk and dusted with powdered sugar. It's sweet but not overly sweet. I love Nutella so I was bound to like this dessert. The fried egg on top cuts the sweetness of the dish. 4/5\n\nGreat service. They have indoor and outdoor seating. They get real busy by around 6pm. The prices weren't bad.	4	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Although this place is really small and you can practically be apart of the conversation of the people at the table next you I still did enjoy my meal. I ordered a Thai Ice Tea which I didn't see on the menu but was happy that they had it. It was good but not great. Could have been a little sweeter. As for the food we ordered the pork jerky whit sticky rice. The sauce this dish came with was incredibly delicious. Tangy, Spicy, and lots of cilantro. We also order the garlic beef fried rice which was also delicious and full of flavor. Everything on the table was level 3 from 0-5 on their spice meter and in my opinion was just the perfect amount to make me have to take a few sips of water and want to come back for more until it was all done.

The reason I gave Le Thai a 4 star vs 5 star is due to the service I received there today.  I am not an unreasonable or unpleasant customer as I have waited tables in my college years and know it's not an easy job however:\n1.  Our waiter took his break in the middle of our visit and failed to properly hand us off to another waiter. \n2. During the break we ordered soup (which is typically large enough for 4 adults - we ordered 2 of these) and when the soup was brought to our table, no additional bowls for serving everyone, none were provided.  We had to ask twice to get enough for everyone.\n3.  When spooning out the soup into a bowl, some of it spilled on my hand and I received a 2nd degree burn.  Despite informing my waiter (once he returned from his break) and receiving ice to help with the pain, no apologies were offered and I would have thought at least the manager would stop by the table - nope.  \n\nBottom line:\n\nFood is amazing - get take out or delivery.  :)	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	JKDVAk8TZqqa6yl-vcQC7Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The atmosphere here is laid back cool and the people here are welcoming.  \n\nThis place also has the second best Phad Thai I've ever had.  To be honest with you,  I had a bowl of it early Thursday afternoon and I almost went back to get more for dinner but I resisted...until lunch the next day.  I seriously couldn't get it off my mind.\n\nThe food here is great.  $13 will get you a plenty big portion that has that unique mix of flavors I want in Phad Thai.  I ordered the spice level 4 but Ashley the bartender recommended 2 ("mild") out of 5 with some extra chilies on the side.  Long story short, the next day I easily handled the level 4 ("spicy") and the next time I'm going all the way to 5 ("Thai spicy"),\n\nI know most people going to downtown Las Vegas usually stay under the protective canopy of The Fremont Street Experience, which is a blast.  But for those adventurous souls that like to step out of the box and explore - you owe it to yourself to stop here and get yourself a bowl of Phad Thai.\n\nTip:  This place is BUSY so be prepared to be on a wait at lunch and dinner times.	8	3	6	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	GX4R9SIz3JsRrQdqzYP9bA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I'm pretty sure that quote was referring to spicy food but I digress.\n\nI personally enjoy any opportunity to find my way downtown and more importantly to try new eateries.  Le Thai has been on my list for a while.\n\nEnthusiastic and hungry we approached the hostess stand only to be told there was a 60-minute wait *insert pouty face here*. No problem, we killed time next door until our seats were ready.\n\nI must have looked unusually disappointed or totally starving because not even 15 minutes later we were being paged that our seats were ready! SCORE!\n\nAmbiance can be best described as a hole-in-the-wall reminiscent of most restaurants in NYC (or Chicago).  It's cool without being smug about it.  \n\nMost importantly the food: excellent portion sizes, bold flavors, spice level was right on point. Their spice chart is 1-4 and we went with 2's all across the board. My friend was sweating, my nose was running but man oh man was it worth it. \n\nI can recall Le Thai not taking reservations in the past, but since they do currently, I highly recommend taking that extra step in securing your seating.

I'm not talking about the wait to be seated, I'm talking from the time we ordered until we got our food...over 30 minutes. My buddy was there with me and we both ordered, when his food was ready they just put it to the side to wait for mine, needless to say his food was not hot and was only warm.  This place is over priced and after eating less than half my food I gave up and just threw the rest away	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	U9iQTp3z141YCujZcwSbMQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

If you're sick of the overpriced, gaudy strip experiences then this is the place. Ordered the pad kee mow with chicken: service was prompt and friendly; noodles perfectly cooked. You can designate spiciness on a 1-5 scale. I'm not very adventurous with spiciness but I like some kick. So 2 was perfect.

I am yet to eat here since I've been back (I've definitely had my fill for a while), but I'm already looking forward to it.\n\nMaybe I just didn't have the greatest experiences in Thailand, or maybe thai food in Thailand just is what it is. \n\nI will tell you though Le thai was one of the reasons why I was excited for thai food in Thailand, and yet nothing compared. \n\nThe Pad Se Ewu, Awesome Flat noodle, and Shrimp Stir Fry are among my favorite dishes here. \n\nIf you want to try something different and hearty, opt for the Tri Colored Shrimp Noodle Curry. Usually on the special board, but if not they can usually make it. It's like the Thai version of Shrimp Alfredo!

They have an excellent selection of wine/beer/cocktails and very reasonably priced. Crab rangoons are some of the best I've ever had, perfect cream cheese/crab ratio. Shrimp Pad Thai was a little too heavy on the cilantro for our liking, it really overpowered the dish. There weren't enough peanuts either. Also tried the Garlic Fried Rice with Tofu which was incredible. Spice level 2 was perfect for both of these dishes. Can't wait to go back and try more items!	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	jJtMKVIUzdDG4xagIOSraA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
1UjkP2PRtcb_TepSrT-oSw	5	2013-05-24 00:00:00	Le Thai is some of the best Thai food in our humble valley. I have tried most of the dishes and apps, and they range from solid to absolutely delicious. Start with the pork jerky - it is paired up with some rice and an excellent sauce. I have enjoyed every dish on the menu, but I will always favor the curry. The spicy eggplant is also dynamite. The decor is simple, but pleasant, with a small indoor room and a large outdoor area in the back. My only knocks are the service (commonplace for Asian restaurants) and the absence of wine glasses. Still, neither of those digs are enough to warrant anything other than the full five stars.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	JqfQCJlKeiALcL3v0bYjAw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Unfortunately working in Downtown doesn't give me much options in terms of food.\n\nI went to Le Thai once and ordered Awesome Flat Noodle with Shrimp. I really had high hopes because of the great reviews and the $15 price. \n\nThe portion was so so and the noodles were salty. I wanted to like it, but it was just not good enough and OVERPRICED.\n\n3 weeks later, i had my noodle craving and decided to try Le Thai again. I ordered over the phone for take out. The food was ready when I get there and the server was friendly and sweet. \n\n(So, my rating is solely based on their food.)\n\nI ordered Pad Kee Mow (chicken option, $13) this time. Again, the noodles were so SALTY! I thought my taste buds were too sensitive, so I asked my husband to try the noodles. He thought the noodles were too salty too. The ingredients were nothing to write home about; minced chicken with some veggies. I was so disappointed. If this wasn't a take out, I would have returned it and gave my comment to the chef. \n\nMy husband's Lunch Special Green Curry was ok. But I had such bad experience with their noodles that I just won't go back.  Sorry, it's you. Hopefully you can improve your noodle dishes soon.	4	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	2sXXAtizk1oAQdCC_fyCmg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
1wiIU-MFeJ7unWzJVVbeaA	3	2012-12-09 00:00:00	Had an interesting experience here. Met up with a few friends to this small but apparently very popular thai restaurant next to Commonwealth (the new hot bar in downtown Vegas) and The Griffin. We got a table fairly quickly ordered drinks and food, which both came fast. The hostess was a cold cold girl who seemingly had little love of life. Waiter was nice guy. Food was solid. Nothing to write home about but what do you expect in a fun thai place like that?\n\nThings got a bit interesting when 6 others associated with our group wanted to join and take over the table next to us. Unfortunately there was a line. The awful, ostentatious girl sitting next to me who frequented the toilet several times during our meal offered to pay the bill of the large table next to us if they got up immediately and gave the table to her friends that had arrived. The level of excess in this one was beyond what I had seen and that is saying a lot. Obviously this resulted in a back and forth with the dragon lady, our waiter, and this spoiled brat who was used to getting everything her way. I was embarrassed to be associated. She did eventually get her wish. My friend and I wanted nothing to do with these people so quickly got the bill. I am not fully sure, but I am fairly confident that our waiter stole one the twenties I put on the pill and acted as if I had only put one twenty in the check. Again cannot prove it but I know that I put two down (my friend can verify). Oh well. \n\nOverall mixed experience but is a fun place in a good location if you are going out downtown.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	91NoyWzCcVM0hLkp-Ev4Tw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Side note: Downtown Vegas is so getting so out of this world awesome!\n\nReally..the only downside to this place is that it's rather small and so there's almost always a sizable wait at peak times. I like the service, the decor is not out of this world but always makes me comfortable and the food is solid. The menu is short and sweet and a large number of dishes can be made vegetarian. We like their spring rolls, tom yum soup, ginger fried rice, massaman curry, basil noodles and awesome noodles. \n\nThe drinks menu is pretty solid with some interesting cocktail concoctions and Asian beer options.

They have a check-in deal for one free hug. Thought that was legit. Need to go back and redeem at some point.\n\nWent with some folks I had basically just met, and we ordered a number of dishes and just shared. Everything was soooo good. I couldn't believe it.

It was a little after 8:00pm, we were seated by a friendly guy. \n\nWe immediately placed our order, as we are regulars there and we were starving, the server, an older hispanic woman took our order. We recieved our 2 beers promtly. 20 minutes later she came back to check on us, we asked about our food, she said it was coming. \n\n45 minutes later we asked about our food again, our server never placed our order, then she frantically tried to put it in without aknowloging what happened.\n\nThe people that were seated after us were eating their meal. There were only 3 tables total, including us, so they were not super busy. I don't understand it.\n\nWe were starving, we tried to leave but she acted offended that we wanted to leave. Took forever with the bill. we had to look at a menu so we could calculate how much it would be, so we could leave cash and get out of there. She handed it to us as we were walking out, there was already cash on the table.\n\nShe never apologized, never brought our food, oh but she did charge us for the beers. I think the owners of this place are great and the food is awesome, but the staff needs quite a bit of work. When they're not there to supervise, service sucks.\n\nIf she would have apologized, comped our beers or simply brought us a free appetizer we would have been satisfied. Instead, I'm still upset and writting this review. We went to Mob Bar, our food was served in less than 10 minutes.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	vj-7ZELwpQDOyVB0nIwyLg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The host was very welcoming and the restaurant had a very inviting curb appeal.  We had a party of 4 and we were welcomed at our table by a very good waitress with a bowl of spicy and sweet peanuts that held us over as we reviewed the menu.  \n\nWe sat on the back patio under some beautiful murals and attractive lighting.  The music was very cool and had a nice reggae vibe.  \n\nWe ordered crab rangoon to start which were wonderful and had some drinks as well.  For entrees we had pad thai with chicken, eggplant with shrimp, and yellow curry with tofu.  Each of these plates was really tasty and was a perfect amount of food for four.\n\nWe sat down at about 5:15pm on a Friday and the tables were already filling up.  Get there early to enjoy this gem located in the up and coming East Fremont District.	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	T6a5PsMEuImhIcV7h5A3mQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Unless you are a glutton for punishment, do not order a dish with spicy  #5 (spice levels are 1-5, five being the hottest). I love spicy food, but when I ordered the awesome noodles with spice level 5, it was insane. It took me three days to eat. Very good though.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	lyffFwG3BNy0YMxOe1dX5Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Very nice bartender took our order and help me figure out what to pick. \n\nThe space overall is small and the decor very eclectic. Outdoor seating is located in front and part of the back seating is open as well. Take out is offered thru a window in the front outdoor seating area. \n\nThe food is really good. I had the short rib fried rice with 3 (hotness) and it was prefect! Hot but not overpoweringly hot.

We had several appetizers which included the wings and spring rolls. We had the tom yum, garlic fried rice and pad thai. All of the food we had was EXCELLENT!!! I specially like that you have an option of getting tofu with any of the entrees. If you like ginger we strongly recommend the ginger soda. They also send you a text message when your table is ready. This is our go to place for thai food. The service is great too.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	_hjOmtm2BgeWqwJFqHDiwA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
3orYvJmVoP1CaX1xty_dmQ	4	2014-08-26 00:00:00	I really enjoyed this Thai place and will be coming back when I'm in town.  The bartender Mercy and one of her assistants, Andrew, were so very friendly.  They made me feel very welcome.  When they asked how I was liking my food, you could tell that they really had an interest in me being pleased.  I like that kind of invested interest.\n\nI shared my meal with some friends so I had three entree's.  \n- The Pad Thai was a nice rice dish with a complex dash of sweet and sour.  I ordered it about a 3 star.  I could have gone to a 5, I'm sure.  I was a newbie.  If you like hot, start with a 4 and go from there.\n- The short rib stir fried rice was good, but I wouldn't go there for that.  It was my least favorite of the three meals, though, I enjoyed it.\n- My favorite was the Three Color Curry.  That was wicked good.  It was a very flavorful soupy curry dish that you will need to mix your rice with (stir fried or white).\n\nThe unsung part of the meal was the pickled jalapeno's.  Apparently the pickling process makes the peppers sweet and the juice just blended well with all three of the meals that I added it to.\n\nI'm a fan... I'll go back.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	OZXTNjJANhm4TUlhiGr4yg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
3OUtvfvQCOoSAgDds3HdYQ	1	2015-01-17 00:00:00	Used to love this place but I dont think myself or the other 15 guests I was with will be going back. \n\nWe had a reservation for 10-15 people and were not told by the people we made the reservation anything about the potential of us being forced into a preset menu. We asked if we could split into two seperate parties to avoid complications as we weren't prepared for this and we were told no. \n\nThe manager came up to us as we waited for our table outside and asked us to pick out everything we wanted to order then (rather than at the table where we could discuss as a group with all of our guests) so it started out awkward from there. \n\nWe asked how much this would cost and we were told $25 per person. There was enough food brought out for everyone but only a few different options and we continually had to ask for more rice as only 3 (very) tiny containers of sticky rice were brought out for 15 dining guests and curry (that you put over rice) was the majority of what we had gotten. \n\nThe server told us that we were only able to seperate the check 4 ways but I have used that POS system and you can split it as many times as wanted. We didn't want the check to be difficult, we were willing to split even ways but having 15 guests for a birthday was really hard to narrow down to 4 different checks. Many of our guests walked across the street to the casino El Cortez to pull out cash as we were trying to not be "that table." \n\nWhen we received our bill it was over $650. We were charged an 18 percent included gratiuty (I am a 20% tipper but this is actually illegal now in Las Vegas and as a server I would not add my gratuity on such a large party that is already infuriated with me.) when we asked to be charged by individual plates rather than family style as they charged us a $400 family style charge that we were not aware of, they also increased the tip to 20%. I would never think that the server should get the short end of the stick in these situations but frankly he acted as if we were completely annoying for being concerned.	3	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	_ijyPpSVoZwu6pko7-Ucxg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Fellow attorney asked to meet me there for lunch because he is in love with the awesome noodles.  He admitted that they were pretty awesome.  I had the chicken pad thai.  Woo!  Way to break me in.  3 on the spicy scale of 1-5 was SPICY for this white girl.  I loved every minute of it.  \nWe met there right at 11:30 when they opened.  By the time we left an hour later, there was not any room to sit there.  People were waiting for our table.  This is unheard of for the downtown area.  (It was kinda funny that we ran into his mom there eating with a coworker!  Apparently, he has verbalized his love of the awesome noodles to everyone.) \nI am interested in returning and sampling more of their menu.	0	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	kWj6AdUtkvbzhdsqRifwLQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

3WXc3XaDgPlBzeLa5XPtaQ	4	2014-09-14 00:00:00	Yum! \n\nWhen I think of food in Vegas, the only thing that comes to mind is something that's cheap and bad for you. This last time in Vegas, I decided to use Yelp to guide me to a place of deliciousness.\n\nMy friends and I stayed on Fremont this time. That deserves it's own review, but I'm here to heap some more praise on Le Thai. My experience here was great. It's so busy that they have reservations... I called and was told it would be a 1 hour wait. After giving the lady my number, I immediately received a text and was told I could download an app to see my progress. \n\nAbout an hour later, I notice that the app still shows there's a 30 minute wait. We ended up walking to the restaurant and were told they were very busy, and the app was correct. The hostess was very apologetic, but offered our party of four to sit against a bar area. We were hungry, so we agreed.\n\nThe service was quick! And our server was very nice and attentive. \n\nWe started off with an order of some delicious wings and chicken skewers. The wings were delicious and came with a great dipping sauce. The chicken skewers were delicious as well... Moist, tender, and had a great flavor.\n\nFor our main dishes we got the Pad See Ew, Yellow Curry, and Drunken Noodles! The three dishes were so yummy! The level of spiciness that we ordered was spot on. The dishes were delicious and the food came out piping hot. \n\nMy only complaints are this...\n\n1.) GIVE PEOPLE WHITE RICE with their meals. It's fuckin' cheap. You want to mix white rice with your food. Yes, it came with the curry, but that's not enough. DON'T BE CHEAP. Your food is already expensive as it is, and it's JUST thai food... \n\n2.) PUT SOME FAN/AIR in the back patio. It was like 200 degress back there, and the only thing that kept me from dying was the cold water and cold beer I had. \n\nOverall a good thai food place. I would definitely return.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	_7A9uRTB8MEUGrloUdo8Fw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

3zKvI6XCSRNlJl_S1P5LnA	3	2012-10-06 00:00:00	I heard rave reviews about Le Thai and decided to give it a try on a random Friday night. I am admittedly picky about Thai food, so I never get my hopes up. Since this is a new "it" place downtown there was an hour wait, even at 8:30 on a Friday. So we settled in outside and took advantage of the fantastic people watching. When we first put our names on the list there was a table for 2 open but they immediately put a "reserved" sign on it. Wouldn't you know that nobody showed up for an hour so we ended up with that table, mildly irritating! \n\nOnce we were seated we were immediately brought water. I love me some water so I was really nervous with the tiny glasses they use, but they also bring a carafe so you can refill often. We also got a Thai tea and were pleased with the really large portion. We put in our order for the Thai style wings right away. The wings were fantastic! They were incredibly crispy on the outside and came with a spicy Siracha ranch sauce. I always go for Pad Thai with beef and this was no exception. The Pad Thai was good, but it was very different. It seemed almost like a stir fry with all components added, chopped, and completely mixed in the dish. The beef was not as tender as I would have liked, nothing like chewy meat. My husband had the awesome noodles with beef. They were good noodles, I don't know about awesome. They had a strong garlic and fish sauce flavor. They were thicker noodles which was nice and comforting. \n\nThe wings were fantastic, but the Pad Thai was just not for me. The service was actually great, despite the other reviews I read. In my opinion, this is a trendy downtown restaurant so be ready to wait and dine in a noisy hipster environment.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	p9TNT6pNKRuvBSzNf27JkQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

4Byw_DF_vETvvPkAY19Zrg	3	2014-04-27 00:00:00	I wanted to love this place; I really did. But the slow service and so-so food really let me down.\n\nWe stopped in on a busy Saturday afternoon. We were told the wait would be 15 minutes, and the hostess took our cell number and said she'd call when our table was ready. (This sounded like a great plan!) So we walked around the Fremont East area for awhile and then returned to the restaurant to have a drink at the bar.\n\nWe told the bartender we were still waiting for a table, and he told us the waitress would get us when our table was ready. Not sure what the disconnect was, but we sat at the bar for more than half an hour while people who came in off the street sat down to eat. (Yes, some of them came in after a phone call, but I watched others who just stepped up and immediately got a table.) I figured we were waiting for a table in the small dining area and not a table in the bar area, and that's why we were still waiting. But, no. When our table was ready, it was a table two feet away from us in the bar area. (Why we couldn't have just sat there initially, I don't know.)\n\nWe tried to order a bottle of wine while we were waiting, but they were out of our selection. So my husband got a beer and I had a water. When our table was finally ready, we had to cash out at the bar first, which was also kind of annoying. But I still had high hopes, because I had heard the food was great.\n\nI love Thai food, and when I go to a new place, I always order shrimp pad thai to gauge it against other restaurants. This one was just so-so, although the portion was large enough that the $15 price tag was somewhat warranted. My husband fared better with his beef short rib fried rice, which I must admit was delicious (and I'm not a fan of short ribs). But it took a LONG time to get our food--as well as the beers that we ordered with it--and our waitress never came back to check on us, so we never got to order a second round of drinks like we had intended.\n\nAll in all, we spent $50 and an hour and a half for three beers and a mostly forgettable lunch. I hope other diners have a better experience than we did, because the menu showed promise (and the short rib fried rice was nearly worth the wait). But I think next time I'll drive the extra few miles to Lotus of Siam, where I know the food is always excellent, even if I have to wait.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Very nicely done and it makes it a little more romantice with my gf.  Place does get crowded, but hey good food means you going to have to wait just a bit.  \n\nI came here with a group, everything was already arranged and yes it was very well presented.  We started with two apps (veggie eggrolls and wings).  Loved the wings and their dipping sauce (informed that it was just hotsauce and ranch).  The jerky with sticky rice and thai sauce, heaven.. Tiny bits of beef was very tender.  Because we were in a group the spiciness was set to mild.  Poo, I love hot stuff! Amazing noodles and pad thai were very solid choices.  I thought that it tasted just good, but could have been better if i was spicy.  Should go alone next time.  Another great entree is the chicken curry.  How good was it?  The guy across from me is a graduate from culinary school and he acutally asked for the rest of it to take home.  Enough said.  \n\nNow for you drinking folks.  There's quite a selection on thai beer from what I heard.  I don't drink, but most of the guys at the table did.  They got quite a bit that night.  \n\nDesserts! Fried bananas, a bit too much wrapping around the banana but then it works well since condensed milk is poured onto it.  Now the really appealing and interesting item was this egg cake with nutella baked.. Sorry don't remember what it was called.  Surprisingly, it wasn't really that bad once you start chewing.  I thought the egg was going to be weird but it was more like a flan with nutella.\n\nDef will be back.  Yes I'll have to take my gf, but I want my noodles spicy!\n\nSide note: parking is difficult, but there is street parking around the corner on both ends.

I ordered the Short Rib Fried Rice, which is as advertised as a house specialty. The meat was some of the softest and most flavorful meat I've had, and they provide plenty of meat per plate. My boyfriend ordered the Awesome Noodles, extra spicy, and they delivered on the extra spicy. \n\nOverall, I'd recommend this place to anyone looking for some delicious Thai food in the Vegas area.	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	VNJpqKAAzui0W0vTQbNs0A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It tastes good but these dishes done properly should.  Also, because Thai food generally tastes good when you are drunk or hung (the perfect combo of grease, salt and carbs), it serves the target demographic well. Not trying to be negative - I've had several perfectly fine meals here - just giving a realistic assessment.  Sober diners and those who know food should adjust expectations accordingly.  On the plus side, service has always been great.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	YuABJc2x2pSDUw2HD6bzWQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
4m5NdUk7ozLrlNsSZ8OOrA	4	2012-02-28 00:00:00	Finally a decent spot to grab a bite in FE (Fremont East, act like ya know). While I argee with some of my peers that while some of the portions could be larger for some of the dishes, others are spot on. Definitely enjoy the ambiance and great for a quick, informal date or group get together. Some nights have a DJ playing usually some sexy house music and the last time I visited the DJ was accompanied by a gentleman playing the bongos, adding extra, organic touch to the music. Service can be spotty as the night progresses and tables begin to fill. My last time out I noticed a couple leaving in a bit of frustration as the were largely ignored. \n\nOverall though its 3.5 but I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt, because unless Streats is going on its sorta slim picking for us foodies in the immediate area. But in comparison to the other Thai restaurants in Vegas there certainly are better.	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	E19IMURE4WEoCnvDx-bylg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

4v294zpjrRIgm34wjA_Pyg	5	2012-03-05 00:00:00	This place is vegan boozer heaven.  Le Thai has recently made most of their menu (except curries* and pad thai) vegan! And they serve beer and liquor.  And they are open late! And they have a patio!\n!!!!\nSo, the Massaman curry actually is vegan, and it's delicious.  As are the Awesome Noodles, which totally live up to their name.  Just remember to ask for your dish with no fish sauce or egg.  The spring rolls were quite good as well.  Wash it all down with my favorite new drink, the Lady Boy (Thai whiskey with gingerale and lime).  They also have a rum-based drink that tastes EXACTLY like grape kool-aid.  \n\nIt is very small inside, but has a good sized patio.  This will be a wonderful place to eat for the 3 weeks a year that vegas is neither too chilly or blazing hot.  Kidding! I'm a trooper, sort of.  And they have heat lamps out there now, so really just do it.  \n\nThe menu is small, but everything is tasty, so who cares?  I can't wait to get back and more things. \n\nThis is a really great addition to downtown, and a much needed source of vegan-friendly late night eats.	5	0	3	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	C-DfyTJjLP6PDP4P__TsBw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The restaurant seemed a bit small but I love the fact they had out door patio seating with air misters to keep us comfortable. We were seated immediately. We were greeted my our waiter promptly. we ordered an appetizer/egg rolls and the short rib friend rice and the vegetable sir fry with chicken. our Appetizer came out shortly after we ordered and when we took a bite into the egg rolls the center was cold almost frozen...was a bi disappointed on the appetizer. we sent it back. it seemed as though it took awhile to get our food. 35 min or so. no complaints tho the place was busy for 9pm on a Thursday night. once the food was received the short rib fried was was excellent and our stir fry just as good...our waiter seemed very busy and did not return to check on us for awhile. no drink refills until we asked for our check. our experience here was so/so. we liked our entrees so we may return to give Le Thai another shot and try other things on the menu.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	G3L-DWwDiVUcXcKNo4LYNA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

55v8dz2ODDm3qIy5_wYx3A	5	2015-06-22 00:00:00	I've been exploring Thai food as a relatively recentish resident of Las Vegas. We didn't have a ton of Thai places back home in Tucson, so coming here, there is a crazy amount! Le Thai is the best I've had in Vegas/Henderson so far.\n\nWe took a seat on the patio, hoping it wasn't as hot as it was outside there, and they had misters going it was a very comfortable temperature. The patio has beautiful murals and lights. It feel like you aren't in the middle of the somewhat grungy area of Fremont. It's peaceful and eclectic.\n\nI am a sucker for Tom Kha soup at ANY restaurant but its always a pleasant surprise to see it done super well. And the Short Rib Fried Rice and the Fried Egg Rolls were super good. Even though the prices are a little higher than the dirt cheap usual prices of Thai restaurant, once you take a bite you realize why. It is so, so good! \n\nTom Kha Soup: Me and my husband ALWAYS share this whenever we get Thai food. He hates the mushrooms, I pass on the larger pieces of chicken and it works out perfectly. This soup was the best I've had. We got a 3/10 on the spice scale. Not looking to die today. And it was the perfect amount of spice. Didn't make your face fall off but also you still got a tiny kick. But if you are a fan of spicy, go ahead and order a high number. I'm sure its fantastic.\n\nFried Egg Rolls & Plum Sauce: Yum. I'm always a sucker for an egg roll. Those and Crab Rangoons are my favorite when it comes to fried apps. These were veggie only. And they were delicious. Not super greasy, as they should be and not flaming hot. As in, we could actually take a full on bite right when they got to the table. Which is how it should be done!\n\nShort Rib Fried Rice: This was a new one for me. I'm a big fan of fried rice and short rib just sounded good. Oh and it was. There was so much flavor in this one. And the short rib wasn't too fatty, which can ruin short rib for me. Every big piece of short rib was fully flavorful meat and not all stretched out with fat. There was a great amount of short rib in the rice too. It was very balanced. I would definitely share this as an entree and try other stuff on the menu like appetizers. That way you get to try a little of each. \n\nI will definitely be returning to this place and tying some other menu items. Maybe some noodles next time. Who knows? I'm sure it will be delicious.	3	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	HUX1p0y71x_j-5VWz4tB0w	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

57aV8GjQPBaqbuMK--D90w	5	2015-03-02 00:00:00	Okay- I have a problem. I will publicly admit that I ate at Le Thai 3x last week for lunch because I am addicted to their Drunken Noodles w/ beef. Long ago, I fell in love with the Drunken Noodles at Ayara Thai in Los Angeles, and I did not think I would ever find Thai food I could love as much as that. Well, good thing, since I don't live there anymore, but this is even BETTER!!!!! Goodness gracious it is so good. It's sweet, it's spicy, the noodles are fresh, the beef is flavorful and tender....I get medium level spice and then just go to town on the Sriracha. 10 minutes later my nose is running and my ears are clogged, but it hurts so good!!!!!	3	2	3	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	bkcWR-bVxx4wjRkjZdUfNQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The meal was absolutely delicious.The Drucken Noodles were made to perfection and the heat was spot on. The service was impeccable, quick, and friendly. Even though it is located In Downtown Las Vegas /Fremont Street it should not detour you from stopping by and trying out this place. Small yet quant it has a atmosphere where you can go relax and enjoy a great meal. The  cocktails were also up to par. The Spring Rolls as well as the Fried Wings were amazing.

If she said Hello at least we were able to notice her and schedule our lunch. Instead, she yelled to my daughter half way inside. Of course I said NO, when she asked if I wanted to schedule lunch. There are more better Thai Restaurants in Vegas, one is Arawan in E. Sahara, 5 star, highly recommended.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Slt0M3XHgtMXzJ7TYXbgNw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

5r8G_q797G4l3xqMwfL4uQ	4	2012-08-22 00:00:00	Yes Indeed I am a Fan of Le Thai. \n\nI find myself finding ways to be near Le Thai on East Fremont Downtown, just in case I get hungry.. I love this little Thai spot. It's definitely a more fused-up style of Thai cooking, hence the 'Le' :] but I love everything about it. I have never dined anywhere other than on the back patio under the mist sprayers, and even in 100+ degree heat, it is really comfortable back there. \n\nWith all the items you would expect from a Thai menus - like Pad Thai and Panag Curry, Le Thai also incorporates some other delicious flavors.  My personal favorite is the Spicy Eggplant with Shrimp. It's. Really. Delicious. \n\nThe only thing that I find is difficult for me to grasp is they're spicy seasonings. I can handle, and do enjoy some heat in my Asian-Style favorites, but the spice is often not consistent at Le Thai. I usually get a '4' out '5' when they ask for a preference in spice level.. Sometimes it's perfect, and sometimes it's not spicy at all, and then other times I can't even eat it it's so hot.  \n\nI have been told that they use 'Ghost Pepper' (look it up..its a really HOT pepper,) on the hotter end of the scale. This may be why it's sometimes hard to handle. The remedy for me, has been to order a level 3 and spice it up with the peppers and chili sauce they bring to the table. Then it's perfect for me every time. \n\nIf you haven't tried it, and love Thai Food.. I think you will be very happy with Le Thai. Everything is fresh and the staff is great and the prices are right. See you there!	3	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	VpqKcpEq2rgoS7Jlb_Aj1Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Their bloody Mary's are to die for. We open with their pork jerky with a spicy sour dipping sauce. I had their Pad Thai and asked for a side of green curry to mix in the noodles myself. Ask them to add a fried egg on top which adds to the flavors. Love that they have a point system for spice 0 to 5 being the spiciest.

6cFASMWMqimb8vjqkvzJzg	4	2016-08-17 00:00:00	I've been here a couple of times and enjoyed this small cute half indoor half outdoor restaurant. In the summer months the indoor seats are really hard to get. If you sit outside, the roof is covered in a net that blocks out some of the heat. They also spray a cool water mist to cool you off that reminds me of being at an amusement park. \n\nThey have good lunch specials here. Not as good as chinatown but they knock off a dollar or two on the regular pricing that brings it to 10 bucks. I've tried the drunken noodles, curries, eggplant basil, pad Thai, and pad see ew. Everything is very flavorful ( although sometimes too salty). You can adjust the spice level. I always order everything in a mild or medium and did fine with the heat. The one dish that I don't like here is the pad Thai. That's supposed to be the staple dish in every restaurant but it's the one I like the least here. It's not like traditional pad Thai. The color is a little off and is definitely lacking in taste. The noodles were also super mushy and breaks into tiny pieces. \n\nI would definitely come back if I'm craving thai food in the downtown Fremont area.	2	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	CQZpblGIHeMlD7KqNP7J7Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

From that point on I knew every employee of this fine establishment would be my culinary spirit guide- leading me to rice noodle nirvana. \n\nDon't take a hot date here, because you'll eat so much you'll look pregnant leaving the restaurant.

Satay ok, kind of bland.  Wings good.  Hostess told us three times that next table ours then proceeded to seat others... More excuses, no table.  Gave up after two hours.

The restaurant left an excellent first impression. I enjoyed the general vibe and atmosphere and how nice the staff was. The pricing was reasonable, and I would definitely go back.\n\nYou go Le Thai, you go. \\m/	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	0uIGx_NZmzLVrToCD9bTjw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
6kdOihjMMLVYs5w699_DfQ	4	2014-04-22 00:00:00	This place is small and the wait time is horrendous \nI am writing this review as we wait for our food\nIt is now 9 53pm\nAfter waiting since 8 30 we still have not gotten one plate of food\n\n1. Ga pow- a good portion of meat and the texture of the pork was tender and not gritty. White rice compliments the dish perfectly, but on it's own can be a little too salty\n2. Pad Kee Mow- very flavorful dish with tender noodles and meat. My only complaint about this dish is that there wasn't enough noodles in proportion to the rest of the dish\n3. Short rib fried rice- so tasty but again a little on the salty side. But if you mix some white rice with it and add some thai chilies the dish is great.\n4. Pad Thai- it was a little too tangy and where were the peanuts? I love the peanuts normally on this dish. I felt a little sad that it wasn't what I expected\n5. Mango Sticky Rice-Delish!! The rice wasn't too sweet or too sticky but where's the mango?! Such a small portion of mango for $6.50....can't you charge $7 and give me more mango???\n\nWaiter Dino was very nice\nWhen he noticed we were waiting for a while he made sure to let us know \nThe girl in the front seemed snooty but after we talked her up a bit she was a tad more friendly...and by tad I mean I wasn't going to pull her hair from behind just to be like, who did that?! \n\nAnyways, this place was good\nCome when u aren't hungry\nBc by the time you get the food you will be starving \nGood tactic Le Thai...

6LA2tSDsJ3z1B19JYrovIA	4	2016-04-22 00:00:00	Le Thai is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas. \n\nFOOD: I haven't been disappointed yet. I like to start every trip with the Pork Jerky. It's pieces of pork are cooked till crispy on the outside and juicy in the middle. It's served with sticky rice and waterfall sauce, which is fabulous in it's own right. A vinager based sauce that will make your glands very very happy. You mix them all together and you have an appetizer that does not disappoint. \n\nI'm ashamed to admit that I've tried nearly every dish on the menu but I can't help but keep going back to the Pad See Ewe and the Pad Thai at a spice level 3. The soy sauce based sauce on the Pad See Ewe makes this dish rich and flavorful. If you're looking for something lighter, I would go with the Pad Thai, unlike most Pad Thais, this dish leans more towards the fresh and citrus side of things rather a red pepper / chili sauce. You won't have Pad Thai like this anywhere else, at least I haven't found it. \n\nOh, and who can be upset with a Thai Coffee? \n\nSERVICE: Service is the only reason Le Thai doesn't get a 5 star rating. It's very touch and go and times. There have been visits where the service is impeccable, they are friendly and attentive; other times not so much. It's a toss up, but the food always comes out delicious so I can handle a mediocre experience from time to time.  \n\n\nAMBIANCE: Le Thai isn't a large place but I've never felt crowded, I prefer outside seating. It's heated in the winter and cooled down in the summer so it's always comfortable. Being downtown has it's perks because there's often a wait to get seated, but it's a quick stroll to container park or Fremont Experience so there's plenty to do while you wait.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ZQJxsFQuyXF87b5rxEvpeg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It is very small---which is fine, but not when it is 100 degrees and get seated outside...not by choice.  The misters didn't seem to cool us at all and made for a very unpleasant experience.   The Pad Thai was okay, nothing superb and the egg roles were so greasy we could hardly eat them.  The service was good but the quality and price of the food was not impressive.  Maybe I will have to try again...I have heard nothing but great reviews from friends and would like to join on their bandwagon.

Finally the hostess said hello to us without a smile or personality what-so-ever and she sat us at a table. Then we waited... and waited... about another 10 minutes passed... No one ever came to our table. So we go up and left. On the way out the girl said "Oh you changed your mind?" Ummm ya... we did. FAIL. Oh and just an FYI - the menu is tiny!!!

I had Pad Thai with fried tofu, my wife had Shrimp with Red Curry. I asked for 4 out of 5 hotness and I got my wish. Noodles were incredibly spicy and flavorful. Curry was delicious. This us regrettably a small, crowded, noisy place, especially with thw continual take-out service. Also a little pricey, but I understand that. Service was not super, but good enough for my taste. Close to a five.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	vg5PsaVkpzjam-U7HENwuQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
6rCTo0APOsuvG9ulY-GyJQ	5	2016-09-04 00:00:00	This place never disappoints me. It is by far my favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas! My boyfriend and I came for dinner before a show so this time we ordered cocktails and the Thaijitos were outstanding.  We ordered the spring rolls for an appetizer and they were delicious they were nice and crispy and had good flavor. I had the 3 color curry with a spice level of 10 and boy did they  deliver.  Not sure if going  to 10 is new since in previous visits they told me they only went to 5. This was the first time I actually got a 10 that packed a punch. My mouth was warm and tingling and my nose was running it was perfect! !! My boyfriend had the Awesome noodles with tofu and was extremely tasty! I can not recommended this place enough and besides being delicious the prices are extremely reasonable.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	_hkoZJvCFllRApWIrJfK7w	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
6rf07ZWjJySwIcaG5LCwEQ	4	2013-01-26 00:00:00	I'm a big fan of the Downtown area, it's gelling into an authentic urban streetscape that makes me want to move to the area just so I can see it realtimes...albeit I like it more at night than in the daylight hours... (less visible decay)... don't hate me...\n\nI wanted to get more involved with Downtown, and when The Downtown Project presented a panel series of inspirational speakers, I decided it was time to climb out of my nested cocoon and head on down.  And to piggyback the event, I wanted to try Le Thai, a much raved Thai restaurant that recently opened on Freemont Street.\n\nAnd from the street, the place looks awesome; from the modernness of the corrugated steel facade juxtaposed with the the retro neon signage, it's managed to synthesize old and new Vegas without any gaudy Disney/stripper pole/bordello theme in which the Strip seems to steep itself until a bitter brew.  It's a breath of fresh air, frankly and with other venues like Commonwealth and Velveteen Rabbit bring life to an already transform Freemont Street, it'll making coming Downtown an enjoyable night out.\n\nWith the Maitre' D out front, it looked like the interior was super tiny and jam packed, but there's outdoor seating in back with heat lamps, which turned out to be a roomier sitting area.  This would be a great place to sit and drink in the coming months before the heat sets in, not quite sure how they would cool that space...   One wall is covered with a colorful mural, but otherwise, it stays true to an outdoor atmosphere with exposed wood beam frame, rope lights and garden furniture.\n\nSeeing one of my favorite appetizers on the menu, I was excited and anticipated a great evening: Pork Jerky + Sticky Rice + Waterfall Sauce. And when it arrived, it did not disappoint, juicy bits of succulent Pork accompanied with a most amazing Sauce bringing it to a higher level of flavor.  And with the Sticky Rice, its just such a comforting dish I feel like I'm at home...\n\nAnd as a measuring stick, I always judge a Thai restaurant by it's Pad See Ewe.  I ordered the spice level of two (normally zero) just to gage how Le Thai handles its hotness scale.\n\nWhen it came to the table, it arrived in a large heaping bowl, steaming, piping, right-out-of-the-wok furnace of noodles, where you know you're gonna sweat halfway through the meal. It's a love/hate relationship, appreciative and ~~~~at the same time..\n\nA spice level two at Le Thai was not quite as I expected; for it had an unsurmountable amount of spice, (as a Thai for 'not too spice' and they might as well pour gasoline down your throat and chuck a match) which would have been fine, but the dish lacked that Soy umami flavor in which Pad See Ewe comes in abundance, the flat broad noodles sucking in that sauce and trapping it it's chewy cells.  To top it off, by adding the searing heat of a thousand suns, it was hard to taste much of the dish. A shame, since I was very impressed with the quality and amount of Beef, as well the Chinese Broccoli- you can tell the ingredients were premium, just the balance was off.  As a test, I had the cold leftovers the next day, and it was the same, lotta heat, little Soy. Somewhat of a disappointment.\n\nHowever, since I only had two dishes with a fifty/fifty success rating, I vow to come again and order more and reach outside my comfort zone before the final strike of the gavel.  I loved the ambience and the service was impeccable.  \n\nRatings (Out Of Five Stars)\nFood:           4\nAmbience:   5\nService:        5	3	0	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	NVA5YEBmV_OdgCuI5RGp3A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
6TDjVTY78NmMudb41bJneQ	2	2015-06-09 00:00:00	Le Thai is a cute restaurant tucked into the craziest of Fremont St. It is extremely small, there is usually a wait, but they text you when your table is ready. I went in with really high expectations because the guy I was there with on a date said it was the best place in Vegas, but I wasn't that impressed. \n\nService - They sat us at a counter right next to the kitchen. Every time someone walked in or yelled at the chef, we were in the middle of it. It was a little annoying. The staff was friendly, but it was slow. \n\nFood - We ordered the Green Curry and the Pad Thai. The Green Curry was good, and the shrimp were succulent. The Pad Thai was not good. Pad Thai is my favorite Thai dish, but I did not like theirs. I would definitely not order it again.\n\nI would be willing to try this place again, but it may be awhile.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	GUx6CHEbdcNVVXDIDm5Bxw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It was fairly busy.\n\nI really like what they did with this space, though I must admit I don't remember what used to be here.  Lord knows I've stumbled by enough times on my way to/from the Cortez.\n\nOrdered the Three Color Curry (level 4) and a Singha.  The waitress used an Iphone to take my order, gotta love technology.  Some Aussie plopped down next to me, ordered Pad Thai from a different dude (w/o an Iphone), and wolfed down his Pad Thai before I even received my entree.  So much for technology.  To be fair, the Aussie consumed his Pad Thai in about 90 seconds.  I guess the Pad Thai must be good!\n\nThe Three Color Curry was very tasty, although I wish it would have had more kick.  Solid food and fair prices.  And they're open late, which is nice after a long night of gambling and drinking downtown.  \n\nRecommend.	0	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	SygwXJI8crPvG7owdPSeDA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We wanted to go to the Neon Museum but of course it was sold out for the day... Anyways the guy at the help desk recommended this Thai place for yummy food that wasn't a chain or on the strip.\n\nWe came in around 3pm and the place was full we sat outside with the water misters which helped a ton with the heat... for an hour I thought I was back in LA. \n\nStaff was super friendly and attentive and our food was delicious. I ordered the Ga Pow stir-fry level 3 spicy it was spicy so if your looking for something with a little kick for flavor get spicy level 1-2. \n\nIt's also really nice that they offer brown rice if you prefer it over white rice and with out a substitution fee\n \nPrice point is perfect not to expensive. They also have a happy hour 3-6 with a generous selection of beers and cocktails.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	TxPccHLH9uw97aq5l8u-Iw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Le Thai came up with solid reviews and Thai food was something that sounded perfect on a cooler Vegas day.  \n\nA short walk and we were there, and seated promptly in the small main dining room at a two top.  Based on a couple Yelper quick tips I decided on the Awesome Flat Noodles with pork accompanied by bean sprouts, onions, and green onion with a garlic strip fry sauce.  My Mom got a chicken soup (the non-coconut based one).  We both decided on medium heat after some help from our server.  Medium was the perfect level of spiciness for us, just enough to make your lips tingle with joy.  The Awesome Flat Noodle dish was just that, awesome.  Lots of pork and bean sprouts.  I ate the entire thing, a little embarrassed to say so.\n\nService was lack luster, nothing good, nothing bad, just basic if ask me but the food was the stand out.  Great Thai food found on Fremont street is a treat and we left happy with full bellies.	2	0	4	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	RRtMl0kS2ntfoxcQPJcmZA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I was able to try the beef panang which was creamy and rich curry served with a bed of fluffy white rice. \n\nThe Chicken Pad Thai was flavor packed, the beef salad was tasty as well but is not what I'm used to in California ours is spicy and citrus-y, and the beef is sliced much thinner which I like, but was still tasty just different.\n\n The papaya salad is served with a side of sticky rice in a neat little woven basket with a lid, but I didn't care for the flavor of the papaya salad, someone else might like it better, for me it was a little heavy with the fish sauce and not to the spice level I wanted which was a 3 Medium spice\n\nService was excellent and the food was served promptly.

7K4IlyX1-FcBf4LyHF16Qg	5	2012-05-18 00:00:00	In looking for restaurants with both high ratings and a close proximity to my downtown Las Vegas hotel, I found some reviews for Le Thai and decided to check it out. Damn glad I did too, because it was easily one of the best Thai food experiences I've had! With both vegan and meat lovers fare, this cute and highly energetic restaurant is a hipster bar (they had great music playing throughout my meal), an outdoor garden (the back patio was being used for a private event, but it's lovely and worth the trip to eat outside) and an excellent Asian restaurant all in one. I had the Chicken Larb and it not only tasty but generously portioned. The Thai iced tea was HUGE and they offered me a refill! THAT certainly doesn't happen at any of the Thai restaurants in Metro-Detroit. The local alternative newspaper was available so I sat at the bar - they have two, one specifically for drinks and the other which faces the kitchen - and looked for things to do downtown. Despite the reviews which say the service is just so-so, my servers were both incredible: friendly, funny, absolutely attentive and helpful with suggestions. An addition to the not-so-common atmosphere, the full bar has so many cocktail choices, you'll be hard-pressed to pick just one - it IS Vegas, after all. And any place with a "Ladyboy" cocktail is a keeper in my book!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	lZr8K_ClAnSCFWdOfXKZnw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

First off, Lotus of Siam is the best Thai food in Vegas but this place is definitely the 2nd best!\n\nI love the decor they have here, unfortunately, they have a lot of outdoor seating and if you know Vegas, it is freaking hot and you're eating spicy food! We came during a crowded time so we sat at the bar. We ordered a pad see ew and the short rib fried rice. We got spicy level of 7 on a scale of 10 and it was not spicy at all. I was expecting 7 to be like thai spicy where you feel like your face is going to melt off. It's all good though, just add extra peppers. :). The pad see ew was solid and the short rib fried rice was SO GOOD! It was exceptional and the flavors blend together so well. Prices are decent at $12 per dish. Also, next time I would love to try their alcoholic thai drinks like my dirty thai and a thaijito!\n\nOverall, great service and great food for a solid price!

The young people that work here are kind and attentive and very tattooed (I ain't hating).  It's a little cramped inside, but it was first Friday.\n\nSpring rolls- These are vegan and deep fried. Delicious and I'm not vegan. I highly recommend them.\n\nPad See Ew- I got a 2 out of 5 and it was spicy. If you are sensitive like me I would get a 0 because this heat was real! I didn't quite sweat through my hair (as I usually do), but I was embarrassed at how much I was going through in front of my company. I personally like my pad see ew to be savory over spicy. So I guess that means I can't hang. I also really like a lot of egg and I don't recall having much of that. \n\nThey have a beer selection you'd expect at a Thai restaurant. I had a tall Chang. They give you a small clear plastic cup to drink it out of. I wasn't crazy about that, but didn't care once I was sweating.\n\nParking: Located on Fremont near 6th. I personally prefer to park on Carson and walk over, but I wait until after 6 so I don't have to pay. Otherwise I park at the El Cortez and walk over (free). Take care of yourself walking over by not engaging the homeless as sometimes they are aggressive and occasionally physical. Any woman who has been downtown enough should not find this too daunting.	2	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	mxwMqra7TEZ6K4ML3DgPmA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

You can get the papaya salad sans spice and it's good all the same. It even comes with traditional sticky rice - dip it into the papaya salad sauce and it's MONEY. The chicken wings and pad Thai were bomb.com\n\nService: super friendly and chatty, the way I like it! \n\nAtmosphere: quaint and intimate but roomy enough. \n\nWe WILL be back here again soon!	0	0	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ihTu74HkXnKGuY5v_Z8b0g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

7ziGCL6FH8-JbsMswCbd_w	1	2014-02-06 00:00:00	I was referred to the restaurant by a friend and the food was very disappointing. The chicken in the 3 color curry was dry. The tofu in the mixed vegetables was deep friend and very dry as well. The short rib fried rice sig dish was presented like dog food in a bowl.  Plastic bowls and cheap plastic plates. I don't recommend this place for Thai food. The potatoes in the curry dish were hard and uncooked, they were not edible.  With a party of 9 and although the server was polite we were kicked out by a Manager suddenly because the table we were sitting at was promised to another large party which we were not previously informed of. We literally had food in our mouth when we were told we needed to leave. This employee was very rude and short and simply did not care.  Save your money and time and go elsewhere.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	cPPckSNe9nkGxvNdmNpNjg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I would also recommend vanguard very nice eclectic bar/lounge. Great experience at both establishments.	1	0	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	d6G0w_e3GaA90NSQeovShA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I'm glad I did.  It was phenomenal! \n\nLet's start with the service. I sat at the bar and a gentleman banned CJ helped me out. He was very helpful. \nHe suggested I try the waterfall beef with sticky rice and based on my fellow yelpers I tried the short rib fried rice. \n\nThe waterfall beef was great.

I can't say it was the same this time around.  The papaya salad was on the sweeter side and didn't taste like the Thai/laos style especially from the first time we had it here.  The pad sea ew with beef was terrible.  It was definitely not what we remember tasting last time.  The noodles tasted burnt and when I told the waitress she said it was normal and that the taste is more on the smoky side.  We have had their pad sea ew and many other pad sea ews and we have never had it taste smoky to where it tasted burnt.  It was very disappointing.  Service was also lackluster too.  Probably will not come here again.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	k0_iJys8a5Z_qCggcE8X7w	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We had to wait a little bit to get a seat but they'll take your phone number and call you if you want to wander around downtown while you wait.

7_jFAbS7SpzqpR3GZA23Pg	4	2012-01-31 00:00:00	Le Thai, I love you. I've had a meal in your restaurant every week since you opened and will continue to do so until I get completely burned out. Even though your pork pad prik, drunken noodles and pad thai are awesome, I feel the need to try every single dish on your menu. Today I went for the Thai style beef salad, which I very much enjoyed, especially since it is low cal and you only use oil to cook the beef (dressing primarily fish sauce I'm told). My problem is that most of your dishes are a good value, but this one was $8 and not very big. My advice to you is make it bigger or charge less. \n\nOne more bit of feedback - get some real iced tea. EVERY single time I'm there, I'm either with someone who wants iced tea or I hear someone try to order iced tea. All you offer is a sugary raspberry tea, which really isn't what you want to drink when you are eating spicy food. \n\nThanks for coming downtown. You've made lunchtime so much better.	2	2	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	kEH9rD6yJbGYcvp9_2RKrQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

You know- that one block or so on Freemont just east of the over-run Disney-fied downtown Freemont Experience section.\n\nI thought the lunch specials were decent, though maybe a bit pricey considering the portions (which weren't skimpy, but not quite large enough for the price paid).\n\nUnlike many Thai joints, this menu isn't extensive.  That's actually fine, as long as the food comes with tremendous value and is done perfectly.\n\nI liked what we ordered, and the balance between spice and flavors were good, but still feeling like what I ate could have come with a bit more to it, or at a lower price.\n\nExtra credit given for the late night hours.	2	2	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	15nD50SrNJN8E5DYDa0GWQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I love Thai food and of the many Thai resteraunts I have tried, this is one of the best.  I've tried several curries and items off the lunch specials and they have all been good.   Their spicy scale of stars tends to be on the spicier side, such as where I would normally order a 4 or 5, here I order a 3.  Come early for lunch or you'll have quite the wait as this place is not a secret and frequented by many local professionals.	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	2eg_9ShLmOl_O-d5-sRxnQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
88SlX8upAkNVVkatALXnnw	4	2014-04-02 00:00:00	As we walk in, my fiance exclaims "This place must be legit, they have katoys working here." \nAside from his comment, this place is legit in terms of food, but not legit for the wait time. So you can call in and put your name on the wait list and they call you or use the NoWait app. I was told and texted 15 min wait, but ended up waiting 30 minutes before I headed over to the restaurant to make sure we weren't being shafted.  Word of advice...we showed up and there were at least 4 open seats for a party of 2....big fail Le Thai.  The chick at the front needs to get on top of it when it comes to texting parties when tables open up. We probably didn't need to wait at all, but we trusted they were going to text us.  Okay, so lesson learned there.  \n\nOnto the food, this is what gives them the 4 stars.  We ordered:\n\n1. Pork jerky with sticky rice and waterfall sauce: Fried pork that is moist (not like jerky) that is sweet/salty with a citrus dipping (waterfall) sauce, I mean this is close to perfection.  I can probably eat this as a meal by itself!\n\n2. Thai wings with sriracha ranch: fish saucy in taste with a hint of sweetness, fried to a dark brown color...the flavor is so intense inside these wings and outside that it definitely does not need the sriracha ranch.  I ate the wings without the sauce and it was amazing, my favorite dish by far! I was upset my fiance didn't sacrifice and give me part of his share of wings.\n\n3. Short rib fried rice: this dish may have been over hyped by past reviews, while good, not amazing that I would pay $13 for fried rice again.  It was good fried rice, but maybe a little overly sweet because of the short rib pieces.  It didn't end up being spicy enough to balance out the flavor of the short rib.\n\nI will admit I was biased against this place, since I figured it was mediocre Thai food meant for tourists...but it was definitely comparable to the other Thai places in Vegas.  A little bit pricier but that comes with the territory.	3	2	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
89606xzI3ixm1pENh02TpQ	4	2016-03-04 00:00:00	I actually enjoyed this place more than I thought I would. I'm by no means a Thai connoisseur, but everything I tasted here passed muster and more. The service was attentive and friendly. The atmosphere was vibrant. Make sure you make a reservation if coming at peak times.\n\nOur group tried the Thai Wings (BOMB--don't even think about it, just get them), crab rangoon (your typical American Asian fare), Crispy Spring Rolls (nom nom) for apps. The Thai style wings are not too spicy for your non-spice loving friends, but still interesting enough for those who crave heat.\n\nEntrees--ones that stood out were the Short Rib Fried Rice (shockingly tender short rib melts in your mouth), Ga Pow (I can't even describe to you what makes this dish so good--I think the flavors just meld together in an awesome way.)\n\nThey brought out what I think was the Roti for my friend's birthday. It tasted a little too egg-y for my preference, but it was good.\n\nDefinitely coming back!	0	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ynK_4lHrkqdXSHdrtQdq6g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

She said there would be a 30-40 minute wait and we could relax at the tables outside. About 5 minutes later she told us a table was opening up and to follow her inside (yes!).\n\nI got the Tri-color curry and my girlfriend got the Awesome Noodles. I was expecting something like a bed of rice with three colors of curry on top: Red, Yellow, and Green. But it was more of a yellow curry with some red peppers and basil. Tasted great!

8d_UyUci-dCT2VKake1Vkw	4	2012-05-04 00:00:00	With one of the most concentrated bar areas in all of Vegas, it is important to have food. Not just any food, I am talking about good food. Luckily, Le Thai meets that requirement. The close proximity to Don't Tell Mama and Drink and Drag makes it that much better.\n\nThe first time I came here, I didn't even know they had a courtyard. This time, Katrina M. and I sat outside. We were not that hungry, but needed something to soak up the alcohol. The pork jerky was not bad. Served with a fragrantly spiced dipping sauce and sticky rice, it is a meal within itself. The massaman curry was what hooked me. The spicy, rich, complex flavors paired with brown rice hit the spot. Nothing goes better with alcohol than spicy food. I would suggest getting another meat other than beef, because it was tough. Otherwise, I was in love. \n\nThe staff was also very efficient. They worked as a team and it made everything a breeze. We ordered the app with one, three different people checked up on us, we ordered the entree with one of the three, and then the two order takers periodically dropped by.	4	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

8qHIoTdW7n4FapTXn8DpFw	1	2014-09-14 00:00:00	We just left this restaurant.  I can truthfully say the food was amazing. We had two servers who were fabulous. The manager however needs to reconsider her job choice. We made a reservation for a group of 15. We were hoping to go at 7 but they asked us to come at 6:30. Fine, we did.  When we for there they were not prepared for our group. We pulled the tables and chairs ourselves. Then after all 13 of us had ordered, the manager came over and said they only had 2 woks going in the kitchen and could we combine orders. We then took our order down to 10 orders. We of course ended up adding more dishes. The manager spent the rest of our stay glaring in our direction. Then the bill came...wow. They put extra food on our bill. When we told them about it, she was condescending and made it sound as if we were lying and then as if she would punish the kitchen for sending us food we didn't order or eat. We paid, making sure we counted out every cent of the money to her so there would be no confusion. We walked out of there and straight into a bar at the container park to wash the taste of this horrible customer service off our palates. Some of our party had been here before and spoke of how great it was...sadly none of us plan on returning.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Gh1ZiyCW7h2-e8FnSZCyHg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We walked in and were seated right away.....at the outside patio. Sure it was tolerable (barely) because of the misters but at least ASK if that's ok. The hostess doesn't seem very friendly but that may be because of the heat. \n\nOur waitress was friendly but initially forgot our water and later condiments.\n\nWe were brought a carafe of water and two little bitty glasses.....did I mention it was about 110 degrees out. But the Coke I ordered (because it was included in lunch special) was in a huge glass :/\n\nOn to the important stuff, the food!\n\nThai crispy wings-delicious! Flavor soaked into the meat. The sauce they serve with it is a mayo base, not that great so at least the wings were good. \n\nPanang curry with chicken-average, good but nothing special\n\nBeef and meatball noodle soup-average, good but needs some work.\n\nPad Thai-delicious! Pleasantly surprised :)\n\nWe ordered everything spicy number 4 out of 5 and they delivered what we expected. We love spicy food!!\n\nSo food is overall good, service average and atmosphere cramped inside and hot outside (during summer).\n\nProbably won't return unless we are in the area and craving Pad Thai.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	UbLZsES_aV_-z7mon6tNaw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The restaurant itself is fairly small, but they have a patio and bar area which both serve food.  The restaurant is clean and cozy with very friendly and attentive wait staff. \n\nThe food itself was very good and priced reasonably especially considering how expensive food on the strip is. I had the drunken noodles with tofu (and man do they give you a lot of tofu) which was spicy and delicious. Kendrick P had the awesome noodles which had more of a BBQ taste. Between the two the drunken noodles was the best, especially for all the vegetarians out there.\n\nThe only downside was the wait time. It took a hair longer than was expected to get our food after we ordered.

Entree shows up 3 minutes after soup to get cold while I ate soup. \n\nThe Tom yom was very good and served very hot, temperature wise. The pad key Mao was ordered #4 fire hot on spicy ness and was warned by waiter "that's fire" are you sure you want it that spicy. I guess I should have ordered the #5 Thai spicy because #4 was not all that hot for a chili head. Good flavor on both. I'd like to give the food a 4, service a 1 1/2 at best.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	N45HKMmOlCLAGKxlNaij2A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
98LR8sEh-aMwX50zRxZoEA	1	2012-08-19 00:00:00	I don't know what the rave is about this place.  First of all the service is less than acceptable and not enough help anyway.  The food is mediocre at best.  We ordered the Thai Beef and Meatball soup, well we tasted more spice than anything else and we had ordered mild because of the comments we read about the spice level of this place. Soup was a very spicy bland broth with no particular flavor other than hot.  The Pad Thai was a disappoint; we definitely had better elsewhere.\n\nAs far as atmosphere, would you believe they turned off the misters in the patio at the height of service Saturday night.  What were they thinking?!  It became miserably hot, especially since the humidity has been elevated the past few days.\n\nThis is not a place I would recommend.	3	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	xdMMcxTb6sH2juxe9K_Tog	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Even the sign is an eye catcher. \n\nOnce entering this place almost immediately we were seated and greeted. Loved how there was a check in for free thai tea (with a purchase of one of course), but still I love anything that could get me something free! The menu wasn't over beating, it was mostly short and concise. \n\nI got the beef pad seeu and the bf got the beef Penang. Food presentation was awesome, and the flavors were all there. Kind of on the pricey end for me l, since I'm used to paying only $8 at thai noodle house. But for a meal that's in this area, I would say this was not bad at all. \n\nSo, if you're ever in the area and have the cravings for some Thai food. I suggest trying this place out.	3	1	3	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	0guV-tXB82pi2stV7a5g5Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
9AP9WEmRk4KMgcDqkF2RZg	5	2015-06-12 00:00:00	I love this place. The food is amazing and the servers were super nice. After reading some of the past reviews, I am thinking they have a new hostess. I didn't ask her name but, she is a young African-American lady. She picked up my purse, which had slid down the back of my chair. Thanks again! I'll be back. \n\nHere's the things that I tired. \n* Coconut (veggie) soup\nThe best ever. Freshly cut veggies and lots of Basil. \n* Ginger fried rice\nI don't normally like fried rice but, this was great! They use fresh cut vegetables and spices. It's not just the usual frozen peas, corn and carrots. \n*Cucumber salad \nSliced and de-seeded with vinegar and crushed peanuts on top. Simple but, a great low-cal side.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	tKB9Y0sP4o-SOCnxA6WUEQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

9CvAFQnutILZuQ1uqYLylA	2	2015-01-17 00:00:00	Ok I'm giving Le Thai a 2 star mostly because of the food. I'm not saying it's not good it's just not that authentic. \n\nI've been here before in a small group and food was good just not true Thai it's too Americanized. It has all the parts just not the flavor. \n\nFor a hip, trendy hang and something super out of the box it hits it out of the park. The place is small and fills up quick being that it's quit a popular place but it is still comfy and it does it's job by transporting you straight to the market cafe/bars of Thailand. The drinks are all pretty creative and I like how everything on the menu does have a neat twist on traditional options.Warning do not go in groups of more then 10 people they have this weird rule where they force you to order family style and tack on $400 plus whatever you order. So weird and so confusing. I still don't know how they came up with that idea and how it auctual it works. \n\nOther then that this place is very cool and food is just right if you are not looking for real real Thai. Expect to wait a while, but once you are in you won't be disappointed because overall everything is good...oh and service was 5'S our waiters were the best and the lady did worked it out with our group and owner fixed everything at the end.	3	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	YLeDSZ1Nh1N0hNsSyQdE3A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I had the Tom yum Gai and Panang curry, the soup was perfect, not greasy and very flavorful. The Panang was delicious. But my favorite in the curries is the 3 curries \nWATCH OUT! This place can be very addictive. I'm used to spicy and had asked for a 5 thai spicy it's hot but edible. But it had a good zing for minutes... It's worth visiting. I'll be back for sure.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	YSI6ca4Wc50xfQz3pDgAZA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Le Thai is a gem located downtown on Fremont St. Although I am a bit of a Strip-snob, when venturing downtown, Le Thai is a solid choice for thai food.\n\nMost recently I enjoyed the Thai beef salad. Although the meat wasn't as thin and tender as what is found in the Thai beef salad at Pin Kaow, the flavors and textures were still delicious. I had a spice level 4 (scale 1-5) and it was a nice amount of heat.\n\nI didn't mind sitting outside, although it is still a bit chilly now. The space heaters they have strung on top of the patio provide ample warmth.\n\nService was friendly and quick. Will be back soon :)	5	1	3	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	haSh72Q0MsQZUpWPeVgp0Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

9HIP6vFxwqweXftoAUeyCw	2	2016-01-09 00:00:00	We had read a lot about LeThai and the experience here was bad, the food is passable and is not really what one would call Thai Food, no where close to it. We went there on a weekday evening and had a 60 minute wait, we came back in 60 minutes and were offered a table. The Service was prompt but the food a failure.\n\nWe ordered 1 x Spring Rolls [Egg Rolls], a Thai Red Curry Veggies (With Extra Vegetables), and a Thai Red Curry Pork [With Extra Vegetables]... The Spring Rolls came soaking in oil, as if they had been fried cold - they were not prepared fresh and seemed like they came out of a packet. The saving grace was the bottle of Sriracha that helped us over ride the taste of oil.\n\nThe Thai Curries were requested as Extra Spicy, but were no where close to what a Thai Curry is. The Base ingredients were not chosen properly, and it was missing both Lemon Grass as well as Kafir Lime leaves that are valuable ingredients to make a Thai Curry. It was also served with plain boiled rice, while there is always a suggestion of using a jasmine flower or a lemon when boiling rice to add fragrance to it.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend this place, well if you are in the mood for greasy food and you don't know what Thai Food is about - go ahead, but if you are serious about your food, take a cab and get to Thai Street Food Cafe, the total bill will still be less, including the Cab Fare and you would actually get better food.	2	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	dHTR27GGJ9MZS28zYQchbQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

9Q0EoQAPZm6R4NKGzlM0ww	4	2013-05-25 00:00:00	What a delightful and unexpected spot. I don't often get downtown. I need to, but like many locals, I stay on my side of town and hit up a few new places only on occasion. When it comes to Thai food, I stick with the places that know.  I have been disappointed too often in this town, and as a creature of habit, I like to know what I'm getting.  I found Le Thai on the Yelp site when I was looking for a place to meet a friend downtown.  And once again Yelp led me in the right direction. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Love the space. We first sat outside on an warmish March afternoon and were so impressed with how Le Thai made downtown Las Vegas feel like a hip SoCal location. The well designed outside area is small, but it feels miles away from the bustle of Fremont street. Since that first visit, my friend and I have been back a number of times, and have declared this our meet-up spot. The entire downtown scene has changed so much in the past few years that people who haven't trekked past the Fremont Street Experience are missing out on a number of creative and, more importantly, delicious spots downtown.  We keep saying that we will try a new place downtown business, but we continue to be drawn to Le Thai.\n\nPARKING: Please don't make the mistake I made on my first visit. Don't drive around looking for shelter in a casino's covered parking area. I had to hike to the restaurant from the Cortez's overflow parking. Instead, find the metered parking on 6th Street. It's pricey and your car will be exposed to the elements. But you will be a few steps from your car when you leave the restaurant.\n\nSERVICE: We have never had bad service at Le Thai. Never. The wait staff is warm and helpful. I love that they never rush us. We show up at odd times, so we are not in the middle of their dinner rush. I am sure yo are dealing with a less than enthusiastic crew at those times. But show up at 3:00 on a Wednesday afternoon and you will be treated with courtesy and kindness. I hate asking what I know are silly questions about the menu, but the servers are patient and informative.  Even when there has been a small mistake on an order or a drink has been forgotten, the response is always gracious and apologetic. \n\nFOOD: Delicious. I appreciate the simplicity most of all. I like a light touch to my dishes. All of my favorite foods are simply prepared and properly seasoned. Le Thai hits all the right notes.  The food is flavorful and comforting. \n\nVIBE: Easy SoCal Chic	2	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
9R4xn2Isl9H5nKQAFzXYSg	1	2013-04-06 00:00:00	Been here 3-4 times before and loved it.  Live in Las Vegas and this place is 20 minute drive from my house and probably 3-4 Thai places between.  With that said, I like to come here for special occasions because I liked the food and atmosphere so much.  After my last experience, it will be my last trip.  Ordered the chicken pad thai as spicy as I had the 3-4 times prior (Spicy level 3).  Food came and it felt like a level 10.  Told the waitress that this was a lot spicier than I've ever had and she said I should have asked her about the peppers.  She went on to explain that the peppers are new every two days and sometimes they can be extremely spicy and sometimes not.  Apparently I got a super spicy batch.  She did not offer to remake the food, discount the food etc, simply put the blame on me for not asking about the peppers.  Wasn't satisfied how we were treated so I asked a busser who was cleaning off our table if we could speak to a manager.  He went and got the manager and she was the one who was serving us!  Thought about emailing the general manager about our experience, but sharing our experience would be more helpful to other people considering this restaurant.	2	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	PVk2wJ33grzb_AhZ_hfETw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
9SKpZ6WtfGKMAnnKhQ0wqw	3	2016-05-15 00:00:00	The space is cozy and the ambiance is nice, but there were a couple of missteps during our experience here today that knocked my rating down to a 3. First of all, when we arrived around 5:30pm on a Saturday we were told it would be a 30 min wait for a party of 6, so we went to another store to buy something. 6 minutes later while we were in the middle of making a purchase, we get a text that our table is ready and had to hurry back. I don't mean to complain that a 30 min wait became a 6 min wait, but the time discrepancy seemed quite large at the time and threw off our plans. \n\nSecond of all, the timing of the service was a bit off. 5 entrees came out simultaneously, but our 6th friend had to wait an additional 10 minutes before his dish came out, leading to an awkward wait time for everyone at the table. \n\nThe food was quite good, although it didn't blow me away, especially since prices were on the expensive side (at least compared to Boston). My favorite dish was the beef pad see ew ($13), which has thick tender noodles covered with savory soy sauce and large slices of beef. I do wish that the pad see ew also included scrambled egg though, which would have made it more delicious. My partner got the chicken pad thai ($13), which we did not really enjoy. Instead of the peanut flavor we were expecting, the entire dish had a strong cilantro flavor that was almost overwhelming. \n\nRemember to check in on Yelp for a free 12oz Thai iced coffee with your meal! Our server was very nice and attentive, and honored the Yelp checkin for our entire table. He was even nice enough to give us the option between a Thai iced tea or iced coffee.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ZPN98PI53a9P7ZWM8V0qnw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I work at downtown area. \n\nSlow service and average food. \n\nWaiters are running all over the place but few things get done. We spent 40 min waiting for our food. The patio was cold, requested for the heater...got ignored....\n\nThe waiter came with his flaming Ipod to take the order, but no menus were offered....\n\nGot my beverage and no freaking straw was given. Tried to call the attention of the waitress but they kept running like idiots.\n\nFood finally arrived. Oh, wait no silver nor napkins were given to us....\n\nOrdered a Tom Kha not the whole menu. What took sooo long?? Whats the point of having an ipod??? \n\nTom Kha was actually very decent. Nothing mindblowing. There are SO MANY good thai restaurants in Vegas.... \n\nTime to pay. We got informed that no debit/credit card payment was available due to problems in the station. WTF?? Thank you for letting us know at the last moment.... \n\nWe requested to speak to the manager, she basically gave us the middle finger and told us to go to the ATM at El Cortez. Sure. Got charged $3 for withdrawal.... \n\n\nSecond time here. First time was disappointing. Now was ridiculous.\n\nHip-wannabe place with one of the WORST services ever received in a Vegas restaurant. \n\nScrew Le Thai.	5	5	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	2Qc7AAk2xQhxKrD7cJ3kxg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
9ViEwwz2qQwHZeavE9B-Cg	4	2012-08-21 00:00:00	I work downtown so I have had takeout from Le Thai multiple times since it opened.  I was impressed with the noodle selection - but actually have not had great experiences with the noodles in takeout form.  Once the drunken noodles were absolutely horrible - but that was my own ordering trouble as I ordered a 5 spice with ghost sauce when I really wanted a 3 spice.  The confusion stems from our other favorite Thai place downtown which is on a 1-10 scale.  Anyway, I digress.  \n\nRather than delivery, today I went in to Le Thai and my whole world changed.  It is so cute, great cantina feel up front and a patio in the back with fabulous ambiance.  Backyard chic between 2 brick walls in the middle of downtown.  It is fully private from passerby's (so no visitors begging for food or money) with a bamboo roof that lets just enough sun in and misters that are perfectly placed.  It was 100 degrees out today with raunchy humidity and I was totally comfortable.  We even stayed and chatted for a LONG time.  \n\nAnd lastly the food.  I think I actually enjoyed the food more going there.  I'd like to try the drunken &/or awesome noodles again while at Le Thai - I have convinced myself I will like them more.  Today I had Ginger fried rice with shrimp at a level 3 spice and it was very good.  Spice was just enough to make my mouth tingle but not quite "clear your sinus cavity" hot.  \n\nService was good and everyone was friendly.  So glad we went after the lunch rush because it was so great to sit and talk in this quaint place.   Oh and I went with a couple of very, very ANAL coworkers who both approved of the cleanliness of the kitchen.  I will definitely go back.  And after reading other posts I clearly need to try the waterfall . . . stay tuned . . . waterfall update to come!	2	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	stwmplf-HrcoPatLN7_jAA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

After having 2 babies and the only thing I craved was spicy as hell Thai and eating it for 18 months a few times a week...I would like to think I know good Thai.   Le Thai did not disappoint.  We had the Thai salad with shrimp, chicken wings, fried rice (although I can't remember which one), and the 3 spice curry. \n\nThe Thai salad was to die for...I've woken up numerous times in the middle of the night licking my lips craving it (nope I'm not even pregnant).   It was spiced with a sriracha dressing that made it spicy and oh so wonderful.  I know the rest of the food was equally as amazing, but the salad stood out the most.\n\nI LOVED the outdoor seating.

9zGoOfEGcGPYiHQ4Xn9spg	4	2012-01-30 00:00:00	Lotus of Siam gets a lot of attention for being rated the #1 Thai restaurant in the U.S. But every time I try to go there, there's either a line out the door, or it's closed -- as happened yesterday. I remembered hearing about Le Thai, so I went there as a Plan B. Now, it's my new Plan A!\n\nI'm not really a Thai food snob (I usually just order pad Thai)...and as anyone who's read my other reviews knows, I rate restaurants more based on their atmo than the food quality, anyway. You can get good food at the f*cking grocery store! If you're PAYING to eat out, you want a cool atmo, to make it worth your while. RIGHT?!\n\nLe Thai has a very cool atmo. It's cute and teeny-tiny -- so cute and teeny-tiny you almost expect it to start shooting ping pong balls out its....well, you know! About 1/2 is in the front room, and the other 2/3 is in this really cool sort of beer-garden-ish courtyard-type room. VERY cool!\n\nThe windows in the front room look out onto Fremont St. East, so depending on the time of day you can either watch winos and crackheads shuffling down the sidewalk, or drunk-ass college girls stumbling out of Insert Coins across the street. (I recommend the early show... the late show is old news. Although one of my fave things about this joint is that it's open til LATE -- midnight during the week, and 2am on weekends.)\n\nI went here for lunch, and had a bowl of tofu pad thai, a 4 on the spiciness scale of 1-5. It was GREAT! Pretty spicy, but tolerable, and I think it was around $8. Good deal!\n\nI am in the process of moving downtown...so I will most definitely be comign here again!	7	4	3	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The Waterfall beef was amazing and the chicken Pad See Yu (or however you spell it) was TO DIE FOR.  They have a great variety of Sake and the Coconut Nigori is my favorite.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	TkiJPESR2YSaVSlsIqtVuQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Thai was a really great choice when you are cold and it's dreary. My fiancé has never liked Thai food but dining here got him to change his mind. The fried rice was delightful as were the noodle dishes. It was interesting to have whiskey be a prominent focus in the bar drinks.

I came here since day one.\nI guess they forgot about the peeps that supported them since before they even had the sign outside the front door. Came for a table, not even greeted, didn't even say hello just "there's an hour wait." An hour? I get it but seriously? You can't even say hello, or screw you? Our group left, and all of us, which loved this place, will not be coming back. The people used to be humble and sweet now they think they're way too cool for school.	2	2	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Il2l0zODB-QDOynyDjor-A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
A7nCkBpzNYTaIouZHfoDkQ	1	2013-07-18 00:00:00	Just to be honest the one star is for service and first impressions.  Didn't even get a chance to eat here because of the terrible hostess!  Long story short, we walked up to this place, pretty much a hole in the wall, but because of yelp we decided to give it a try.  My group consisted of a 48 y/o (Me) a 40 something two obvious teenagers, a four year old, and lastly my 10 year old.  None of the kids can drink or gamble:)  It's about 107 in the shade, but hey we want the teenagers to try Thai food for the first time.  She looks at all of us and asks for our email and says 30 mins.  ok fine.  45 mins. later we get a text, cool!  Let's eat!  Get there, "Oh you can't go inside because of the kids".  WTF!!!!!!   You want me to eat hot spicy thai food with a four year old in the hot vegas sun!  What a nut cake!.   Needless to say we turned and walked away, never to return.  After reading a few more reviews I could see a bunch of bad service problems and a lot of so so food reviews.  I usually don't take the time to do this, but this was something else.  With all the great asian  food places in Vegas, I'm sure there are some great Thai places I can find.	2	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	G4x08yHTnXzUveDPZEHkxQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Aak4qb7NCDQO9BStqWANWA	3	2017-04-29 00:00:00	Honestly, I wanted to like this place. I saw it had rave reviews and it's in the midst of downtown, it should be great, right?? \n\nMy friend and I expected there to be a wait so we put our names on the waitlist through the Yelp app and waited 35-40mins. Showed up at the expected arrival time and was told I needed to check in with the host first before we would get seated. No worries, we did just that. And we waited about another 5 mins right by the host stand. The host calls me on my cell, I answer and go "ru calling me right now?"- as I'm making eye contact with her. And she is dumbfounded, stays on the phone and we stood there looking at each other like uhh...so anyway, we got sat at the counter tops in the back when there were plenty of tables open but, again. No big deal. What makes it a big deal is the fact that those tables were never sat the entire duration of our meal. \n\nSo enough about that. We've been seated LETS FEAST. We ordered the tom yum (with thick rice noodle for +$1) and chicken red curry. We were told the spiciness for both dishes out of 1-5 were both 1's. These meals had me in actual tears. Now, I confess I generally do not handle spiciness, well. But my friend I was with thought it was a bit much herself. What makes me most sad is that the flavor of the dishes were ON POINT. It was just entirely way too spicy for either of us to actually enjoy. We're used to Thai places accommodating everyone's palates- those who love to spice things up but those who enjoy things a bit milder, as well. \nWe ordered the mango sake and that was delicious. (Was close to $20/bottle, though) \n\nThis was just my personal experience. It is what it is. Take my review for face value! Try it for yourself, especially if you like thangs spiccyyy!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	DgrZfZXdzlwpL-9qmWyVMA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

As a nice coincidence, it was also happy hour and we took advantage of the wine discount and the chicken satay appetizer.\n\nWe also shared the 3 color chicken curry and the chicken pad Thai. We were very impressed with both and we have had both dishes many times elsewhere. Their pad Thai noodles were by far the best that we have ever tasted. \n\nService was great. Jordan was our server, and he was awesome, but we really liked how all the staff chip in and help each other.\n\nWe will be back soon, for sure!	0	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	syTxG8mBUsdhbAIFlvoW1g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
AB6fk9t46WrbAhopXyCGTA	2	2013-12-11 00:00:00	What the heezy happened in this joint? I walked into Le Thai pumped for Penang last night but I walked out of Le Thai-me Is Money shaking my head.\n\nAfter slinging back some cocktails at the Mob Bar with a few home fries, we trekked over to Le Thai for a pad thai party. We were sat right away on the covered patio outside, at which we proceeded to wait. And wait. And wait. What's a girl gotta do to get some agua around here when she's dehydrated from the drinking? Wait, I guess. Our server later came around to take drink orders, and while the same people who complained about the cold opted for ICED Thai tea, I asked for a glass of hot water. The teas came by, but lo and behold, no water - is this because we're having conservation issues? No matter - I waved down a busser who came by right away with the missing goods.\n\nOur roster consisted of Thai style wings, Thai beef noodle soup, Penang curry with brown rice, tom yum soup, and short rib fried rice. The food was actually really good, which was enhanced by the cold weather and my declining buzz. Plus, the soup was so perfect in the cold, until we realized that was it - we were sitting IN THE COLD, and only 1 of the 3 heat lamps were on. We asked a staff member if we could turn on the extra heat lamps, and we were shut down, being told that heat lamps actually weren't even really allowed, given the cover on the patio and all. As we watched the last of the heat lamps die out though, he refilled the lamp as if to do us a favor. \n\nThe curry came out with white rice which was frustrating if it hadn't been for another employee who pitched in yet again, but it wasn't anything compared to the irritation we harbored when we went to pay the check and were told they could only make four transactions total after we had calculated the payment for six people. One of us opted to pay with cash, and the change was rounded up because they did not carry change - I'm not sure if this was just the server, or the restaurant as a whole, but either way, it doesn't seem to make much business CENTS. \n\nI've never had much of an issue with the food here, but the service is just such a hit or miss ALL THE TIME, with it being more of a miss lately. I feel like I'm throwing the place under the bus, but I suppose this is the same disappointment my parents felt when I told them I wasn't going to be pre-med, and they've managed to move on.	4	6	5	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	v6oGFvXjuJ5DMT3pUqMXnw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

There's a service window street side. \n\nThey offer a lunch portion that comes with a soda just under $10.  \n\nThe yellow chicken curry was flavorful I enjoyed it. I did not enjoy the sticky rice as much as I would have liked to.  I've had better mango sticky rice elsewhere.

aFDGOK7zm0A3zyAmLybZkg	3	2013-10-18 00:00:00	Its solid Thai, solid. But three stars (really 2 and 1/2) because the last two times the waterfall beef tastes boiled and had that iron-y taste that bad meat cuts have and the sauce seems different. Sorry guys. It has become tough for business lunch because so many other professionals there. The curries and the panang are great. Atmosphere is more of a non-professional vibe to be more comfortable. \nI go to a lot of business lunches there, but frankly, the close quarters make me always feel like our conversation is being listened to. So social lunches good- business lunches not so much.\nI met the owner once at the bar with my wife late nite and had a great experience, really good times, but need to up the execution.sorry, this has been one of my stalwarts and needs a bit of a re-dedication, to me at least.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	MLGxKonhvb2rwDWbrYvnNg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
AfzLcC-T0XfermmMFUi7eg	3	2012-02-16 00:00:00	I've got Le Thai at a 3.5 out of 5 Stars.  Pretty good with some flaws.\n\n  Le Thai is a strange one to me, I can't exactly put my finger on it, but I don't mind eating there often (mostly because I live across the street), its better than most all restaurants around it, and its a pleasant dining esperience overall - it just doesn't get me that excited.\n\n  I've been here a few times and I've had the Pad Kee Mow, the Pad Thai, and the Awesome Noodles dishes.  The meat choices are beef, pork, chicken, or tofu.  I wasn't crazy about the Awesome Noodles, a bit too bland for me.  The Pad Kee Mow might be my fav of the three, but the Pad Thai is also good.  I think the noodles are a tad over-cooked and the meat is typically a bit too dry.  Not enough to make me dislike the meal, but still noticeable detractors.  There is also a pork jerkey on a stick type appetizer that i wasn't crazy about, too fatty/rubbery for my taste.\n\n  The meal selections are tiny, which isn't the end of the world, but there could be a bit more.  They use the same noodles for each dish and although different flavors, each dish seems omewhat similar for that reason.\n\n  I like the selection of beer and saki, especially the saki.\n\n  The atmosphere is kinda cool, with trendy inside and outside seating, but the inside area is really cramped with tables squeezed next to each other.\n\n  The service I've had has been hit and miss.  At times its been very good, and other times I'be been left alone for too long without refills or check ups.  I wouldn't go as far as to say that the service is poor, they are friendly enough, it's just inconsistant.\n\n  Pricing is very reasonable.\n\n  Location is good because Fremont has really been missing decent quality restaurants\n\n  In the end i would never steer someone away from dining at Le Thai, it's just that i wouldn't rave about it either.	3	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	n-U4c31vGjJ4SE91Qa93Vw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
aG9RXT2Ax9roVERj3Oqrlg	3	2012-12-19 00:00:00	Okay, this spice levels thing is really annoying me. If I order a level 3 because the server insists the chilis are hot right now and I get something  more bland than pepper, then I'm not going to enjoy my meal. I imagine those who are more sensitive to spicy food would be inconvenienced by this as well. Le Thai really needs to work on their consistency, or maybe teach their servers to not just smile and nod when someone asks a question. Also, their Tom Yum soup is so sour you can't taste anything else. I've fallen out of love with this place.	1	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	6ZUqLWRcu1ZuhUyZK1REgA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Aifp-E94IgejbPwsU6sBYg	4	2014-06-19 00:00:00	This place is a must go! Make a reservation ahead of time because the wait is about 1-2hours. I went on a Wednesday night and it was still that insane of a wait but worth it. \n\nThere is a little waiting area outside with a window so you can order drinks. So feel free to come on cool day or a nice evening just to hang out before your meal. You must have the majority of your party there ON TIME or they will give away your table and you will have to start all over again. Annoying but they have have such a high volume, they have to.\n\nThe place is very clean which I liked. They have a small inside area with a little bar. Very intimate area. Then they have a patio outback with a beautiful art piece painted on the wall. The bathrooms are located outside. I was shocked on how clean they are even for being outside. \n\nService: fantastic. We order a bottle which came in a ice bucket. We also had water which we went through extremely fast each time but never worries since they were so quick to refill them. \n\nFood: I was not a fan of the crab rangoons. I've had better at other restaurants. But the spring rolls are delicious. I know they have vegan ones too if you ask. This place is vegan to carnivore friendly. Spice level run from 1-5. I love spicy so I order a 4 for the tofu eggplant stir fry. Some thought it was a little too spicy. Just perfect amount of spicy and sweet for me. My sister order a chick pad thai. She loved it. You can pretty much order a few things and share them all. Most likely you will have leftovers too. The price matches the quality.\n\nOverall, this place a must try for DT. This is one of my favorite food spots when I come down here.	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	KvDSDDkC7ahEbSh1ZC_HoA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
AJ1CGuyGs5SF58N-kk-jNg	2	2015-12-03 00:00:00	Let me get something out of the way first, so it doesn't cloud my judgement while I write the rest of this review: if you think tracked lighting is an appropriate choice you are wrong. There is never, EVER, a proper time to use tracked lighting. Tracked lighting is the worst possible answer to literally every question in the universe, EXCEPT the question of which lighting solution is the worst possible lighting solution in the universe. I spent my entire meal trying to position my head in a way that would shade my eyes just enough to have a conversation with my wife. Tracked lighting, I hate you.\n\nNow that I have that out of the way, know that it doesn't affect my rating at all. That's just helpful feedback for perhaps the business owner to take to heart.\n\nThe short rib fried rice was awesome. That's what my wife ordered. I would have ordered two more of those for myself to go if I was going to give up on life and my wardrobe. Seriously, it was very, very good. \n\nUnfortunately, it isn't enough. I had to send my first entrée back, and its replacement, while better, was still not good. Our appetizers were also very short on flavor. The two entrées I had were both curry dishes, the second was chicken panang which is one of my Thai food favorites. The entrée it replaced was quite flavorless, and the chicken was undercooked. The panang itself had an excellent sauce, but the chicken was also undercooked and poorly seasoned. The sauce on its own is not enough to make that dish.\n\nThe appetizer we got was also a chicken dish. It had the same problem: slightly undercooked chicken making it tough and with a slight aftertaste, very under-seasoned leaving it without much flavor of its own.\n\nThe common thread here seems to be that nobody in this place knows how to properly cook and season chicken. As I said, the short rib fried rice was delicious.\n\nMy last problem is that, when asked how spicy from 1 to 5, I said "10. Make it spicy. I want to sweat as soon as I take my first bite." I got a dish that I wouldn't have considered to be "spicy" at all. On a 1-5 scale it would be a 0, an opt-out, a substitution of no spicy at all.\n\nThis is all so unfortunate, because I've heard a lot of good things about this place. It may have been an off night or a new cook. The service was very good but the seating wasn't great (tracked lighting!) and every time the door opened my wife was blasted with very very cold air. I will give this place a second try but not until it warms up outside and I can sit in the outdoor portion of the restaurant.	1	2	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
aj9i9uwogWxt4FlyxM8A8Q	2	2012-11-10 00:00:00	We tried Le Thai after reading many good reviews here. Unfortunately nothing lived up to our expectations. \nWe went early eve and were the only table in the indoor dining area and there were a couple people in the patio and a few people at the bar. We liked the interior, reminded us of L.A. Seemed like the kind of place locals would stop in after work\nOrdered spring rolls, Waterfall beef with sticky rice, Tom Yum shrimp soup, Awesome noodles with shrimp and Ginger fried rice with pork. I like very spicy hot food but my partner doesn't at all so ordered 2 of 5 on their spice level, playing it safe. \nSpring rolls were nondescript. \nWaterfall beef was tasty but no heat at all. Even my partner thought It had no heat.  Also, was poorly cut if you're only given a fork to eat with. If the intent was to eat it with the sticky rice, enveloped as you would a naam tok, they missed the mark with the way the rice was served, in a little  narrow tall basket. Way too awkward. Also the sticky rice was over cooked.  \nTom Yum soup was perhaps the worst I've had. very bland broth with over cooked shrimp, white button mushrooms and diced tomatoes. The tomatoes overpowered the soup and the mushrooms were, bland, just plain wrong.\nAwesome noodles were bland, void of any heat, a poor dish. \nGinger fried rice was also bland and no heat, another poor dish\n\nService was also below average. First table wobbled a lot. No wedges and folded napkins didn't cut it. no problem. moved to adjacent table. problem solved.  \nWe received paper napkins rolled around a fork. Food arrived w/o any serving spoons or utensils. Getting the waiters attention was harder than should have been. \nwe left a lot of food on the table. We were offered to go containers but I didn't want any reminders of that meal. \n\nLe Thai strikes me as a very VERY americanized thai restaurant. Even if the food we had was prepared with a much higher heat rating, I doubt it would have been good. The mediocrity of the food was not a matter of heat, it was just poor cooking.	6	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	uc5SI7_91nonDnujTB7tug	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I asked the security guard what it could be & he pointed in Le Thai's direction, right next door. \n\nWe ordered the Thai style wings with sriracha sauce, & pork Pad See Ew. I've had Pad See Ew all over town, & hands down...Le Thai has the best! The noodles had a sweetness to it & they even serve it with a fried egg on top. Something we haven't has anywhere else. The wings were fried perfectly & the sriracha sauce was delicious. \n\nCan't wait to go back! Yum!	0	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	tnI3KjWnykUgoTDE4jD0QQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The restaurant is located in downtown LV, but is about a block or two off the actual downtown strip. I like that it's tucked away from all of the lights and craziness. Once we were seated inside, we quickly ordered: phad thai, thai teas, coconut soup and an eggplant shrimp. My absolute favorites were the phad thai and soup-- absolutely delicious! I think the secret to their Phad Thai is the fact that they actually stir fry all the ingredients together and give it a nice char-- vs. the traditional method of cooking the noodles and then putting the cabbage and carrots on top. Whatever they do, it's magic!!	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	usxEZimtFq_HxbjpohB54g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

AWiMSnaP0NN3_4q15D3cmA	3	2012-03-16 00:00:00	Le Thai arrives in downtown Vegas with good thai food and a lot of spice, but they forgot to add customer service.\n\nDrop Le Thai in Las Vegas Koreatown and it would be a decent 3 star thai place.  It'd be good, but not award winning.  But in the culinary wasteland of downtown Vegas, Le Thai stands out as one of the best restaurant options.  Problem is, the customer service goes in manic waves between friendly and passive-aggressively rude.\n\nFirst, the food.  I've eaten most of the menu and there are some real winning dishes.  The tri-color curry is solid.  Combining red, green, and yellow curry in coconut milk is surprisingly tasty.  If curry isn't your bag, go for the "awesome noodles," which are . . . well, f**kin' awesome.  The sweet and spicy flavor is rich and blends perfectly with the noodles and the load of vegetables that come in the dish.  The cooks do a great job with cooking the meat in the dishes -- it will be tender and well-seasoned.  \n\nThis place is serious about its spice, by the way.  A 3 out of 5 will have your nose running and you'll be asking for more rice to cool down your tongue.\n\nThe pad thai is just decent.  I've heard some folks rave about it, but I wasn't blown away.  I'd come back and order it when I'm in the mood for pad thai and stuck downtown, but it's far from impressive.  The beef and meatball soup is similarly mediocre.  It tastes like a bland pho. \n\nAs for the problem with customer service: go there during a slow period of the day/night and you'll probably have a good experience.  But when the place gets busy, the staff can't handle it.  On at least 2 occasions, I've come in when the tables are full and the staff was busy.  The first time it was this busy, one staff member told me to stand by the bar and put an order in so my meal would be ready earlier.  Another came over to the bar and rudely told us that we were in her way, could not order in advance, and that we would need to wait outside.  Another time, the staff handled a busy day by ignoring us for very long periods of time.\n\nBottom line: some of the best food in downtown, but the staff can be downright rude \n[3.5 stars for the food minus 1 star for poor customer service]	8	1	3	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
AWWZPc7jj3c_gCfSGhLoxA	4	2012-01-11 00:00:00	I was quite impressed with Le Thai!  A few coworkers and I ate "family style" there today so we could give the place the "Thai test".  I can safely say that this place was a hit.  The atmosphere, especially outside, is really cool.  It's casual yet sheltering from down town Vegas.  There were heat lamps this afternoon since it was a little chilly which made the comfort level quite nice. To top that off, the service was excellent.  Food came right away to our table, and the waitresses made sure we were happy from start to end.\n\nFirst off was the Tom Kha Khi (chicken).  I ordered some lime juice on the side, as i usually do for this dish.  The soup was quite delicious, perfectly sour with my addition of lime juice.  Very nice coconut broth, lemongrass, generously sized and plentiful mushrooms, and a few chunks of chicken filled our bowls.  The mixture of herbs was masterfully prepared I thought, but there really wasn't enough chicken.\n\nNext up was the garlic fried rice with beef.  This was perfectly prepared, and again the herb flavors where just amazing.  The beef was flavorful and not at all chewy.  There wasn't too much grease, but there was tons of flavor!  Just how I like my fried rice.\n\nWe also tried the Awesome Noodles.  They are indeed awesome.  There is a similar dish served at Thai Style Noodle House, and Le Thai does a better job.  Light smokey flavors balance the lightly sweet sauce.  This dish is kind of a cross between Pad Thai and Pad See Ew.  Very nice, I would order again!\n\nLast up is the infamous Three Colored Curry.  I have to say that this was much better than the version we had at Mixed Zone.  It was light, but flavorful enough on my brown rice.  I would love to try a more "powerful" version of this curry.  \n\nFor dessert, we tried the Roti with Nutella.  This was definitely the most unique version of a Roti dessert that I have had.  There was fried egg in it, along with yummy Nutella, and topped with powdered sugar.  Very rich, very different.  It reminded me of French Toast with chocolate.  \n\nI am giving Le Thai a 4.5, rounded up to a 5.  While this place doesn't trump my two or three favorite Thai restaurants in Vegas, it is definitely up there.  The food is slightly Americanized, but my only real beef is the spiciness of the food.  This is definitely American spice levels, not Thai levels.  Of course that is nothing a little chili powder can't solve.	12	1	6	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

As a long-time local, this side of Fremont Street used to be the place to avoid like the plague, but now it's the hot spot of trendy restaurants and youthful vibe. Le Thai always delivers. Food is awesome. Anything with Curry is a good bet. The Short Rib Fried Rice is out of this world - what do they put in there that makes you not want to stop eating?

When we came here for lunch the receptionist table was outside but she was not at her station. So we proceeded to go in only to be yelled back outside. Not a big deal. My 60+ mother asked if ok to use the bathroom because we had every intention to eat there. After that, my father asked how long was the wait. They told us but it was too long because we were very hungry (late afternoon 2ish). So my dad says no thanks. At which point they go in and try to evict my mother out of the bathroom because customers only. Wtf?! We were totally going to eat there but wait was too long. Let the senior citizen use the bathroom anyway. Not impressed.	0	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	n2R5GZOIYKiBN0AvK06QEg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

B3isfbDG0Q0YhO1yyGJqXQ	1	2017-02-05 00:00:00	This place came highly recommended by friends as some of the best Thai food ever. Needless to say I was sorely disappointed.  The food itself was on part with other places, but not outstanding. The reason for the low rating is simple - the entire customer service experience was terrible. \nWe started with the hostess who was preoccupied with her phone and barely acknowledged that there were customers waiting to be seated. Once we did get the attention of iPhone girl, we were told there were no tables but we could place a to go order and sit on the empty patio. We ordered one entree, a soft drink and a cocktail.  The cocktail was ok, but the bartender messed up the soft drink. Ok, it happens. \nWe waited the stated 20 minutes for our food. Nothing. Waited a little longer but I saw orders waiting in the window. I assumed those were phone orders waiting for pickup. I inquired about our food and got the dish that had been in the window for at least 20 minutes.\nSo, yeah, I won't be heading there anytime soon. No recommendation to anyone else.	3	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	yBhn2_G4zf_9Y9YdzEmN1A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

b4gsrpTanyXgdFgce39_tg	4	2015-01-16 00:00:00	This is the second time I have dined at Le Thai, and both times have been great. A hidden gem of a restaurant, this place is cozy, unique and conveniently located if you are visiting the downtown area.\n\nDespite having a small menu selection, especially when compared to other Thai restaurants in town, everything I have tried is extremely fresh and tasty. Without further ado, let's review my visit\n\nService: The seating was prompt and the staff was upbeat and helpful. We were seated promptly and servers checked in with us often to make sure our meal was perfect.\n\nFood: Probably as authentic as it gets for Thai food in Las Vegas. Here are the menu items I would recommend:\n\n* Spring rolls: Golden, crunchy and tasty, these rolls are fried to perfection. Along with their sweet and sour sauce, these rolls make for a perfect start to your meal.\n\n* Waterfall beef: Delicate and tender, this beef appetizer is enough to be an entree. Mixed with a ginger-based sauce and accompanied by waterfall dip sauce (tangy/citrus and salsa like) and sticky rice, this dish will have you coming back! Full transparency... this dish was a bit on the salty side, so keep that in mind when ordering it.\n\n* Pad Thai: Amazingly fresh and packed with flavor, this Pad Thai has been the best I've had in town.\n\n* Panang Curry: Probably the reason I gave them 4 stars. I like to eat spicy food, but ALL of their curries are too spicy for me to finish. I was a bit disappointed because the taste of the dish was heavenly, but apparently there is no way for them make it less spicy than a level 4.\n\nEnjoy!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I asked the server for mild spice, number  one, and held up one finger.\n\nThe soup was so incredibly  spiced that I kept tearing & gagging.  Finally, I just stopped eating.\n\nThe smiling server came by & asked how the soup tasted.  I told him that it was over spiced .  He replied, " We'll, it is hot to begin with, and then when you order  level three, that's what you get."\n\nI just paid my bill & left.  Yes, I left a tip.\n\nWill I go back?  Yep.  Probably tomorrow!  It's a nice place.  \n\nNext time I will write my order & hand it to the server.	1	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	lZ6LSpqSBbOuWKqxvRq3mg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

B6zPDRhHMJrPSmdjsblvLw	2	2012-12-03 00:00:00	So there is a big buzz going around about the food at Le Thai and how great it is and after reading they were just put on the list of 50 best restaraunts by Eater Vegas I thought I would try it myself. So on Friday night I ventured downtown and entered Le Thai. Now for me I was going honestly just to find out if all the buzz was right and in order to compare one Thai place to another there is only one dish that stands out and that is  the pad thai noddle dish. First I was escorted in and sat down on there patio against the wall. This seating shouldn't even exist in my opinion but I understand that you work with what you have available. My server was very pleasant and busy and wasted no time in bringing over there "menu" (an incredibly dirty table tent looking thing). I knew what I wanted so I ordered the pad thai noodle dish at a level 4 and a bottle of sake. This is where things get interesting.. Not even 1 minute later the server brings out my bowl of pad thai and hands it over to me. The dish looked like it had been in a blender with everything kind of just thrown together. It was room temp with absolutely no level 4 spice to it. Now since I have been working in the food service industry all my life I came to the conclusion that they must have a giant pot in the back of pad thai noodles and whenever one is ordered you are basically getting a scoop hence the dish looking like "family meal" rather then a cooked-to-order dish worth the $11.50 they are charging. If you are in the mood for some amazing Thai food then I would recommended Archie's Thai restaraunts. It's cheaper and the quality of food is ten times better! Now I know that the buzz is more about supporting downtown business rather than food and the same can be said about the 50 top restaraunts list by Eater Vegas.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	CSM6tQ26wAbDRq9FAgAlHw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
B9sNXrXlzNoEfGYTbv7_6A	3	2015-12-11 00:00:00	I passed by this place the last time I was in Vegas so when I was up near Fremont Street, I decided to come here for dinner. It's not a very big place so there is usually a wait especially when it is cold out but we managed to get seated without much of a wait.\n\nWe ended up getting the crab rangoon for an appetizer and I had the larb salad for dinner. I rangoon was good... I am not sure that there was any crab in it but it was good. The larb salad was fine... the chicken was good but I think the waitress scared us off the spiciness a bit so I went lower than usual. It was definitely American and not Thai spiciness. \n\nI think this is a decent option but it's not the best Thai I've ever had. With so many great options around Vegas, I don't know if I'll get back to this one again.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	v-HcprOKPC1_F5_15t4JDw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The chicken wasn't too dry, the shrimp wasn't half cooked, and the noodles weren't too mushy. Definitely worth the 40 minute wait. I also got the Roti, since I'd never heard of it. So delicious!

BjqDjqgmT8IAa1JOkuNTdQ	4	2013-05-09 00:00:00	When I lived in Vegas this part of downtown was just starting to get redeveloped.  Since I left in 2011, I haven't seen the progress.  So, on a recent trip, I decided to check it out for myself to see what was going on.  I told The Better Half to save her appetite so we could sample some food in the area.  After walking around a bit, we decided to check out this joint.  We ordered:\n\nPad Thai Tofu, $13\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?select=2MDRNsUbJhq1-6P5SzQS6w#2MDRNsUbJhq1-6P5SzQS6w\n\nPad See Ew, $13\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?select=jwQ2r-YOmMef6Mn9yISnkQ#jwQ2r-YOmMef6Mn9yISnkQ\n\nThe food came out shortly after we ordered it and we dug into our dishes.  They were very good!  I had the Pad Thai and it had the right combination of sweet and spicy flavors...and they cooked the Tofu just how I ordered it, a little crispy.  Believe it or not, many Thai restaurants can't get that right.  The Better Half enjoyed her Pad See Ew.\n\nOur server and the hostess who sat us were very friendly and offered warm smiles despite being very busy with many demanding customers.\n\nThe only small complaints I have is that the seating in the front room is kind of tight.  We could easily hear the conversations of the tables next to us and the elbow room was less than ideal.  I felt like we had to whisper so that they couldn't hear our conversation.  Also, parking is a bit of a challenge.  You'll have to park at a nearby parking garage or casino and walk here....which isn't too much of a problem if this area is your destination for the evening.\n\nOverall, great restaurant.  Glad to see them busy and they appear to be thriving. \n\nReturn Factor - 92%	7	0	7	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

bJxxVOYS9Bq9BqKkdvGWmg	5	2012-01-16 00:00:00	Again, Le Thai did not disappoint me. This will be my second 5 Star review of this establishment which has now become a favorite of mine in the Downtown area and I adore downtown. \n\nI love the atmosphere here and I certainly enjoy sitting at the bar to drink and dine. I ended up here with a friend after happy hour at Vanguard. I told her about the wonderful Lady Boy cocktail and that she had to try it. We ended up both having two while we dined! It is just an amazingly good drink.\n\nThis go round I had the Pad Thai at a spicy level of 3. It was a generous portion served in a lovely clean, white bowl. Of course, I gobbled it down quickly, although slowing towards the end because my mouth was afire! But seriously, it was good pad thai. I have come to a conclusion that they do not snub spiciness here. If you are a spicy fan than you gotta eat here.	2	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

If you call in, the food is usually ready within 20 minutes.\n\nI would highly recommend the short rib fried rice paired with the tri-colored curry.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	8D-RcIdSYNXoeYArudrXsg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
bKvy9M8QTcSkVWIiYujExg	4	2016-12-17 00:00:00	Le Thai is great place to grab some food, but it's popularity has come at a price. The food to me hasn't changed, I've been here more than a few time between two years.\n\nI've had the curry and it's good, I've had the short-rib rice and it's better than good, I've had the ga pow with chicken at a 3 and it's delicious. Now I can eat it at a 4 or 5, but it's not about the spice. Get the ga pow at a 3 trust me, if you like hot food get it at a 4, but the 5 takes away from the taste.\n\nDon't get mad at a place, which is tiny and popular, if they can't get you in right away. Also I love yelp, but I feel sometimes reviewers give a very narrow view of an experience which they've had once or twice. Which I loved for the raw content, but sometimes it's bias and that's unfortunate.\n\nThis isn't the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas, but in downtown it's damn close. Give it a shot and I bet you won't be disappointed.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	XoKJgmuHPMwd_C4x7cUqWg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I would like my mouth to taste like that all the time.  The Three Color Curry is amazing as well as the Waterfall Chicken. The staff is friendly and the atmosphere is cozy.

Tastes were to me, just average. \n\nThe Thai iced tea isn't overly sweet. Good and cold. \n\nThe fried bananas are good. It's wrapped in a spring roll type wrapper, fried, has banana syrup drizzled on top and dusted with powdered sugar. The banana is mushy, but a good mushy. \n\nI'd try this place again if I'm in the mood for Thai while in Vegas.	0	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	JNTHN9MKeTnEp2xcpLr-7g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

BrbGvApbkhmLcPNGxVTFmQ	3	2014-06-23 00:00:00	I walked in on a Thursday afternoon around 3 pm.  There was no line and was quickly seated. The waitress was kind and helpful in describing the house specialties.  I was excited to eat here after getting a couple recommendations and seeing the good reviews.\n\nAmbiance: I loved the interior and decor.  It's not tacky American Asian restaurant. It has a nice authentic vibe to it.  It's also well-located in the middle of downtown, half a block from the Fremont Street Experience.  Perfect if you don't want to drive and you're staying downtown.\n\nI ordered the Awesome Noodles with spicy level 3.  They were good, but not amazing. The spice level was perfect.  If you like the upper level of Medium, then 3 is the way to go.  However, the food was not worth $14! That's pretty expensive for downtown Las Vegas (it's not the Strip, remember).  For that price level, you can expect knock-your-socks-off great Thai in San Francisco, DC, or NYC.  \n\nI ordered a Thai iced tea as well, which was fine.  All in all, my tab came to $22.  That's insane for one entree and one non-alcoholic drink at 3 pm on a Thursday.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	rKc1ktoAfzlbIM8VeWoJCA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

BtXrEvZZVrKbBlPYzlxpKg	2	2013-04-18 00:00:00	Some disclosure is warranted here: I have very little experience with Thai food and when I have dined at Thai restaurants in the past I always got the same thing, chicken with yellow curry and rice.\n\nDay one I had pad see ew with chicken at 3 out of 5 spiciness.  Holy smokes was it pretty tasty but it did smack me in the mouth a bit with the spiciness given my lack of experience with this type of food.  Day two I had the pad kee mao with chicken.  This time I backed the spiciness back down to 2 out of 5 and that was more to my liking.\n\nThis place is pretty deceiving when you look in.  Over half of the restaurant is outside with a makeshift bamboo roof covering you.  Service is OK, yes just OK on both visits from 2 different waiters.  Kind of slow, kind of boring personality-wise.  Good thing the food almost makes up for it, almost.	0	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	UQB87Neb-M6xbxT6hi9rcw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

BWp5gB3xSyWGmrNx7jz45w	4	2013-10-22 00:00:00	4.5 Stars\n\nMy buddy had been raving about this place non-stop while we were in DTLV, he was getting me all excited too so I knew I was going here before we left no matter what it took!\n\nWe ended up going on Saturday night at 8pm with a big group, we did have a reservation. We got there a big early and we got some cocktails, which we were planning on doing anyhow. I ended up getting a "Ladyboy" which was pretty funny name for a drink at a thai place. It was good and interesting, kind of like a Thai mule style drink. \n\nSo we had to wait a long time to get seated, to order, to get the food, to get the check etc etc. And that's why this place isn't getting 5 Stars because the food is ridiculously good! And I'm giving them 4.5 because it's pretty obvious it's a small place that just can't handle huge parties. \n\nWe ordered some appetizers, the pork jerky was great and the sauce it came with paired really well with it. \n\nI think we probably ordered almost everything on the menu because our group was so big, everything I tried was really really good! But my favorites were the Short Rib Fried Rice and the Awesome Noodles with beef.\n\nThis place is a great example of what they are trying to do DTLV to revitalize the area, I will definitely be back.\n\nMY GO-TO: I don't think you can go wrong here...

The fried chicken appetizer is fantastic! The sauce that comes with it is hot with some sour cream tang (siracha mixed with sour cream and mint perhaps?...). The drunken noodle everyone raves about is definetly tasty and hits the spot. The chicken satay is not worth it- too dry. Although, the size of the satay is huge! Like whole chicken breast huge. It is a little off from the tourist area and there seems to be a lot of locals who hang out here. I would recommend this place if you are in the area as this is a good break from the crowd.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	EsbKVP-eBkThZ4XqrOppJA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

bzwmvRUMEoz_UPfcYHIIXg	5	2012-02-12 00:00:00	I am going to straight-up admit: I've fallen in love with this place.\n\nIt's true!  This is top-notch Thai food.  So much so, that I think about it often, and come up with the lamest of excuses to justify going there.  Friends and family coming into town?  Oh, you're going here.  Friends IN town?  "Say.... We haven't hung out in a while.  There's this new little Thai place that opened up downtown...."\n\nJust the other night, I hit the missus up to go.\n\nHer: "But we just went not that long ago.  Do you really want to go back now?"\n\nMe: "Yes, because, uh, my shoes are brown, and that is to say... just get in the car, woman!"\n\n(This last scene will make for a lovely depiction in a teleplay I'm working on.  Words currently fail it.)\n\nRegardless, since my initial visit, I've made it a point to sample more of their dishes, and while I am still horribly, HORRIBLY enraptured with their "Awesome Noodles", their other stuff is remarkable.  Even their specialty drinks are excellent (I've yet to try the one with the grape rum and lemonade, but that's next).  To date, nothing has dissatisfied me.  The wait time, the service, the food....  It's bad enough I'm in the area all the time.  I start getting the crazy-twitches just thinking about it.\n\nAs much as I love the neighboring Kabob Korner for their mighty gyros, Le Thai is now my new favorite Thai place.  That little strip of street is becoming dangerous for me as all I want to do is eat when I pass down that area.\n\nOh, who am I kidding?  I'll probably be back down there within a week, and Le Thai and I both know it.\n\nUntil that next time....	5	4	4	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	H3wPBzQCKCKiHcV7GZK4kg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The prices are very reasonable and coming to the main part - The FOOD. The food is just OMG.

But I came for my last time in a few weeks back and the manager (?) or owner (?) went up to my friend and acted horrendously.  \n\nSome background:\nAs a group (a month or so ago) we called ahead and asked  for a reservation since it was our friend's birthday and we wanted to do Thai for lunch.  We were told over the phone by one employee that they don't do reservations, but we could order ahead and they would make sure a table was held open for us (not sure why that isn't a "reservation").  \nWhen we arrived at the restaurant, we walked in and the place was full except for one table with a "reserved" sign sitting on it.  We assumed it was ours.  But when we tried to claim it, we were told we couldn't sit there and they didn't have a table saved for us.  The woman we spoke with was abrupt and rude.  When we explained that we called ahead and were told that a table would be waiting for us, she sharply told us that no one would have said that because they don't take reservations.\n\nFast forward to a few weeks ago.\nI went in with my friend for dinner.  Just after we sat down, I left to use the restroom and when I came back, I found we'd been asked to leave.  Apparently a woman working there (the manager? or owner?) came over to my friend and asked if she was the same person who had problems during the birthday lunch.  My friend said that she was one of the people that was there for the birthday lunch (expecting an apology).  The female employee showed my friend a receipt for the food we didn't eat and explained how much money the store had lost because of her.  My friend asked if the woman wanted us to pay for the meal we didn't eat and the woman replied that she just wanted my friend to know what she had cost the restaurant.\n\nWow.  This person runs a restaurant and thinks this is acceptable.  \n\nI mean, I'd love to come back for the Awesome Noodles, but I can't support someone who is so passive-aggressive and thinks its okay to treat a customer like that.	17	2	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I told her no, but if you work there why would you leave your phone on the bar counter. It gets worse am already outside and someone chases me down and asks me again if I have her phone, I tell her no would you like to check my pockets? I was upset but I didn't lose my temper.

Should have gone with 3. The wait staff were very friendly and accommodating to our larger party. One of our guys even redeemed a hug coupon with one of the waitresses. \n\nI wish we could have gone out on the patio but we were the ones that surprised them with a larger group on short notice. The patio was already pretty full but looked very inviting. We were seated in the front area and even with the door open, the place was quiet enough for us to have normal volume conversation. \n\nI'm really hoping to find a place nearly this good up my way.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ef-tOVUX4jia92SCXugghg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
cAZO6EHFhwHMc-dKnNGWCg	5	2013-05-07 00:00:00	I first read about this place in "Eating Las Vegas- The 50 Essential Restaurants" and was excited to see a place from downtown make the list.  I am a big fan of Thai (Pad Thai specifically) and while I've found a few good places, I haven't found anything which I return to on a normal basis.\n\nThis place is small, located on East Fremont street in the vicinity of Commonwealth.  Wait was 60 min for a party of 3, but the cool thing is they send you a text with a website to track your place in line, so my party was able to venture off to other places and let the hour fly by.\n\nLe Thai has a very downtown feel which is different from other Vegas establishments, the small kitchen is right off the dining area and they have an outdoor section.  The menu is pretty simple and I'd say most if not all of the items were under $15.\n\nI had a spring roll and Pad Thai w/ Chicken and it was a very reasonable portion!  The noodles had a bit of spice for ordering mild, but I welcomed it.  For the price and quality of food I felt this place blew Lotus of Siam out of the water and will now become my "go to" Thai place.	2	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	M-xJMhi-HphpWaD2992K3A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
CDXnMVlXFKQBW7HT2rApeA	3	2012-09-16 00:00:00	A little Thai restaurant located down on Fremont Street, Le Thai's one of those unassuming restaurants that you might not notice at first glance if you're walking down Fremont Street. \n\nRESTAURANT\nThere isn't much seating inside the restaurant, which I've noticed can fill up fast during lunch time. No sweat, there's a shaded dining area outside. My friend and I lunched out there during 100+ degree temps, so it was literally "no sweat" because the space is well-equipped with misters. \n\nFOOD\nPanang (tofu) with Brown Rice:  I ordered  a spicy level 3 out of their 1-5 scale, which wasn't spicy enough for me. Hardly was there any kick to my curry, but this might be due to the fact that the rice was mixed into my dish. Can't say I'm a fan of that because I don't eat much rice to begin with, and I didn't have control over how much rice I wanted to consume (I can't go into work and fall into a rice coma while at my computer.). But in all seriousness, I wasn't expecting that because I'm accustomed to having rice served on the side.  As for the Panang Tofu, it receives an OK in my book, though I like how there were bamboo shoots.  \n\nSERVICE\nIt was on the slow side. Unsure if it was because it became busier inside. \n\nOVERALL\nService is slow, but the food isn't bad if you're looking for something decent and a little healthier to eat among the dining choices in Downtown.	5	2	4	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	epkRB3J_oBEiyiwahvdmGg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It's totally worth it. \n\nThe three curry chicken was simply outstanding, and I can't wait to try it again. The pad prik is also top notch. Try some of their Asian beers with your meal.\n\nWarning: the "medium" setting on their food is usually enough to make your eyeballs sweat, and I love hot food. It's the kind of heat you don't taste right away, but you start to feel soon after. \n\nDon't forget to do your Yelp check in. It's a "free hug", and the staff always smiles and gives you one.\n\nYou have to try this place.	4	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	kGGapvfP1SZH2ZOikdSpNA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
CFXbqABfRHwWsbuFhcV2wQ	5	2014-09-21 00:00:00	Easily my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas.  The short rib fried rice with the signature waterfall sauce is unreal and I find myself craving it almost every week.  The pad thai is unique and amazing, the portion size is actually manageable as far as thai restaurants go, and the chicken satay with peanut sauce is the perfect appetizer or even main course.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	JeqBomG6ef5KsKCmXlLKDA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
cGdTq0plmYKn7PKwUybfKA	1	2012-05-04 00:00:00	I don't know WTH happened on my visit, but it was not good.\n\nMy co-worker and I decided to check out Le Thai for lunch after reading and hearing the rave reviews.  We were seated outside after a 10 minute wait or so, which is typical at popping restaurant during lunchtime.  But things soon went downhill from there . . . \n\nAfter taking our orders, my yellow curry took approximately 35-40 minutes to come out.  I had to ask for utensils twice once my food came out.  At the 45-50 minute point, my co-worker and I decided that we couldn't stay to eat and would need to take our food to go.  So we asked that her food (which hadn't come out yet) be placed in a container and asked for a container for my food.                \n\nThe waiter brought me a small, wire handle take out box.  Mind you, my bowl of yellow curry was pretty big and I hadn't eaten much of it.  I pointed this out to him and asked if I could get a bigger container, like my co-worker's, i.e., the round 7" take out container.\n\nThe waiter took my food and the small take out box to the kitchen; BUT instead of packing my food into a bigger container like I asked, he came back with my food packed into the one, small take out box!!!  There's no way that my big bowl of curry fit into that small container, which means I paid for food that I did not eat or take with me.\n\nBy this point, we were really hungry and so ready to go.  I gave the waiter my card to pay, only to have him come back and say that their machine was down.  We waited approximately another 10 minutes, before he came back and said the machine was indefinitely down.  He then suggested we go to an ATM down the street and take out cash, or that we could speak with the manager to make "arrangements."  WHAT?!?!?!?!\n\nI'm not sure if the other waiter was out sick that day or what happened.  But we spent almost an hour and a half waiting for our food and/or trying to pay and leave.  We didn't get to eat until we got back to work.  I'm really sad because it was good but I just can't get over the trauma of bad service that day . . .	4	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

CIHxVFHy-BVtHa1kE5DuPQ	4	2014-08-04 00:00:00	Such good Thai food.  I brought two of my Thai afficionado friends - one that's worked at an authentic Thai restaurant and another that traveled and ate her way through Thailand ----both loved it. \n\nTHe staff here is great--- I came here during a lazy saturday one day, and my gf and i sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender.  He gave us free shots of a thai whiskey and a BJ shot for her bday (although it might've been more for his own entertainment) \n\nI have to qualify my review and admit that the joint is pricey compared to typical Thai food. i.e., the short-rib fried rice (savory, delicious chunks of meat) is 13$, and that's not including the fried egg you Have to get on top. I believe most curries are around 10$ if you're getting regular meat, closer to 13$ if you get shrimp. \n\nThat said the food is good enough that i've came here twice in 1 day... albeit drunk the second time. \n\nHowever, you're guaranteed to have a flavor packed dish And their cocktails are legit. They have great, refreshing fruity-but not overly sweet drinks...i.e., Hendricks cucumber martini (so cucumbery but has a bite), Thailup (Thai style Mojito made with tamarind), and a Pear-tini, sounds super girly, but my bf got it and loved it. HA! \n\nEven better they're open til 2am and the food makes for amazing drunk munchies. \n\nNot to mention you have great establishments just across the street, i.e., Downtown cocktail room.	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	WlBQRynXJi8tbrnNh5V84g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Reminds me of places in Thailand.\n\nThe best: pork jerk was delicious and unique with a spicy dipping sauce with a side of sticky rice. Service was great.\n\nThe good: the awesome flat noodle at 3star hot actually wasn't hot. It hand a subtle sweet taste to it and was enjoyable.\n\nThe bad: papaya salad was just really tough and presented a lot of work.

cqDMoTh1F_O-arfmbB_QPA	1	2015-02-20 00:00:00	My girlfriend and I ordered pad thai and curry at a safe spice level 3 and oh god it was hot. So much chili oil we couldn't finished and ended up ruining our evening in Las Vegas. The small amount we did eat caused upset stomachs.  The server made no mention of "thai hot" during ordering, once we brought it up he tried to pass it off as a normal. A touristy place cant act like that they don't tell people the food is hot because their regulars expect it.  We are not amateurs, hell can freeze over before that's a #3. Their solution was a free $3.00 thai ice tea sugar bomb. Hot is not just chili oil, from the flavor we could taste you are better off at one of many other thai places in vegas.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	cQQtorFiUHrUU2TW7gowWg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

crJcMXtQYfC42lR_eVxVvA	5	2015-02-25 00:00:00	Franks new Vegas Thai food place is Le Thai! Located on the Fremont Street experiance the great Buddah has blessed us and enlightened our taste buds with this fine establishment. I'm a huge Thai food fan and not all places measure up to my standards, but Le Thai exceded my standards.\n\nNow because the restaurant is small you may have a wait, but the host will page your cell phone when you table is ready. Le Thai's menu is small but everything is flavorful and delicious. The flavor explosion will melt your mind and taste buds. You'll not be disappointed in the array of thai spices used to create your food. Now Frank ordered many items to sample from but it's started off with a glass of there Thai Ice Tea. A sweet tasting refreshing beverage the will satisfy your thirst. \n\nWaterfall Beef is awesome an amazing way to start your meal . The Thai "beef" Salad exceeded my expectations with all the flavors that came out of it. If you've always wondered what the perfect salad was then order this one. Now for your main items the short rib rice ushered me into the new wave of rice dishes. The short rib meat added a sweet flavoring to fried rice like I've never experience before and I loved it. And let's not forget about the Pad Thai noodle dish, because it was off the flavor chart. A perfect 10 for Pad Thai dishes and it shows. This place may be small but it's culinary dishes give it a huge restaurant presence in Vegas. I can't wait to eat here again.\n\nMake sure you check into YELP so you can get "FREE HUG" coupon. It's a life saver after the food.	5	3	5	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	MeDuKsZcnI3IU2g7OlV-hQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Our hostess told us the wait time would be around 15-20 mins. We ended up waiting 45 mins with no update information or apology. Another party of two was seated as soon as they walked in. We had to approach her and ask why we hadn't been seated. She said they were just seated there but aren't able to order because the cooks had too many tickets? After bragging about how amazing this place was I was livid and eating my words instead actual food. Because of this incident, I will no longer eat or recommend that poor excuse for a restaurant to anybody. That hostess has the worst customer service and should be in the kitchen where socializing with customers is non-existent!	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	__O0qQmpa8uwgF5Ln9CkwQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The salsa had little flavor as well!  The location was perfect for us though being downtown.  I enjoyed the quick awesome service but I personal was not a fan at all.   Even if prices were much lower there was no flavor to me .... Maybe it was an off day though.   I understand that happens from time to time!

I'm a sucker for good Thai food, so when she said it was authentic, needless to say I was beyond psyched and couldn't wait to go to sleep to have lunch here the following day. We arrived and had to wait a few minutes before our table was ready. No biggie, we took the time to take pictures of course! Our table was ready and we sat outside - I now understood what "authentic" really meant - it was a blazing hot day and we sat in the back with fans blowing - I could totally picture myself in Thailand in the same atmosphere! We ordered a bunch of dishes to try: chicken pad Thai, yellow curry, green curry and some appetizers - this is where the authentic comes in! The food was so rich and flavorful! We were so full, but couldn't stop eating! Shame on me, but I never had the sticky rice with mango, so as stuffed as we all were, we shared an order! The rice was cooked perfectly, the mango was sweet and the combination of the two truly works! When I'm back for my yearly visit to Sin City to visit the BFF, I will, without a doubt, be making sure this is on the list!

Cuyd1EqkMpnu1eXXsj2dMQ	5	2017-03-06 00:00:00	Great location, right in the heart of downtown Vegas, and great ambience inside. They have a back patio area that is 10 feet away from the hustle and bustle of Fremont street, but without the noise and chaos, and they keep it shaded and cool with fans and misters in the summer. It isn't an option during the chilly winter days unless you have thick skin that can handle the cold. \n\nThe food has quality ingredients and is presented well. My favorite is the waterfall beef with waterfall sauce. It is amazing and you won't find it anywhere else. I asked them about the sauce and it is an original and they are not giving out the recipe. \n\nThe service is quick and on point, but this place is a local hotspot, so don't be surprised you may have to wait 30 min to an hour to get seated. Make reservations first, or order pick up and hope a front patio table is open. The inside dining area doesn't hold many and can get kind of cramped. The outside doesn't hold many either, but is a little more spacious and quiet.\n\nIt's not my first pick in Thai restaurants, but the waterfall beef, the location, and the ambience put it high on my list.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	uso43PtZRUPcYxgxs12U1g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

CxFARCbqmQp7dRYisPrKEg	4	2013-07-08 00:00:00	I had been dying to try this place out for a while now because I've read so many great things about it.  Instead of going to First Friday, my friend and I decided to beat the crowd and head to Fremont Street a little early and get some drinks.  To my pleasant surprise, Le Thai was not very busy at all.  \n\nThe restaurant is quite small with about 4-5 tables inside and a bar seating area that seats about 8 as well as the actual bar that seats about 8.  It also has a back patio that has tables, as well as a front patio section.  It's cute inside, but it was warm.  Granted, it was about 110 outside, the AC was probably having a hard time keeping up.\n\nAnyway, our server was nice but not very attentive.  We placed our food order and told him we'd order drinks in a second since we never got a drink menu and had to ask him for it.  He never came back to get our drink order so we asked the SA who dropped off our food and he had to go find him for us.  Also, they dropped off food but never gave us untensils, so we also asked the server when he came to get our drink order.\n\nWe ordered the waterfall beef, which comes with a side of sticky rice.  Holy YUMMO!  This dish is out of this world.  I could just eat this all day long.  It totally reminds me of food my mom used to make for us growing up.  SO EFFIN BOMB.  It's basically sauteed beef drenched in this lime/fish sauce.  The sauce wasn't very potent so those opposed to fish sauce might still even like it.  I, however, LOVED it and was drenching my sticky rice with it.  \n\nWe also ordered some Pad Thai to share. On a scale of 1-5 spicy level, I ordered a 2 and it was dang spicy!  Even my friend, who loves spicy, agreed that it was quite spicy.  Despite that, it was freakin' delicious.  It's some of the best pad thai I've ever had.  \n\nThe food here is off the chain.  I want to go back and try EVERYHING on the menu!  They have larb and I wanna see how authentic it tastes, coming from a family where my mom grew up in Thailand and cooked Thai-style food my entire childhood.

C_SsHRdY8gNMOQu7MVAJXg	4	2014-07-27 00:00:00	Le Thai is a slightly overpriced Thai restaurant that gets my vote based on their G-O-R-G-E-O-U-S patio outside.  I love that patio because it's covered, shady, and makes you feel like you're in a little oasis in the middle of downtown Vegas.\n\nAs I said, when you're used to going to places like Archie's Thai or Pan Asia, the sticker price here is a little, "Ahhh!" but it is very good Thai food.  My favorite dish is the Three Color Curry which mixes red, yellow, and green.  Have you ever thought, "Man, I could really go for some red curry right now, but I want potatoes in it like yellow curry."  Well, Three Color Curry is the best of all three curry worlds.  The spice levels here are intense, so go low if you're not sure.\n\nI've also had the pad thai and the ga pow (basil stir fry).  All of the food here is full of flavor and they offer the option of brown rice at no extra charge!  Side note, their cocktail menu is quite good, which I didn't expect at a Thai restaurant.  I especially enjoyed the Lady Boy and the one with champagne and St. Germaine (I can't remember the name of that one!).\n\nThe trick is to come for the lunch special, which is even honored on Saturdays!  You get an entree and a drink for only $9.95.  They also have a nice Happy Hour menu with apps and drink specials (again, EVEN ON SATURDAY!).	2	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Fair pricing.\n\nI've dined in many so-called "Thai" restaurants but very few of them actually produce a well-made Thai meal.  This place creates dishes that are very delicious and traditional.\n\nThis was a welcome change from a lot of the "factory-food" that is found in Vegas.\n\nIt was also nice to pay a fair price for a generous portion.\n\nNext time I am in Le Vegas, I'm heading right to Le Thai.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	KrQWRX52RtRA66gF1zrW8A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The staff is very polite, they're still learning as it is the soft open but they've been accommodating and kept a clean dining area. \n\nOverall it's a nice quiet spot to grab a bite downtown and it's great if you have vegetarian friends that don't feel like hitting one of the 80 steakhouses featured downtown.\n\nReally love that curry!	2	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	z9MwKFs-CFzMQdwSOgHleA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

D2nbM6braeXdvyv7eKED3A	4	2014-02-13 00:00:00	We visited Le Thai for a bday dinner on 2/11/14. Aside from having a reservation for 12 and still having to wait for 15 minutes,  the food and service were excellent. \n\nWe all very much enjoyed the food, the curry was absolutely yummy and the price was extremely reasonable.  For 12 people with drinks our bill was only $170.00 I do not care for restaurants that automatically add gratuity for large parties and was pleased to see that they did not do that. As an industry worker dependent on tips I like to tip more than the average person but when an auto gratuity is added I do not care to bother with the math, unless the service was exceptional!  \n\nDefinitely a great place to visit for a good time with friends and family. We will be back for more yummy goodness.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	z72-arTJkduONFATfOZLVg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It's just not particularly authentic, but I suppose that's typical of most places downtown. \n\nI was warned that the food was quite spicy, and that I should be careful. I am a huge fan of spicy food, but decided to be cautious. I asked for a 3 1/2 out of 5 spice. It was disappointingly mild, I'd barely call it a 1/5. Still, the food did have a nice flavor. \n\nI would most definitely eat here again if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it.	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	A0hxaeKlrnObsikUUMVO8Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

dFCARrITN6om8gQtA9EShg	5	2016-01-07 00:00:00	Oh man, this is a great restaurant.  I've never really been to Fremont street, but next time I'm in Las Vegas I'm staying there, eating here, and spending more time in this area.\n\nWe parked at a nearby lot for $3 an hour and walked on in.  We were quickly seated by a friendly host and given menus.  We looked them over and decided to go with the Thai wings, the short rib fried rice, and the 3 color (red, green, yellow) curry.\n\nWe were given some spicy peanuts to snack on while we waited for our wings.  After around 5 or 6 minutes from the time we ordered the wings were out.  They were fantastic.  I have no idea what makes a wing a 'Thai Wing', but what I do know is that these were some amazing wings.  The sriacha ranch sauce was a perfect complement to the crispy wings, and we ate them up in no time.  Seriously, get these as an appetizer.  We wanted them as the entire meal, up until we got the rest of our meal!\n\nThe rest of the meal came out just as we were finishing the wings.  Both dishes were excellent.  The 3 color curry was awesome.  They didn't go easy on the meat like a lot of places do, and there was tons of good vegetables in it.  I could have eaten the fried rice for a long time.  I will say that I wish I had gone hotter on the curry, but it's always hard to decide what spicy level to do on your first time at a new place.  \n\nOverall this was an amazing meal.  This was our last meal on a week long trip through Phoenix, San Diego, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas, and this was by far my favorite meal.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	wxuVZTfo1pThbqfzz97uLg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

This restaurant has filled a need for not just a great Thai restaurant downtown but just a great restaurant downtown. There is not one dish I wouldn't recommend.  My favorite's the Thai salad.\n\nTypical lunch crowd consists of table-fuls of Zappos people, talking Downtown projects or lawyers coming up for air from 16.1 discovery.   Night time is a more eclectic assortment of people, unified in their readiness to sample the bar as much as the food.\n\nThe staff is always nice even when they're busy.  I can easily eat there everyday. But I'm Asian, so eating Asian isn't out of the norm, it's like eating pizza and hamburgers all the time for Americans.  The only competition with the food is the great ambiance.   A late lunch with a good friend can easily turn into a early start on the weekend with drinks.  Life is good here at Le Thai.	2	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	2BVSjX0-XonYpEAKMRHocg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Seemed like it had a cool vibe when I walked in and I had high expectations based on all the 4 and 5 star reviews, but sadly the poor service let that vibe slip away.  The food (panang curry and pork jerky) isn't any better than most other "average" Thai restaurants in Vegas.  Prices are also on the high side for what you get.

I looked up their number on their website but had to visit yelp for the number because they didn't list it on their site?  When I called, I received the VM stating to call back or email them.  I sent an email requesting a reservation for 4 ppl.  The nice lady called me back stating reservations are only taken for larger groups.  Normally I wouldn't care but it is 40 degrees and a Wednesday.  I'm officially turned off by this policy and will maybe revisit if this changes but until then a customer has been lost.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	KB6lhN1M-pUzPWXia2iTEQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
dvKcnHv4DHa9DnM_jHB2XA	5	2012-02-08 00:00:00	I'm so glad we're getting some urban eats in the Downtown area!  This place makes me feel like I'm in some Bladerunner-esque crowded noodle bar - but with better food.  I'm partial to the three-color curry with tofu - I don't consider myself a heat wimp, but a 1 is good enough for me.  Just a nice amount of warmth that doesn't interfere with actually tasting the food. Having a gallery across the street I always run into someone I know while eating here, so it feels like a neighborhood joint, which is something I've missed since moving to Vegas.

DWQTdJj3nq7QJ59EAmu0Fg	3	2012-03-25 00:00:00	Le Thai had come highly recommended by a friend.  The restaurant is located on Fremont Street, in an very accessible area.  Parking was not a problem even on a Saturday night.  We had dinner reservations and didn't really wait at all to get seated.  We went with whole family eight of us total.  We sampled a good variety of their fare.\n\n We began the evening with appetizers a variety of chicken wings, the Thai ones were best.  The spring rolls were also very tasty, then chicken skewers with a delicious peanut dipping sauce and slaw.  My very favorite appetizer was the fried pork pieces with sticky rice, and a spicy light Thai sauce for dipping on the side.  It was absolutely delicious. Which I would have made that dish my dinner.\n\nUnfortunately, was really not as thrilled with the dinner entrees.  My opinion seemed to be echoed by our entire table.  We all were very thrilled with our appetizer dinner was just so- so to us.  We sampled all typed of Pad Thais with a variety of different meats and condiments, yet most seemed unimpressive.  I personally had as my choice a beef stir-fry with vegetables and brown rice.  Just didn't seem to pack the same flavor on the entrees as my old time favorite Restaurant  Ping Kao on Rainbow and Lake Mead.  With eight of us there ordering a huge variety felt i was able to sample enough to gather an opinion.  \n\nWould I go back? Heck yes, the location is great, atmosphere super trendy,  and the service was o.k.  I would just stick to drinks and the appetizers more so.  Also if you don't like very loud music playing, you may want to pass.  I enjoy music but was so loud, hard to talk with our dinner party at times.  \n\nMarisol Juracka, Lv, Nv	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	R12HkYTrMgpXPVxrj8Yj7Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
dxPUHiEBAs21PcQ1HA4auQ	3	2013-02-08 00:00:00	I really hate to, but I have to downgrade. The service here is just not up to snuff to remain at four stars.\n\nThe first time I visited, I called the waitress a dark cloud over the meal. Truly. This last time, we sat for a half an hour waiting to pay before I went to find the waitress, split the bill myself, so we could leave. As I was walking back with the ticket book in my hand, some other annoyed customers asked if I would run their cards (thinking that I worked there), so I can only assume that they were waiting forever as well. \n\nAlso, that ordering system by looking at the iPhone is straight up rude. There is a way to look like you are engaged with your customers while holding a phone in your hand, and they need to master this. \n\nThe food is really tasty, but the prices went up a couple dollars since I was last there, and the service was still lacking. \n\nI just know not to have the highest of expectations because I'm sure I'll be back eventually. Good food, sad service.	12	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ugNQV0isqQSAuuGzoK87sQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
dYIrXBp6z0xyLl5PSBqsyg	5	2015-12-13 00:00:00	I could not be happier with Le Thai. I have been several times and it has always been good!\nThere is usually a wait to get in, so get on the list in advance.\nI stick to Pad Thai and Curry, because they are my personal favorites. Favorite Curry is the 3 Color Curry. I favor the regular Pad Thai with Tofu. But I hear the Pad Kee Mow is great too.\nI usually go for a heat rating of #4 aka Fire, which is hot. Not for beginners.\nIt is worth the wait and trying to find parking.\nI will be back and I would definitely recommend this place!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	GM03_rIOE0Q1aCuq0jM_XA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

D_P9lhIA9c_WpBUBG6Py4w	4	2012-01-12 00:00:00	LOCATION: I've walked past Le Thai so many times without ever realizing it. They don't have a sign! I went there specifically looking for it and nearly walked past it.  I frequent Vanguard and its literally directly across the street.\n\nAMBIANCE: Walking in, I immediately noticed the small space has such a pleasant decor that feels very home-y and welcoming. Lots of wood, wicker chairs, and an exposed brick wall--almost like a hipster apartment. I chose to sit at a table but you can opt to sit at the bar as well. \n\nFOOD: The whole food menu fits on the back of the beverage selection menu. Makes sense, small restaurant small menu? But it won't disappoint. The menu is small but mighty. There's a selection of appetizers, soups, stir-frys, & curry. I was dining solo so I didn't get to sample much: Thai Chicken Wings & Chicken Ga Pow (Basil Stir-Fry). Chicken Wings were perfectly fried and quite spicy (in a good way) and the sriracha ranch it was served with was addicting! The Ga Pow had a kick. Wish it had a little more fish sauce but it was definitely some of the best stir-fry I'd ordered at a thai restaurant! Next time, I'm taking on the curry!!! I've heard only good things about it.\n\nDRINKS: Decent size beer & sake selection. I was sick so I went for the House Green Tea. \n\nSERVICE: When I first arrived, I felt like they were too busy to pay attention to me. They were taking a bit too long to take my order and they didn't come around enough to check on me or to refill my water. But as it got a little later and the place started filling up, I felt the servers became more attentive and the service got better. One thing, why you so stingy on napkins? Thai food means runny noses! I need more than one napkin at a time. \n\nI'll be back!!	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	AL4hosjTZzsLt99egmBszA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
D_xFPUe3XuLZib0A9qs9Lg	4	2016-10-01 00:00:00	Everyone recommended Le Thai, so we had to try it. We were told it was a wait of 20 min, but we were seated not even five minutes later. Its food is quite authentic and the ambiance very cozy and colorful. I had the Thai salad with beef, at a spicy level of 3. I enjoyed it and it filled me up. Filled with spices and tastiness. Friends enjoyed their curry and chicken wings. It's a good place for a date. Our waiter was also very cool. Check it out when you're in town.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	wce0tudXf9BCeWhQRr0TiA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
E45uMYzprmF2qhEK9bdtFA	5	2015-02-17 00:00:00	We arrived at 11:30 and were seated by 12:10. Probably not great for the lunch crowd who works nearby. There's plenty to see in the area so you can check in and leave a phone number with them so that they can call you when your table is ready.\n\nBe prepared to pay almost twice what you would at most casual Thai restaurants and be aware that they have a very limited menu, which you can see on the web at www.lethaivegas.com\n\nThe food comes out quick and very hot. The taste was fantastic. The spice levels are 1-5 and according to my wife, the 2 was hotter than she was accustomed to so if you have any doubts, go low. I thought the level 5 was just right for those of us who really like it hot.\n\nWe will definitely return to Le Thai.\n\nEdit: We are back for dinner a day later at ten minutes until five and no wait at all. \n\n\n\nService both days has been great. The food is still fantastic. Don't miss this if you're in Vegas. Even if you don't think you'd like Thai food you should take a chance; I doubt you'll regret it.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	yew4avMVFoqrHLNZpKfxCw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
E5eo_uFaPjWKJQb7zdiNRQ	3	2014-10-31 00:00:00	Le Thai is a cool little Thai venue in Downtown Las Vegas but was a little disappointed after perhaps too high expectations.  \n\nComing right before the Life is Beautiful Festival began, my friend and I stopped by around noon on a Saturday and were lucky enough to get bar seats.  The place isn't huge but has a small outdoor patio area as well as tables and a few bar seats.  A full bar awaited as well with a great selection of various Thai-inspired cocktails and Asian beers/wines.  \n\nSo for the taste.  Drinks-wise, we both got the Spiked Thai Iced Tea which I thought was clever.  Taste-wise, I was a little more disappointed as the whiskey I believe overpowered the totality of the Thai Iced tea here.  Maybe it needed more of the Thai Iced Tea but the balance was a bit off.  \n\nFood-wise, they have a bunch of normal Thai dishes like the papaya salads and yellow curry.  I got the awesome flat noodle (which reminded me most of the pad see ewe mixed with the pad thai type of ingredients).  It came with a choice of protein (I got chicken) and the end taste was okay.  It wasn't too different from most Thai joints and I had to add a lot of spices to get it up to what I did want.  (They did also ask for a level of 1-5 spicy level which isn't always common in Thai restaurants).  The best thing I did have was the roti omlette dessert which was absolutely delicious.  Filled with nutella and a fried egg on top of a bread on the bottom, it was a solid dessert.  \n\nService-wise, everyone was really nice and accommodating, even with all the busy atmosphere.  \n\nVenue-wise, I loved the look and atmosphere of the place.  It had a very silly take on Thai food that wasn't too serious and liked the interplay.   \n\nCost-wise, it was very affordable with the check only about $20 per person in the end.  \n\nAgain, Le Thai was pretty cool (more of a 3 1/2 stars) but taste-wise, I wasn't fully convinced in my first visit.  Hope to come back and try it again and be proven wrong in the near future.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	PVVIVG2HJHXWTkgR9fTfIQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
E7WPUNrAiv-2yLqtZJdURQ	3	2017-05-09 00:00:00	Good location. Cozy ambiance. Not the biggest menu, but the food was pretty tasty. My cocktail, this Japanese whiskey ginger, was amazing! But on the small size. I wanted another, but never got a chance to ask or was asked if I would like another. The service was pathetic for Vegas. \n\nThe staff was so unorganized, I don't even know who our server was. One of our apps was forgotten, and we had to ask several times if it was still coming.  All 3 drinks were brought at different times, needing reminders for two. We had to ask multiple times every time we needed something. Never asked if we wanted something else to drink when our drinks were gone. Never checked up on us. They majorly dropped the ball on good service. For the wait they usually have and so many more options, I won't be back my next time to Vegas.	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	sj6obbeQrBkm9HfZo1TmRg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
e8nvwizE4tbzl6xVW3Ebog	4	2012-11-08 00:00:00	Stumbled across this place for lunch.. \n\nWe went in and we're told there was about a 15 minute wait. There were tables open, but we guess they didn't want to back the kitchen up. Hostess was nice, but never acknowleged why there was a wait. \nSo we waited outside with others that said it was great and worth the wait. \n\nOnce seated the waitress was extremely helpful describing the dishes we were unsure of... \n\nWe ordered the Tom Yum soup & Vegetable Stir Fry. \nThe Tom Yum spicy factor was a 2 out of 5.. still pretty hot.. Flavor was incredible. of hot & sour with lots of mushrooms, tomatoes & chicken. \n\nVegetable Stir Fry with Beef was cooked perfectly, tender vegetables and plenty of meat served on your choice of white or brown rice. \n\nThe lunch specials included a drink for $8.95, which is a great deal. \n\nDowntown is really getting a variety of great restaurants!

e8VfYzE66k8G_-UWJ7kJqw	5	2015-07-08 00:00:00	Located on the busy streets of Downtown, Le Thai sits as a hidden gem. I had heard very good things about Le Thai from a few people, but never had the chance to try it. After watching countless videos about traveling to Thailand, I found myself craving the spicy, flavor filled dishes that Thai cuisine has to offer. Since I was Downtown, I decided it was finally time to make my journey to Le Thai. \n\nLe Thai has quite a few classic and much loved Thai dishes to choose from, but these two are my favorite:\n\nPork Jerky: The pork jerky is served with sticky rice and waterfall sauce. If you've never had this dish before, you take a small portion of the sticky rice and wrap it around a piece of jerky. After that, take the jerky/sticky rice combo and dip it in the waterfall sauce!The waterfall sauce is some of the best I've tried here in Vegas. It's super flavorful and really gives the jerky that punch of added flavor. \n\nChicken Fried Rice: People have different opinions about the fried rice here at Le Thai, but when I tried it for the first time I proclaimed to my friends that it was the best fried rice I had ever tasted. There is so much flavor in Le Thai's chicken fried rice, you just have to try it to see what i mean.\n\nTry these two dishes and I promise you won't be disappointed! Here are a couple quick tips:\n\n- Happy Hour is Mon-Fri from 3-6pm & Saturday from 11 am - 4 pm. They have a lot of appetizers to choose from and drinks as well.\n\n- They have spice level options for their dishes. It ranges from 0 (no spicy) - 5 (bring the heat!)\n\nNext time you're craving Thai food, you know where to go.	3	0	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Nh-ztLj1IxS8ROHQqDFSiQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
E9jdv0z3XKhC_-bht8wrxg	2	2014-09-14 00:00:00	This place has gotten too big for its britches.  Since opening, prices have gone up (fine) and quality has slipped (unacceptable)--mostly a consistency issue.  All that said, it's still delicious and really hits the spot when you've been drinking the last few hours at the downtown bars.\n\nUnfortunately, the dreaded 45 minute wait has become far more consistent than the food.  This would almost be tolerable if not for the fact that there are multiple counter seats open with literally nobody waiting out front every single time.  And the hostesses are almost always rudely flippant about it..  And they don't take reservations for parties less than 4.  So it appears the method to getting a table if you really want one is to put your name on the list and go drink for another 45 minutes while they squander open seating waiting for everyone else doing this to come back.\n\nAs far as the food, the pork jerky, pad kee mow, shortrib fried rice, and eggplant dish are the best.  The beef soup is pretty good but always too salty.  The Pad Thai is serviceable.  Spice level is a bit inconsistent, tending on the hot side, but not really any moreso than other Thai places.  My advice to others would be to consider the dish's impact on spice, e.g. pad kee mow 3 is much much hotter than shortrib fried rice 3.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	5v-aMWCpiJ-nroqk88J_qA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

eaGzmX18yWcfgXb2Zlavgg	5	2013-06-21 00:00:00	We were there again last night and they now only take reservations for large parties which is great since it's so small.  Happy hour is until 6 and the drinks are a real deal with my large Change beer for $5 instead of $9 and premium liquor is on sale as well in addition to some of their speciality drinks and wine. A few appetizers are also on the happy hour menu.  The food is as good as always and we have finally figured out the various spice levels for the entrees we like.  For some reason the ginger fried rice really needs a 4 but the Tom Yum soup is very spicy at a level 2 and the other dishes we usually go with a 3 and they are perfect.  We had a great service from Olivia who is a new server and if you have the option, you should request her she was great.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	g4yPg9CHRbl25q7qcV1wGQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
eaqPrKkEN0HbcoIbRX5QaA	2	2013-09-04 00:00:00	I was here a few weeks ago and brought my family from out of town to eat near Fremont... Right off the bat I was greeted by a nice gentlemen and at the hostess stand. We were at in a back patio area which was outdoors and it was really hot out. Roughly 90-95 degree and it just rained. So it was humid too. It was really stuffy in the area, plus all the hot plates goin out and only 2-3 tables open so it was busy. I did not want my family to be eating in that type of environment. I decided to see if we can dine at the front. A new hostess was at the front and while my family was waiting at the front with me while I was asking if we can get served outside... The new hostess with tattoo's on her arm was probably the rudest hostess I've had to deal with in my 13years dining in Vegas. I've worked in f&b since I was a kid. If It wasn't my server Tia doing an awesome job. This would of gotten 1 star. Unless the hostess owns the joint I would of fired her on the spot. I'm a bartender in this town and a GM of a bar. I would not recommend this place to anyone I come across. Shows how important a first impression can ruin a whole meal.

EH95FPbG5yshas9-M2RV9w	4	2012-01-27 00:00:00	What do you get when you combine 7 Yelp Gals, a drink called a lady boy, and spicy Thai food? A FUN ASS NIGHT THAT'S WHAT. \n\nI went to Le Thai with 6 other ladies after having a few drinks around the corner at DCR. Le Thai is le tiny. If you have a group, do what we did and make a reservation. We were seated outside, which is a lovely area complete with heaters for those cool Vegas nights. And the music was fantastic! \n\nThe menu at Le Thai is small. You know those little cards some eateries put on tables to list their wines? That's the menu at Le Thai. Despite the small menu size there is still a nice variety of options to try. \n\nI don't recall what I ordered. I do recall that it was damn tasty. Unlike some of my fabulous friends, I am a big baby when it comes to spiciness... and I have had issues at other places around town making my food too spicy. This was not an issue at Le Thai at all, and from what I heard around the table, the ladies that do like it hot were pleased with the level of spice in their dishes. The Lady Boy drink was fantastic, I would have had 2 but we had another bar to hit. It's downtown, duh.\n\nIf you need an inexpensive and tasty meal while you are downtown, Le Thai is worth a try. I heard they have an actual sign now too, so it's easier to find!	5	2	4	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

EOu_OrPzx6IH7Xy1DUipHA	4	2016-01-25 00:00:00	Le Thai offers fresh and delicious food on a budget. I usually order the Tom Yum and Thai Beef & Meatball soup this time of year. The Tom Yum is sorta like a hot and sour soup (but better) that contains mushrooms, green onions, cilantro, tomato, lemon grass, and lemon juice. And for $10, it's not too bad considering it's huge and can easily feed two people. Other standouts are the ga pow, papaya salad, chicken satay, and fried bananas. The interior is cute but cramped and can get loud at times. Overall, a great spot to have lunch or a meal before hitting up the bars along Fremont.	2	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Jk7sjPeIFcaGO3IJOOQ1Pg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
ePDraVqkSK64dNMr6mRNSg	3	2014-02-01 00:00:00	I heard all my friends raving about how fabulous this place is. It is very small and very difficult to get a table so it is kind of exclusive. But is it worth the trouble to get there and get seated? I went with a group early and managed to get a table outside in winter but they had radiant heaters so aside from the food getting cold quickly it was mostly comfortable. It is family style and we all sampled most of the popular menu items. The Drunken Noodles are amazing and unique. Aside from that one dish I found the food very ordinary and boring. Can't understand why everyone was raving. There are far better choices around town with one nearby to this place (Lotus of Siam) being vastly superior (actually Lotus is superior to most places) but there are lots better than Le Thai. If you go try the drunken noodles.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	gxEcb6S1mxbJsTQWsJO2bA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
ePnRAn_ENXpQrcuUdmuYiA	4	2014-01-20 00:00:00	One of the few places worth eating at near Fremont, but that's not saying much.\n\nFood is over-priced.  Regardless, it tastes pretty good.  Not the best Thai in Vegas, and definitely better deals out there, but if you're in the area, it's worth checking out.\n\nFood is spicier than you'd expect if you're familiar with other Thai restaurants.  Be cautious.  \n\nHostess service is a bit rude.  Servers and bartenders are accommodating, though.\n\nUpdate: we've eaten here several times since the first review. The food is consistently good and keeps us coming back when we're downtown.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	HU4HLX32atPCkjItNsL0aA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Their papaya salad wasn't that appetizing because it wreaked of dried squid and tasted like dried squid. It would be better to add some spice in it to accommodate the taste. Overall food and service was good although there were some delays here and there but the employees were friendly and full of energy. Their menu is real simple and easy to choose from. I would definitely come here to eat and recommend this place to friends. \nNote: Hostess is pretty cute.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	4xwlPx5dpQpDcQCD2xHrHw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We stood outside wondering if we should walk in for about 5 minutes(the sign said "Please wait to be seated") finally she came out and sat us inside. \n\nTo start off my sister and I shared an order of crispy spring rolls and then shared an order of veggie Panang curry (my fav) with a side of white rice. Everything was tasty.\n\nI even tried the Thai coffee which was amazing! Definitely recommend it if you've never tried it.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	farPCdR79ZVMH7na4liZVQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
EQSTL5Lh5gPsnsdKyv84qg	3	2016-11-22 00:00:00	Who ever labeled Le Thai as a beer garden needs to look up beer garden on Wikipedia. The beer menu was underwhelming, filled with a few overpriced Asian beers, Stella, and PBR. Fresh from a weekend in the mountains, we were ready to imbibe, but we ended up not ordering any drinks.\n\nThey do have a lunch menu that runs every day (except Sunday) from 11-3 for $9.95, but the portions are a little bit smaller. I would also check the receipt carefully as they tried to overcharge us for adding both beef and shrimp to the pad kee mao.\n\nI do like that they offered brown rice without an additional charge, and the food was decent, but nothing I would go out of my way for.\n\nParking: metered around the corner\n\nUPDATE: Response to owner's comment below. That's a lot of math for a simple meal, of which was not explained by the server when we ordered shrimp and beef. No one asked which is a "main" and which is an "add on."	6	4	4	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	DC3dWmmiExUeil94ns4TDg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
erzPQfw3cRRg_5BPMR1iDw	3	2016-03-24 00:00:00	I could not help but be disappointed after how many good reviews I have read about this place. I came here with my friend on a Wednesday at around 11 AM. We figured my two-hour gap between classes would be good to enjoy a well-paced lunch before I got back to the grind. Wrong. \n\nWe were seated rather quickly, and our server brought us two glasses of water almost immediately. He asked us if we already knew what we'd like to order. We did: I ordered the Panang Curry with Beef and a Chicken Satay appetizer, and my friend ordered the Pad Thai Noodles. Five minutes later, we were happily nibbling on our Chicken Satay skewers. No complaints there. What was the issue was what happened afterwards, or well, didn't happen.\n \nKeep in mind, our parking ticket expired at 12:45 PM, and I had to be back on campus by 1:00 PM. As the guests around us came and went, and our main dishes still hadn't appeared, I semi-obsessively checked the time. Our empty appetizer plate stared back at us as if to mock our steadily growing impatience. From when our server took our order sometime around 11:09 AM, we waited until 12:22 PM for our main dishes to come out. We ended up having to rush through our meal, which is a bummer, because the Panang Curry was delicious and well-spiced. I was also looking forward to ordering the Mango with Sticky Rice dessert, but we didn't have time to do so. \n\nI wish I could give this place a higher rating, because the server was quick, friendly and informative, and the food ranged from decent (Chicken Satay) to good (Panang Curry). Unfortunately, it took way too long to come out. In a place where customers pay for parking, I think that is a valid concern. Hopefully this extended wait was a one-time deal.	2	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	lYdIJrjX-QgOhQfsvTQlOg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

EycsRJHzTb8wa8XP79sxKg	1	2016-12-21 00:00:00	I was craving for a Thai Food so I yelped and found this restaurant. When we walked in I was not impressed, it look like more of a "bar" than restaurant. I wanted to walk out but I m starving & I don't want to look for another place. I ordered Pad Thai & Thai Style Fried Rice. After couple of minutes food was served. Pad Thai doesn't look impressive, when I took my first morsel I tasted the fish/squid sauce taste-wow salty!!! I told the waiter that it's salty & he did not even care to ask if I want to change it, like I said I was hungry so to dilute the saltiness I just ordered rice to go with it. \n\nTheir Thai Style Fried Rice is salty as well...\n\nThe service is not that great as well, I did not feel welcome & not even thanked for dinning it. It seems that people who work here does not valued their customers. \n\nI looked at their kitchen they do not have even have a single Asian/Thai chef-so what do you expect? \n\nI suggest that their cook needs to be trained by original Thai Chef if they want to keep their business. I also recommend them to dine in at President Thai in Rosemead CA or even at The Original Thai BBQ in West Covina, LA, or Glendale for them to taste how original  Thai Food is.\n\nPricey & quality of food NO Good!

ezzef7-SsEcE67PO7AKZyA	2	2016-08-21 00:00:00	I've been to Le Thai many times, and the service and food has always been great. It's one of my fav places to go downtown. Today, however, was a different story. I ordered veggie pad Thai with no peanuts...I start eating, and I bite down into something crunchy. Peanuts! You couldn't really tell what they were at first because it was all crunched up and mixed in well with all the other ingredients. They switched it out with no prob. Luckily, I didn't have an allergic reaction. But the the 2nd pad Thai had veggies that seemed not so fresh-almost sour tasting. I ended up just not eating it.\nMy friend ordered fried rice. Which was really good, until she found a long black hair in her food towards the end of the meal. Yuck. They took the dish away, (she was almost done anyway), took it off our bill, and offered to make more food for her to take to go. But by that time, considering both our dishes were messed up, we were just ready to go. \n\nI don't think I will return for awhile :(	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	2CmSHM_t6eJSMhGkZ-x6Rg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
F2kLLo4LUNuV_y1PQX0ofw	3	2013-03-04 00:00:00	Thai food is akin to pizza. Even bad thai food tastes pretty good. Le Thai is a tiny restaurant (with a much larger outdoor patio) right next to Commonwealth. I'm blaming my move to San Francisco for ruining thai restaurants for me. SF thai places have such interesting complex flavors that when you eat at a place like Le Thai you're sorely disappointed. Everything at Le Thai tasted like any other Thai restaurant.\n\nThe group shared:\nPork Jerkey- yummy pork flavor, but the sticky rice was a dried out mess\nBeef app- Poor quality beef with a funky taste to it, also with super dried out sticky rice\nSpring rolls- deep fried, which of course makes them tasty\nPad Thai- fine- tastes like Pad Thai anywhere else\nAwesome Noodle- pretty one note\n3 color curry with shrimp- avoid shrimp here it tastes metallic and fishy\nMinced Chicken with basil- This was tasty\nRoti dessert- weird- egg, nutella and bread- surprisingly not a good combo. \nBrown rice- a gelatinous mess- avoid this and eat the white rice\n\nIf you're worried about spice, two is pretty tame. Le Thai was a big thai food meh...	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	K97i0e7MaxYfvCCwPFMjuw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Love the fact that it's in old Vegas to beat the traffic and crazy touristy prices.\n\nWe ordered: \n\nPork Jerky, one of the best I've ever had, the sauce was nice and tangy, with a little kick. Very authentic style cooking, it's hard to find it this good.\n\nDrunken Shrimp Noodles, nice textured flat noodles and shrimp was pretty good sized, I like the fact that they didn't skimp out on the amount of shrimp. My girlfriend loved this.\n\nAnd the Ga Pow (Mint Leaf/Basil) Chicken ((Spicy Level 3)) -- this was very close to the street cart style food we're accustomed to.\n\nWe're from LA and luckily spoiled with great Thai food. When we're in Vegas, we will be sure to come back here because it is the best in town.\n\nKathy was our server, she was very prompt and courteous with her service. One thing we loved about her was how fast she changed our plates and refilled our ice waters (very rare Asian restaurant trait). \n\nThanks Le Thai!

Called ahead to make a reservation but they didn't have anything early available, but when we arrived in person they found a spot for us pretty quickly. One of our party members knows people that work there so that helped. I was starving too so I'm glad we got in earlier.\n\nLet's see if I remember everything we got: pork jerky, thai chicken wings, pad thai, pad see ew, three color curry, fried rice, drinks. Lots of yummy stuff that was being passed about. My favorite was the pork jerky with the chicken wings coming in second. I don't eat noddles or rice, so nibbling the meat out of those dishes does not really give me a good idea of the dishes, though I remember lots of flavor; I must've been grabbing all the good meat pieces.\n\nI think we could've gone a little spicier for our food but the level 3 spiciness wasn't bad.\n\nAtmosphere was good too. Cute little place.\n\nShout out to the awesome chef Mike for sending us amazing food! Our server (Dean? I think. Tall guy.) was awesome too and very friendly/attentive. We ordered way too much food for our party of 5 and gave the leftovers to the bouncer at Commonwealth. Good night overall. I would like to go back next time I'm in town.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	BEzbr5mmyEx-2DDDf9Px9g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

This place definitely showed me the authentic way to make that soup! Love, love, love! If you're in Downtown Vegas and wants some Thai soup! Must go here and try it!!! \n\nAll the appetizers are good and lunch specials are amazing!!\n\nPS, all the staff are super friendly, that tells you that you will definitely enjoy your meal there for sure!!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	INQJoqBu0t_okDNwlQxQhg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We found it coincidentally via yelp reviews...the power of yelpers!\n\nIt is a gem on Freemont and after walling up and down to soak up old vegas we headed over. Great food and great staff..food was delicious and authentic thai.\n\nI had the awesome flat noodles and beef and my spice level was 2. I also had a lucky buddha beer whichbus very light and a perfect compliment. \n\nHighly recommend, my only suggestion is for wait staff to be transparent about seating. We were told to wait 30 min, called in 10 and when we sat down the entire back area was empty.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	4DqsftnLlMydDjpfF7GIrw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It's not "authentic" Thai by any means (they don't even have Thai servers), but the food itself is good (there is an American spin on the taste which is what you should know going in). If you're not looking for authentic Thai, but a good restaurant, it's a great place to go. I love, love, love their alcoholic Thai Tea and Thai Coffee (which is why I gave it the 4 stars). Seriously amazing - although the coffee is by far my favorite. They're always super packed for lunch - so make sure you get there early!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	hXOHumtKuh0180dT6VV_oQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Working downtown this may be one of my, if not the, favorite place to get lunch from.  I generally go with the beef so I still have yet to try the pork and chicken.  It's nice and small with a nice little courtyard to eat in the back so as you can imagine it gets pretty full at lunch so arrive before noon or prepare to wait.  Heck if you order it, it may take a while.  \n\nThe one thing I'm sad to mention is their spice levels may be too much for me.  The first time I ordered the drunken noodles I went with a 3 thinking that I'd be alright since I'm used it.  Wrong answer, I think I spent more time blowing my nose and drinking water than actually eating, still delicious though.  I usually go with a 2 now so I can still get some spiciness yet still enjoy my meal.  The last time though I went with the awesome noodles at a level of 2 and all of a sudden it left like too much.  So there may be a consistency issue or I've become more of a wuss.  Then again I do notice a lot of chili seeds in there so maybe I'm not a wuss?  Wait, don't answer that! \n\nEither way, the noodles are tasty, the meat succulent, and the various vegetables placed in the different dishes are the perfect compliments for the meal.  I still need to go ahead and try out the curry and other dishes but the drunken and awesome noodles are so good it's hard to convince myself to try anything else!	0	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	xrK1fNVQMFgAxNHhvyQhgg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

They have a small but cute lil dining room overlooking Fremont Street East. I like their outdoor patio in the back (has misters during the summer). \n\nSome of my favorite dishes:\n- Awesome Noodles!

As a popular complaint we reserved a table for 10, hours prior too and yet still wait 20-30 mins. Food was extremely bland & service was complete shit. There is this 4 split check limit for a party 10 in which my party was unaware of.  This made our experience here stressful and complicated. Each time I came thru, it was always difficult to pay. The prices aren't worth the experience or food.

frdPJU9CfhpnJWTE3x9HRw	4	2013-02-07 00:00:00	Great food, not so great service. Stopped in to Le Thai after the CMYE event at Commonwealth with fellow Yelpers. While at Commonwealth I could smell the food from Le Thai and knew I had to go try it.\nWe walked up to front and asked for a table for 8. The girl was on her phone (later realized they use an app on their phones for the business) and went in to check on tables. Came back and told us 45 minutes. We were going to go elsewhere but then asked if we split the group up how long wait would be. She went back in and came back with menus to seat us. She couldn't mention that before hand? We got seated and the two tables we were sat at were really close, didn't understand why they couldn't just put them together.\nAnyway, we ordered with the fairly unfriendly server and waited for our food. The wait time was not bad and the food was delicious. I ordered the short rib fried rice and just a 1 on the spicy scale (0-5 here) and I was glad I did because I think a 2 would have been too much for me. Added a fried egg on top and it was just about perfect. Good amount of meat, perfectly cooked rice and very flavorful.\nWe were just about done eating when the server came and brought the check to our table... a big NO NO for me. This isn't Dennys! A clear sign that they don't care about you is putting down a check early to rush you out the door. When we were ready to pay for the check... she was nowhere to be found. We waited a bit and then Molly gave up and went to go find someone who would take our money.\nPlease get rid of the phone app and use paper or something. It just looks ridiculous and I can't tell if you are on facebook or paying attention to my order.	2	0	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	sL9dYZyNLpzLD3cfTWwyOQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Short rib fried rice was definitely better. Worth trying if you visit this place.\n\nThe bill wasn't too expensive but there are probably better choices in the area. I honestly don't know why the wait for this restaurant can be 45 mins to an hour. Maybe try calling to reserve if you plan togo here.\n\nWe were lucky we were just a party of two so we didn't have to wait.

fUGS3PUtSh-5pf6JB0BSmw	5	2016-03-02 00:00:00	Listen up and listen real good!  This past unprofitable trek to Clark County, I ventured over to a little joint they call The Lotus of Siam on my final day in town.\n\nI was in between hotel rooms and took the tram to the SLS, where I proceeded to walk 10 long blocks on E Sahara with $2800 in Ben Franklins in my Fossil-brand wallet.  Not one of the smarter things I've done in this city of Gold, but it's exercise and I've heard so many great things about this joint that I refused to leave town without giving it a shot.\n\nLet's just say that I'm sure I'll give this petty little business another go around, but it wasn't anything special and it most certainly isn't any Le Thai.\n\nI love this place (Le Thai) and will eat here at least three times when I do my usual two night stay downtown on my three annual trips.  I've never had a bad experience, the staff is great and the food is fantastic.\n\nI'll even come in all by my lonesome where the locals can stare at the guy with no friends and who likes to drink alone like rock icon George Thorogood.  I'm not embarrassed or ashamed.  I mind my own business and scarf down anything from the soups, papaya salads, thai wings, curries, fried rice, and (most importantly) the lemongrass daiquiri.\n\nNOTHING epitomizes masculinity than one of those lemongrass daiquiri's.  They make the lemongrass syrup in house and I deposit those bad boys in my innards, if you know what I'm sayin'.\n\nIf Yelp allows me to post a picture of the papaya salad and daiquiri I took, would you possibly laugh at a 6'4", sharp dressed outsider scarfin' that down all the way in the back of the joint by his lonesome?  Or how about at the bar for all of the patrons to see?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe prices are great (they have an amazing lunch special for $10 that can't be beat....not even a Ebola Burrito Bowl over at the Chipotle can compare).\n\nThe Lotus of Siam doesn't compare, either.  \n\nGo to Le Thai.\n\nGood bye.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	bQJlF0mnc4yxpIHmE0zUfA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Now, to the food.\n\nI Received a bowl of well-seasoned and slightly spicy peanuts for a comp appetizer at the bar. Tasty!\n\nSpring rolls were cooked well, not too greasy, but not much flavor either. Sauce could have had more punch as well.\n\nDrunken Noodles were a disappointment, unfortunately. This is my test dish for all Thai restaurants because it says a lot about seasoning, technique, preparation, and overall flavor. I had them with Pork (first time), on recommendation from my waiter. The meat was too plentiful and ground, so it was overpowering, the noodles too few, so the dish had no balance, there was no egg at all (why?) and the basil was flat and not flavorful at all. I asked for medium spicy and I couldn't taste the hot at all.\n\nSo, overall a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't be a regular.

Generally I would go with the signature dish but I wasn't feeling fried rice so I went with the classic Pad Thai.  It's served in a large bowl and from the visual of its contents, I knew these guys were the real deal.  I can taste the preserved radish, dried shrimp and fish sauce.  It's got a pungent taste which for Asian this is a good thing.

Totally my fault for not going with what I originally wanted.  Upon noticing my less than enthusiastic mood over my dish, they immediately asked if I would like a round noodle dish or even our money back.  We declined of course because it was no fault of theirs, but I thought them going the extra mile was pretty awesome.

My parents had been taking us out to eat pretty much all week so I thought it would be a great to take them out of their comfort zone and take them to dinner.  I also checked Yelp and read some of the positive reviews so I knew we were in for some good eating!\n\nWhen we arrived, the hostess asked if we had reservations...oops...she took down my name and said it would be about an hour.  What we didn't know was that there was a patio in the back so the dining room may look small at first glance.  We only waited about 30 minutes and luckily sat inside cause it's really cold in Vegas during the holidays.\n\nWe ordered the staples: panang curry with chicken, pad thai with chicken...\n\nMom: Don't you want to try something other than chicken?\n\n...pad kee mow with tofu, and short rib fried rice (something we've never seen)  We also ordered spring rolls to start which were pretty standard and served with a sweet chili pepper sauce.  Each dish was delicious!  But it was the fried rice that really stood out!  Now we had wished we tried this place earlier!  However, as with each trip, it's great to end a trip with an amazing meal.  I tried coconut water for the first time and it was pretty good.  \n\nThe place was full so it did take a little while for our food to arrive.  I credit that to the two tables that sat ahead of us and a string of take-out orders.  But we weren't in a hurry...and family meals are meant to be enjoyed.  It's a very cool and hip restaurant and everyone was very friendly.  We were also able to see the cooks in the kitchen through a large window.  My parents wondered how old the building was since it is located on east Fremont Street.  It can feel a little sketchy at first, but it's pretty safe since the El Cortez is kitty corner to it.\n\nI will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.	3	2	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	rAAT39HF4khu-OdxBSr0jg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Our server was friendly and the overall experience was just what we needed after far too many drinks during the day. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered two different vegetarian meals and I was thoroughly impressed! We thought we were just stopping at some random place for some greasy dinner and turns out we hit he jackpot. Ha.. haha.. hahaha. It was funny, ok?

While I enjoyed it for what it was, I'm not sure I'd order it again. But fear not as there's plenty of other  options. I just took a chance on the wild card. \n\nI went with your standard Pad Thai, but I saw some familiar Thai favorites sprinkled into the mix. The Pad Thai was exactly what you'd expect, and was done very well. \n\nMy companion ordered the Thom Yum soup and was gracious enough to let me try it. They do not mess around with the heat my friends. That thing was so spicy. But so tasty. The broth was excellent and all the veggies in it seemed fresh and perfectly cooked. \n\nThey also have a cute little outdoor section where you can order a drink at the window and chill on the sidewalk to watch the people go by.

It is one of my favorite types of food and I have been really disappointed with most places I have tried. When I finally got around to going downtown for Le Thai, I was not disappointed. I gauge all my Thai food on the way they prepare their Pad Kee Mao and this place did such a good job, I don't get anything else!\n\nThe restaurant is really nice to eat at and the service is always really good. Now that I live downtown, we get it for take out and are always full and happy!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	9u9fQhq0hynxjLQgZGpmSA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
gF7lPuPpIAdYs6vGVFiZpQ	3	2015-03-31 00:00:00	This place used to be phenomenal, but I think the increased business from the downtown project got to their heads. Yes, the food was good, some of the best I've had in Vegas, but the server only checked in once. We were told they ran out of silverware and the dishes, so we had to use what we had, no fresh plates. This place is busy every night, how do they run out of dishes? The drinks also took a ridiculously long time, about 20 minutes a drink. This place has been a tradition when hitting up downtown for a long time, but I think it's time to look at other places.\n\nUpdate:\n\nGave it another shot last week and everything was better, service seemed improved and they actually had dishes!	2	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	l0rZgNFwOzoq8pUkaIWvYg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I will have to change other reviews because of the amazing food I experienced here. \n\nService was good, staff is friendly and food comes out quickly. I thought the menu had a lot of options for vegans as well as carnivores. \n\nMy favorite things here are the drunken noodle and chicken satay. Both delicious, drunken noodles with spices and soy sauce, melt in your mouth chicken cut up really small, peanut sauce tastes homemade as well. Curry is also nicely done. It comes with rice and in three different flavors with your choice of meat. I have been here multiple times and never experienced bad service or bad food. \n\nI would recommend this more for locals or people looking for a local experience in Vegas. No tourists here.	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	BIcfTJw4-76b9NuZUgpKIA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Everything was really tasty. We were there for lunch, and they had a bunch of lunch specials, that included drinks, etc. We stayed on that menu.\n\nThe waitress was fast and efficient, when we ordered the stock questions was on a scale to 1-5, how spicy? We all said 3, but next time I would say 4 absolutely! It needed a bit more heat!\n\nThey do get busy, and are really small, so plan on the possibility of waiting a bit. The hostess told us 20 minutes, but it was about 5. Love that!\n\nI had the Chicken Basil saute, it was good but tasted the other dishes on the table and their dishes were better! The red curry was AMAZING!! And as cliche as it is, the Pad Thai was really great as well!!!\n\nIf you are hungry and in the area - go check it out!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	y5rqDe6uO06WKZ26-Pla8g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The food was delicious, packed with flavor, seasoning was spot on however my reason for a 3* is : we found the portions *very* small. Thai is my favorite cuisine and I eat in Thai places at least few times a week and can easily say that the food was simply not enough to be a meal in itself here (which is hardly the case in most other Thai places). \n\nIf the portion was right, I would have given a 5* rating to the place.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	KgwPpYXY2UBdwx8E4bsdxA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

GMuDX9f-AEAMQaDl7WOfIg	1	2015-05-24 00:00:00	We arrived at there were a couple of guys behind us in line to be seated. We waited about 5-10 minutes to be seated. We arrive at our seats and maybe another 5-10 minutes pass by and the guys behinds us are seated right next to us. \n\nWe ordered before they did and even ordered an appetizer and  they received their food 1st. No big deal. But then I noticed we are being ignored and the people behind us have the waiter coming by every couple of minutes. Like WTF! So I call over the waiter and ask her about our order, she says it will be right out and trys to walk off...I had to raise my voice slightly so she could stay and I brought up that we were here 1st and they got their food already. BOTH OF THEM.  and we havent even got our appetizer...she said "oh yea, they forgot your ticket" I wanted to get up and leave at this point. So they bring ALL the food our together and I ordered soup. The soup was clearly not cooked...it litterly tasted like water with flavoring....The strangest taste ever just horrible....And on top of that they brought it in a HUGE bowl with a HUGE spoon...it was obviouse this was a bowl where you take from and pour into a smaller bowl (which they forgot) I looked around and saw someone else who had ordered soup who had the same huge bowl and additional smaller bowls to pour into. I call the waiter over and say, I think this bowl and spoon is a little big for me to eat it directly....and she VERY RUDELY says, Well all you have to do is ask for more bowls...is that what you want? So I rudely responded YES thats exactly what I want....and she walked away...didnt say anything, just walked away. So the bowl comes out and I asked for lemons to try to see if I can make the soup edible....but no luck. So I didn't eat the soup, I took maybe 5 bites from the entire thing...and this thing was BIG. So I decided I was going elsewhere to eat and we ask for the check. The waiter brings us the check and says "I added a 10% discount" for the trouble im guessing. And I said, I didn't like the soup and didn't eat it could you take it off the bill because im going to eat elsewhere. She said, "whats wrong with it?" After all this history we  had, shes going to ask me whats wrong with it. I lost it! \n\nI basically told her it was bland and not cooked. She said let me talk to my manager...I said please do and if not I would like to speak with him because this whole night is ridiculous. She came back and took the soup off and we left...Hungry. \n\nThe atmosphere is nice...I like it	3	2	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	0TbJKYuOFmZ9JGfqaH4OMQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Bartender was very friendly and made us some great drinks. The green vegetable curry was SO flavorful (and I've probably eaten curry a thousand times) and I discovered my favorite new tea (Harney and Sons Jasmine). The BF had edamame and the red curry and loved those also.

go87Ganqhv7VMgyxNmz_WA	5	2014-11-03 00:00:00	A friend suggested we go to Le Thai last night... He said it was near Fremont Street and is a true locals favorite.  There was approximately an 80 minute wait to be seated.  We put our name on the list and was told they would send a text message when our table was ready. I am sooooo glad we opted to wait instead of bailing and going somewhere else. I had the Short Rib Fried Rice and it was amazingly good. I ordered it #2 hot and probably should have ordered a #3 (was very flavorful just not quite hot enough - my fault).  I've honestly been craving a second helping all day today. My buddy ordered Waterfall Beef Noodles which was equally as delicious. We didn't have drinks, only water last night.  Our total bill came out to $26!!  You won't find that on the strip. My advice: if you live in vegas or visiting sometime soon, do not pass go and do not collect $200!  Proceed directly to Le Thai!!!!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	fMkEU4uJLYcquC-c-XdQjA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Sat at the bar because they were holding several tables for reservations, but they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more. It's very small. It feels like a place you would actually go to in Thailand, but operated by downtown hipsters. A majority of the seating is outdoors. I ordered the spiked Thai tea and my husband got the lady boy. Both drinks weren't particularly tasty. We ordered the tom kha, don't be fooled by the low numbers! My husband wasn't having a hard time with level 2. My favorite dish was the awesome noodles.

But, then a wall of mist hit me like a shower of rain pedals. Not an inch of the patio wasn't covered with the cool water. Once I cooled down my appetite set in. The menu offering pad see ew, pad thai, and my favorite - the awesome noodles was one tasty looking dish after another. The awesome noodles are...well...awesome! Essentially, it's delicious noodles soaked in a spicy, soy based sauce, but instead of smaller egg noodles in Pad Thai, they are fatter and wider, oh - did I mention, they are delicious? The appetizers were equally as good as the awesome noodles. LIke the chicken wings: spicy with a crispy skin and accompanied with a spicy sauce of which I have never had the pleasure of tasting. Now - Out of all the things in Vegas, I find myself wanting to return Sin City for the Awesome Noodles.	1	1	4	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	gvOuN8PAUJHOfbO03dOgUA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Order a #1 & add your own chili. You have been warned. \n\nI love this place so much, and really wish it was in LA. The fried rice dishes and Tom Yum are just amazing. Great cocktails too.

Sometimes there is an azzload of tofu, other times it's an azzload of noodles. Sometimes when you order a spice level one it's not spicy at all, next time you order up a few levels and it's too spicy to eat.\n\nWhy do we come back? We are hungry and are too lazy to drive somewhere. It's easy to walk a few blocks when you are starving vs. driving somewhere. We have never had a bad experience nor a horrible meal.\n\nMy fav dishes are the vegan curry, the garlic rice and the Pad Kee Mao. Hubby always gets the Awesome Flat noodles. Last time he actually said when we left "those noodles were not that awesome". Ok!\n\nFor me to describe each dish would be ridic because it's just not that fabulous. Garlic rice is a joke compared to Komol blah blah.\n\nThe service is always prompt and very nice. All servers smile and in a place with super fast turnover, they seem to enjoy their jobs. \n\nI haven't looked at the prices to compare them to other places. A lot of people say it's overpriced but that doesn't surprise me because it's a Downtown hotspot.\n\nI'm sure we will continue to go back...when we are starving and want a level zero.

I ordered level 3 out of five, being Mexican and used to spicy food I thought 3 would be perfect but when I got my tom yum soup It was so spicy I could hardly enjoy it. Their spice level chart is waay of, it should be 1to 3 instead of 1 to 5 my friend ordered a 4 for his meal and was as hot as mine, so here's a more accurate spiciness chart.....\n1= medium\n2= hot\n3to5= fire!\nAnd although I did not enjoy my meal this time due to my taste buds being temporarily injured and not being able to really taste anything else past the chili, the fun atmosphere, the great service from my waiter/waitress, the awesome drinks, and the need to try other items on the menu guarantees a certain Le Return.\n\nFor now, Le Thai gets 3 stars which is actually 5 if you go by their chart.	3	5	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	EG6qatWgJ2WTJnzBCCH_Dg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

If you're in Vegas and you're sick of stuffing your face with buffet or expensive strip food, definitely head downtown and give this place a try.\n\nIt's pretty small so I would recommend making a reservation if you have a large party, otherwise you'll be waiting over an hour to be seated. \n\nPro tip: try the Lucky Buddha beer, it's delicious and the bottle is adorable.

Even on a Monday night I ended up sitting at the bar to eat because the tables were full and didn't want to wait for a table. I ordered a Thai tea, Thai style wings, and short rib fried rice, which was enough for two. I loved everything I ordered but probably would order a spice level 3 instead of 4. The spiciness overwhelmed the flavors so a 3 would have been better. The wings were perfectly crispy and the sauce paired nicely with it. The staff was super friendly and welcoming. Would definitely come here again when I'm in town.	1	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	cvXSmTFs5e_ntsKfhtY71g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
h7e5YaPGDXytCkmaPhh4LA	4	2012-01-10 00:00:00	A great addition to downtown and late night munchies.\n\n . I am not able to eat meat currently and they were able to accommodate that. I ended up with the awesome noodles with tofu and no fish sauce. It was sweet, garlicky and spicy. I think it probably is better with the fish sauce in it to give it more balance to the sweet. Definitely a fan of the noodles as it was a hybrid of flavors I like in other noodle dishes. I came with a group of Yelper girls and everything we ordered looked and smelled great. I have had the three color curry in the Dans previous restaurant and it's probably just as great here. \n\nThe place is small, but there is also a back patio (with heat lamps). It was a perfect night so we sat out there comfortably.\n\nIf you're in the Fremont area and need a bite to eat to sop up the drinks, this is pretty good. I'm going to come back to sample more after bar hopping.	1	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I try to walk in to every restaurant with a completely open mind. Because more often than not, especially when using Yelp, I find myself pleasantly surprised. Also I think that our expectations can completely control our ultimate experience in every aspect of our lives, so going light on expectations is a sure fire way to enjoy life more. \n\nThat said, I am a little spoiled, coming from Portland Oregon, with our insanely good Thai food. And Le Thai did not disappoint. I was shepherded here by Nate M, the local Vegas CM, and thoroughly enjoyed my dinner. I sampled a few dishes and was impressed by all of them. They don't hold back on the spice level, the service is solid, the venue is cozy and vibrant, and the gin n' tonics are plenty strong. The menu does have a few interesting dishes I don't often see at your run-of-the-mill joints. And to top it all off, there's a Yelp check-in offer for a free hug. \n\nI saved my hug for the next visit.	12	9	8	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Pf7FI0OukC_CEcCz0ZxoUw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

He recommended this amazing Cucumber mint vodka martini that was super refreshing and delicious!! We checked into our Yelp profiles and received a free Thai tea!! After the Martini I ordered a tamarind margarita . Being Mexican I love my tamarind. We finally ordered our food and we ordered the Vegan Curry at level 3 and a Tom Kha with tofu at a level 5 ... My god !! Our food was ridiculously delicious !! We spent 23 days in Thailand in December and I must say that the authenticity of le Thai is pretty accurate ! We took some left overs home and of course we scarfed them down that night! What I really appreciated about le thai other than the delicious food was the personable , caring and attentive staff!! Definitely bringing  my family here next time they come visit me!!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ZjKNo_fx42SxD7eijUlz5Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
HAiFc9Cigis5qhiD0_TIuQ	4	2014-07-19 00:00:00	My sister and I were staying at the Golden Nugget (lucky us) and were looking for a local restaurant for dinner. To our surprise, we found Le Thai tucked away in the middle of Fremont St. We walked in and were seated right away, even though the tiny place was packed. We sat at a counter in the patio section behind the restaurant. It was a cool night, but with heating lamps and a warm bowl of deliciousness, it was quite comfortable.\n\nWe each ordered a Thai iced tea and a bowl of noodles. The iced tea was comparable to any Thai iced tea I've ever had, nothing amazing, but good. I ordered the awesome noodles with chicken (mostly because of the name) and was very pleased. It was flavorful and filling. My sister got the pad thai which was also very good. We ended up sharing our dishes since they were both so good. Overall, I think I liked the pad thai best, but I'm always a sucker for pad thai anyway.\n\nThe pricing is a little high for the portions, but not bad. The meal was much better than any of the cheaper options on Fremont Street. And it's Vegas anyway. Earlier in the day we paid twenty bucks for a drink, so fifteen bucks for a bowl of noodles really isn't  bad. The service was OK, but was a little bit slow. It took a while for our orders to be taken and to get our drinks. \n\nOverall, this is a nice spot. I'd highly recommend it to anyone stuck in Old Vegas, looking for some quality food.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	wdrYjGRKHHS_hoORMtrBFw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The place is small, and seating is really limited, it is typically an hour to two hour wait for a table...or just go to the window outside and order.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	PKAZIzOKCEk8q5uTX5KqCQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
HB4Hq61TAAGhbpQhYo9FZQ	2	2013-12-01 00:00:00	I had read all the reviews about this place and was excited to go there for my 5 year wedding anniversary.  I had read here on Yelp that Fridays are a busy night and to expect a wait for a table. No problem... we were Downtown and had other things to entertain ourselves before eating.  I had also seen on Yelp that on Friday they close at 3am.  So I was highly disappointed when we got there at 1:40am that we were the last order.  Looking at the menu I noticed that there was a great difference in price ($11-15) from the pictures of the menu posted here on Yelp. At that moment, our waitress came by to remind us again that it was last call and to order our food NOW!  Feeling rushed, we ordered and appetizer and 2 entrees to-go and waited.  During our wait... there was at least another 15-20 people looking to eat and were told to go to FUKU burger instead.\n\nWhen we got home.... the side of rice that they had for our entrees was old but the actual food was good.  In my opinion... I've been to other Thai places that gave both good food and service.	1	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	eNnrTuaEulTYgAuerw7czA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
HbArGEYHSRocpl5epsjscA	4	2014-11-02 00:00:00	Perfect location, good food and awesome service is what makes Le Thai absolutely delightful. I have liked everything I ever tried here but Chicken fried rice and yellow curry are my favorite.Their spice level does vary at times, like a 3 would be spicy for me at times and sometimes even a 4 wouldn't be that spicy.That is not much of a problem though.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ycu8VwXWsOjcciu3fMtV9A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
HBIQCLroxxtM9MYLWxWBjA	3	2016-02-29 00:00:00	After finding out Lotus of Siam did not open until dinner time on a Saturday morning, my friends and I came to Le Thai because of the high reviews and our craving for Thai food after a long night of clubbing. It is located near the arts district in Down Town Las Vegas and there was already a 30-45 minute wait at noon. The restaurant is small and there is only street parking, which was $2/hr. \n\nAlthough the employees were very friendly and accommodating, I have to give this place a 3/5 stars because I have definitely have had cheaper and better Thai food. It was less authentic and more Americanized. The restaurant had a cute hipster vibe to it with an outside back patio, but all in all the place felt like a tourist destination.\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\n- 3 Color Curry: Option of Chicken/Beef/Pork/Tofu/Shrimp ($12/$14): It's a blend of red, yellow, and green curry with vegetables and a side of brown or white rice. Good, but I would recommend the lunch portion.\n- Pad See Ewe (Noodle): Option of Chicken/Beef/Pork/Tofu ($13). This was probably the only dish I would be able to finish by itself out of everything we ordered. Recommend.\n- Pad Thai (Noodle): Option of Chicken/Beef/Pork/Tofu ($13). Very dry and bland compared to the Pad See Ewe. Even after we added more sauce.\n- Tom Yum: Option of either Chicken, Tofu, or Shrimp ($10). It's a Thai style hot & sour soup with mushroom, tomato, lemon grass and lemon juice, topped with green onions and cilantro. I would recommend the tofu after trying both the tofu and chicken soup. This soup is perfect to cleanse your palette if you're getting tired of whatever entree you ordered.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	soTFSSm05oFaoXG9IGHrig	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
hbYBttn-HL7ePxt7mOf38g	3	2017-01-01 00:00:00	This place is downtown so it's pretty small and gets packed fairly quickly so if they take reservations I would make one.\n\nOverall I like this place but it's not my favorite compared to other Thai places. I think they are a bit overpriced, especially for their lunch menu. \n\nI've only 2-3 of the menu items and they were all good, not amazing but still good.	0	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	-PXJEs_9T0lRKpssxf3otg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Our waitress was very friendly and we ordered tom kha soup, red curry, green curry, and pad pak. The Tom Kha was the star of the show. I would order it for my dinner next time because it was so good but we shared it between 4 people this time. The main dishes were good as well and they definitely put their own unique spin on them. The prices are very fair and reasonable especially since it's a bit off the strip. Give it a shot, I'm sure you won't regret it!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ITAg1q546JUIFDz8L9M8MA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

They have these awesome musters outside too, so even in 105 degree heat we were comfortable. Watch out on their heat scale.

HfOZPwcNWe082_8OOUl2Mw	2	2014-11-08 00:00:00	So according to Yelp two star rating translates to "Meh. I've experienced better." \n\n  Le Thai has a really cool layout. There's indoor and outdoor, but remember you're on Fremont so if you sit outside it is going to be loud. I sat in their outdoor seating, call it what you will but if there's not an actual roof up over my head then i'm outside. On that note i think they are next to an open mic night club where it gets ridiculously loud. What did i hear exactly? Well i'll tell you this, i did not know whether to stay in my seat and wait for my food, or forget the food and start lurking on girls that look like they're from a Nikki Minaj video.\n\n Now for the food and service. The server was great but the order took some time to get to our table. Water is the most basic to be served, in fact that was our first order. Somehow the server decided to bring that last... Some of our food was cold and had a different after taste from other variations of Thai food I've had. It's not bad I just didn't like it. \n\nFinal words\n\n  I do not regret coming here, it would take a lot to make me regret something. My friend has been wanting to take me here and we still managed to enjoy our time. This restaurant has way more potential and I hope they do make some changes. If not then there are always other places that serve Thai food late at night and have more of a music selection other than Nikki Minaj-esque music.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Ks08kxLXL2TyoliPIF7hZA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

hJhJxlLggfrVhMIV2LzNdw	4	2013-04-11 00:00:00	I was staying at the near-by Golden Nugget and was looking for a Thai place downtown (my old favourite had now closed) so I found this place through the high ratings of fellow yelpers. I was not disappointed. The place is small inside but has an outside area in the back. I had one of the lunch special the Chicken basil which was quite good and spicy as I asked. The presentation was a bit unusual, the rice was at the bottom of the bowl, covered by a layer of chicken and topped with an "over easy" egg with the yoke liquid so it did flow on the other ingredients below. Unusual but good. Under $10 with tips and including a drink so quite a good deal.	3	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	seR0RklSV0nbfXv31LtSxg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

hNQrHbQc6C9dnq5PupGKMQ	1	2016-09-10 00:00:00	We've intended to go to LeThai several times as we've heard good things about their food.  However, given the lack of online reservation links on Yelp or on their site, we've made other choices as we were interested in pre-concert dining before a Smith Center event.  \n\nHopefully the owners will wake up some day, update their 2015 web site and also establish online reservation capability.  For potential customers who need a dependable departure time due to timed-events following dinner, having to remember to call back later in the day once Le Thai is open is problematic in two ways: 1) whether a local (like me) is off doing errands or a visitor is off to visit many other daytime activities in Southern Nevada, forgetting to call may well happen, and, 2) For the desired dining time there might not be any tables available.  If one learns that later in the day, then it necessitates stopping everything to start looking for reservations late in the day.\n\nObviously Le Thai is not interested in attracting pre-concert diners, which if marketed to successfully, can expand dinner hour revenue.  If the owners ever wake up to that fact, they'll need to make some type of online reservation system available.  Good luck!	0	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	h-1bF73q_YtAubd4v8-VWA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Even on hot Vegas nights, the misters keep the atmosphere tropical and cool.\n\nNow about the food. Awesome noodles are appropriately named. Enough said. The Three Color Curry is delicious and they do make it spicy so bear that in mind. If you have a sweet tooth, the Roti (Thai pancake) is a flaky, egg pastry filled with Nutella and drizzled with condensed milk.

LE THAI WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN ALL MY LIFE!!! \nHusband and I always go to commonwealth and we always say we are going to try this place because the smell is intoxicating when you are on the roof. \n\nWell, we finally got around to trying it out. The wait was 45 mins, but they have a service that texts you when your table is ready and you can see how many parties are infront of you, VERY COOL. We didn't want to stuff our selves on our first time there since we were going out after. We shared the beef appitizer with the waterfall sauce. SHUT YOUR DIRTY MOUTH LE THAI!!!! How dare you make something so tasty. Every time we go there now we always order extra of this yumminess. For our entree we shared the awesome noodles. They are exactly that, AWESOME. \n\nThe next time we went I got the awesome noodles again because they were so good the flavors are perfectly balanced with the flavors and textures. Husband got the short rib fried rice, I had a bite or 5, haha, and had to stop myself from taking over his meal. \n\nThe service is always great, they seem to remember us at this point now, which is always a great feeling. We expect nothing fast when we go because you can't rush greatness!!! The service is the same when it's just the 2 of us and when it has been 8 of us. \n\nOH and the price is pretty legit. When it is just the husband and I we spend under $20 when we share and under $30 when we don't.	2	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	UJ4uCYEppIIo9IRGMx5E1A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Came here on a repeat visit, sat at the bar, ordered food and waited, and waited, and oh waited. Asked the bartender how much longer for our food, mind you that all around us got their food. A man came in sat next to us for a take out order and got it and left, while we are sitting and still waiting for our order. Bartender comes up and says "oh the wifi wasn't working so the order didn't go through" really sir? U couldnt check in the back to see how our order is coming along about a half hour ago? The food can be amazing in a restaurant but bad service definitely can ruin a persons experience and even make u have a dislike for the food itself. I'm very understanding if u explain the situation.

We were told an hour wait and contemplated ordering from the take out window and just eating outside but a couple spots opened up at the bar. Ordered the red chicken curry and pad Thai. Both were amazing! Even with spiciness level 2 they had a fair amount of heat.

(geek alert) They have booze. $3 PBR's, Mekong whiskey, some lady mentioned a cocktail called the Lady Boy which I'll have to now try.... in fact I think I'm going to go there right now!\n\nSuggestions: I would like to see some deserts, and a more varied appetizer menu, and occasionally Ive gone and they had dance music playing weird and I didn't like it... but none of those things are going to keep me from going at least once a week.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	oUE-E24uKX9WluyW145ndg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The menu is very limited and has no Papaya Salad. The Pad See Ew was mushy and did not have that signature Thai flavor. The soup was ok the best of the three, but each dish tasted the same. Maybe they ran out of ingredients because it just did not taste like real Thai food. I would not eat here again and that's too bad because I work downtown and love Thai. The other reviews for Le Thai seem fake to me! Komal is still the place to go and actually every other Thai I have tried in town is better.  Oh and the service was lacking. Not a good first impression.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ryZYa2v5Df0CTjUlqW-cnA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I1Wj7ZyPz3Wa4pOhv56gew	5	2012-05-02 00:00:00	Love this restaurant. It is located off Fremont Street right nextdoor to Insert Coin(s) and less than a 5 minute walk to the Fremont Experience.\n\nThey seem to have went with a more authentic Thai flavor versus most of the Americanized restaurants in the valley. AKA, their meals have the option for more spice and kick. \n\nThai Jerky, Red Curry, CHICKEN SATAY!! Of course the Pad Thai here is awesome as well regardless during lunch or dinner. Their noodles are small and stringier so they may taste different from regular Thai restaurants.\n\nBut of all things, I recommend everyone to try out the "Waterfall Sauce". It is spicy so I recommend not having too much of it if you cannot handle spices. Very unique!	2	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	RSLTG7N0wYJhRTW5CGEm5Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It was great to choose your spice level too.\n\nService was excellent and professional. We ordered an iced Thai tea, and because we didn't really like it, our server took it off the check without us even asking. Overall, great experience.

I9wSY1NWn19OEdqMcr727g	4	2017-02-19 00:00:00	I honestly I don't know why everyone is so hyped about this place. \nSuper friendly service I must say, the girl who took our order was super friendly. \nWe ordered the short ribs fried rice which was delicious. \nSo we ordered deep fried Cornish hen (what they had special at the time) mind you this is our Valentine's day dinner. The chicken or hen was okay. Something was off but it just didn't taste right, may be an old chicken. It was kinda sour. Their ginger sauce was really good though, the fish sauce kinda hide the sourness of the chicken lol \nAlso ordered pork jerky which was amazing. It comes with sticky rice and the water fall sauce. Best part of the dinner I would say. \nOk so as we were ordering I had no idea that the chicken comes with rice AND jerky comes with rice. I was telling her that I wanted steamed veggies because she offered that instead but I didn't know that it comes with rice so I said ok we'll take the sticky rice I guess. \nWe ordered 3 dishes and ALL have rice in it so I don't know why she didn't tell me about it because I would have ordered the steamed veggies instead. \nI ordered a drink and of course she got the wrong drink. She was really friendly but there was a lot of miscommunication that night lol \nIf I had to judge the food in general, it was fine. Nothing special to be crazy over lol. \nThat's just me though. Hope that helped.  \nIt's probably me having the worst luck. As always.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ms-e5rZ5wq3odv9sWp97fw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
iA3CLbZbE0ceziVsnZxxMQ	4	2017-05-31 00:00:00	I went to Le Thai on Fremont Street with two other people. We were trying to find a Thai place that used ingredients representative of Thai cuisine and heard about this place. The waiting wasn't that long. We were seated within 10 minutes. Once we received our food, customer service could have been more prompt. Someone didn't come to our table right away when we raised our hand even though some of the workers were standing around socializing. Even after we told someone about a plate that needed to be replaced because ice water had been spilled on it, it still took a few minutes to replace it. I would have expected a little more checking up on tables and being prompt. However, we enjoyed the food we ordered. My favorite was the Pad Thai!\n\nWe ordered Pad Thai with chicken, Red Curry with beef, spring rolls, and mango sticky rice for 3 people. The spice appears to be a little higher here because we ordered a 1 spice level for both the Pad Thai and Red Curry and it still had a little heat. It was, however, cooked well and we enjoyed it. \n\nThe Red Curry was creamy with green peppers and carrots. The bamboo shoots added a nice texture to the curry and the heat from the chilies was refreshing because it doesn't burn your throat. There was a good amount of the red curry broth that comes in the portion. The beef was tender.\n\nThe spring rolls had a nice crispness to the outside. I especially loved the red sauce that comes with the spring rolls. The mixture of sweet with a little spice from the chilies helped the spring rolls stand out from other ones I've had from other Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. \n\nThe Pad Thai was really good here. The dish has an appealing color palette. The rice noodles were cooked well. It wasn't too greasy or mushy. The bean sprouts added a nice texture to the dish. The green onion tasted fresh and enhanced the flavor along with the carrots and cilantro.  The flavor savored in your mouth and there appeared to be a lot of fresh ingredients in this dish that smelled really good. The ingredients complemented and balanced each other well. This was probably my favorite dish of the ones I ate.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	goCV8d2fjNOQpKrMQ5GS2g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I love Thai food and go all over DC searching for new places, and this is one of the best I've had!\n\nPad thai is amazing, a little different that what I've had before (usually heavy on the peanut sauce) but this one was a little lighter and delicious. My friend said the panang curry was pretty spicy compared to usual for her but she still loved it. The fried rice was also amazing. \n\nYou HAVE to get the mango sticky rice. Hands down best I've ever had. Ever. \n\nWill for sure be back the next time I'm in vegas!	1	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	SrDmD3UP8QBsJnjK4iOLZg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
IC8n3JFw129pN1pNCU83fw	2	2014-05-15 00:00:00	This restaurant is not bad and it's definitely great for the Fremont area, but Pin Kaow Thai is better.  The pad see ew was way too sweet, drinks over priced, and the service not so great.  I came for a birthday party and they permitted us to make a reservation because there was six of us, but we still didn't get seated until over an hour after our reservation time.  Then they seated us at a counter that faced a wall so our party couldn't communicate with each other. We could only hear the person seated next to us.  Who seats a birthday party like that?	0	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	UcmjgcFV2wTwoNAQTSfffw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I have yet to find a better place than Weera, and for some reason I keep WANTING to think this place is better but it's not. Why? Because out of the 8 times I have been here every single time my food is different...different portion size, food has flavor or no flavor,spice level (even though I always do a 2), cleanliness factor, either horrible or great service, and my spiked thai tea is always either WAY to strong (not that that is a bad thing) or weak as s&%t! There is NO consistency here. Oh, and watch out on the spice level. I'm half korean and a 2 is a challenge! My son ordered a 5 once and couldn't even eat it! Again, I feel like there is never consistency. Oh and try to avoid sitting on the back lanai near the back if the trash has not been taking out...twice I have sat back there and the smell of dumpster is not what you want while having dinner. I'm not sure there will be a 9th visit to Le Thai.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	otgJn5Z4Ka7xTO2Pn8QKKQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
ICvii2V79BKoZAhNwpgsfg	4	2012-04-26 00:00:00	The business can be a little slow here especially if you go during lunch hour.  They usually only have 2 waiters, but they use quick phone technology to put through orders. \n\nThe food is great!  I'm not huge into Thai food, but they can make anyone love it.  The spice level can be pretty intense.  I am a fiend for spicy food, but I opt for a 3 out of 5 and depending on the peppers that day, even a 3 can be too extreme.  \n\nThey have a fantastic selection of high quality teas.  The tea leaves look insane when you see them.\n\nThis is a great place to bring your friends where you can sit inside or outside.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	bCPzc9bIVHbCJsuwf9Vvuw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

This place attracts a younger crowd (age 21-40) but that's me! During pleasant weather, sit outside in the back patio. The Tom Ka Kai here is the most delicious I have ever tasted. Very hearty coconut soup with lots of mushrooms. I also enjoy the twist the make with their Tofu Pad Thai. Great presentation and large portion - so plan to share or take some home.

And the food weren't that good.

And if you go in the evening? Enjoy the spicy peanuts. Seriously delicious and flavorful!!\n\nService\nEveryone here from host to the waiters and waitresses, bar staff and manager are all super friendly and professional. They are usually slammed in the evening but the service remains amazing none the less. I am surprised they keep smiles on their faces despite the constant rush of patrons in and out, We always give a generous tip to reflect their excellent service!\n\nWait Time\nBe prepared to wait if you come later in the evening. You can download the "no wait" app to add yourself to the list on a busy evening. \n\nLocation\nFremont is a bustling and hip area of vegas - just far enough from the Fremont experience to avoid the madness but close enough to benefit from the busy ambience.

Le Thai is legit, and always a solid go to for lunch or dinner. The food is tasty, short rib fried rice, awesome noodles, and even their lunch time curry specials are all simply delicious. And let me tell you about the service... these guys/gals are run ragged because of the amount of people that run through this place each night and they always have smiles on their faces. The only down side to Le Thai, which is only because of their success is the wait times for seating and take out orders during peak times, so plan accordingly if you plan to dine here.

On top of that terrible service, they tried to add 18% on our bill on a table of 3. They really need to train the servers better.

We checked with the hostess outside and we were told there was a 20 min wait unless we wanted to sit at the wall table in front of the kitchen. Those seats were perfect for two. I had the Awesome Noodles and they lived up to their name. I also tried the beef short rib fried rice with the fried egg on top. Wow!! This was the best fried rice I ever had Fo Sho! My wife had the Pad Kee Mow, another excellent dish. Son much good food in one place. The Rotti  for desert is a must. Any desert with Nutella is a must try and this one was one of ghe best I had.

I always order yellow curry on my first visit to a thai place, because I figure if they can't get the basics right, I don't need to come back to try anything else.  Plus I LOVE yellow curry.  Got it with tofu, and it was delicious!!  Ordered it mild and it had a nice, small kick to it.  Lovely flavor.  Right amount of potatoes, onions, and carrots with plenty of broth.  Also had a thai ice tea which was delicious.  I'll definitely come back to try more on the menu.  Once I experience more of the menu I imagine they'll get 5 stars.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	9P_ykmYyCBhNGcNvrmECfA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

But if you're a local, you prolly never venture into the strip area. So that said, this is a nice local's spot to get some really authentic Thai with nice staff and a cozy atmosphere. It is not classy per se and you order drinks outside it seemed. But the prices are reasonable and really, it's genuine Thai. So if you're in the area, check it out for a nice dinner with friends	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	sXJwXEHR64393fWO4Qdq6A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

IxI1tbzqz9_IOWm0q33grA	4	2012-05-01 00:00:00	This spot has now become a weekly staple for me and my man.  \nThe upside is really good Thai food with super-fresh, colorful and flavorful ingredients.  Price is a tiny bit more than most Thai places but I am happy to pay $10-13 for a plate of noodles when they are SO good!  Price is definitely on par with quality.  The staff is always nice.  The kitchen is happy to add ingredients (we added broccoli and it was only a buck or 2).\nThe downside:  Service is like a roller-coaster one Saturday night our food actually arrived before our cocktails, and it turns out a normal poured crown-n-coke is $10, ouch!  A few days later, we waited more than 30 minutes for our lunch.  Admittedly, They were super-busy with a full lunch crowd, but they were equally busy that Saturday night.\n While the kitchen is happy to add ingredients, they will not substitute noodles, which crushes my dream of having Drunken noodle toppings over the longer, stringy-type served with Pad Thai:(\nI am constantly unhappy with the lack of menu descriptions.  We always order the same thing because it is delicious and we have no real idea what the other dishes are.  It would be so simple to provide brief descriptions on the menu---there are only about 10 items.\nAll this said and done, I still go back, at least once a week because the food is just Delicious!	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	h5bp8gnhYGF23GIlvMyQ1A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

j-QAMjAs5W2rh3sciT7CsA	3	2015-05-09 00:00:00	I got recommended to try Le Thai by two of my co-workers, so I figured I had to give this place a try. We got there around 9:30pm. Put our names down on the list and was told we had a 30-45min wait. No problem at all considering we are right there on freemont street, so we cruised around and checked out some stores while we waited. It was perfect timing because we walked around for about 45mins and headed back, but when we got back to Le Thai there was no greeter there, a worker then came outside and asked if we wanted to put our names down and we said we are on the wait list, she asked our names and then told us she could seat is then. It was good We got seated but seemed like if we didn't go back theyvwouldbhave forgot about us, maybe not I'm sure but that's the vibe the lady and I got. Place is busy and was crammed,pack with tables, not a problem though as many resturants are similar. We ordered a Thai tea, pork jerky, chicken satay, the pad Thai, and yellow curry heat 2. The dishes were all prepared great as in the meats were going very tender and cooked to perfection. The chicken satay was juicy, tender, and the satay sauce was amazing! The pork jery reminded me of smoke meat from back home and was a total opposite of the chicken satay. The satay was sweet and creamy, while the pork jerky with the waterfall sauce was. A sharp, vinegar taste. Not bad and the sticky rice was excellent as I love rice! The yellow curry was good. The carrots, potatoes, onions, and beef were cooked well and the curry was good. The spice level 2 was very mild but nice as dinner went on it kept a nice warming sensation going. My lady's pad Thai was ok. Seemed as though it was already mixed, noodles. Were chopped to make them more manageable to eat maybe? First time I've had pad Thai that came with chopped noodles and pre mixed. There was an aftertaste that I was not familiar with the previous pad Thais I've had in the past. It wasn't my cup of tea. Now the Thai tea, the Thai tea was probably the best I have ever had. It was a nice smooth, sweet, creamy Thai tea with no hints of bitterness or over brewing. A perfect compliment to our meal. Bravo on the Thai tea! It was an over all ok experience. While everything tasted good, it was just that....ok. Nothing jumped out at me with amazing flavors or textures. If I'm in the area I will see stop by for some Thai tea, but other than that my Thai food search is still going. I'm glad I tried Le Thai. You should to, it might be an amazing meal for your taste buds but for me it was ok, except for the Thai tea lol! That was awesome!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	i7K3PDFJzXJSebzCj8UYJw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Our relationships started 5 years when I worked in DTLV and has remained consistent every single visit, even after moving states.  By far one of the best Thai places I've ever tried.\nFrom their Thai iced coffee to their noodle dishes and larb salad, you really can't go wrong .  My go to is always the Awesome noodle with chicken @ level 3 spice . I love everything spicy but be careful not to get crazy because if there is anything left over the heat tends to increase! \nThe space isn't big but the patio is cool and the service is always friendly.  Tree was out server and she was on point and even wore a tiara ! I loved it ! The wait may be annoying sometimes but again it's a small space with quality food, but oh so worth the wait !!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	urTz7Fdk7-F-wCzRSLKbtg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The music was pretty loud so it was hard to hold a conversation.\n\nThe service was pretty good and the waitress was pleasant.  The prices were pretty reasonable, considering their location.  Located right on Fremont St in Downtown Las Vegas.  The table was dirty but hey, it was lunch time and they seemed pretty buisy.\n\nI ordered the yellow curry with chicken over steamed rice.  It was A-Mazing!!  I savoured each and every bite I took.  The curry managed to stain my tongue ring a strange shade of yellow and then green.  \n\nI attempted to go back here on a Sunday but unfortunately they were closed to the public.  I definitely would highly recommend this place for Thai while out in Las Vegas. Just make sure to have a spare tongue ring on stand by, just in case.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	xwEz0tNx2ruD5gYS_W1Stg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It wasn't bad. It wasn't perfect. It was off. It was a bit wonky. Felt a bit rushed. Our Server missed a couple of things that we had requested. The Hostess was also a bit off; wasn't super pleasant but wasn't rude. Just off. The Food Runners seemed more upbeat and "on" with their energy. Just weird. Food delivery was quick.\nFood wise. It was good. FOr the price point, it was pretty good. My number 3 spice level was decent and did start kicking in towards the end of my meal, so kudos! Although my Partner's dish didn't have enough kick, so he took a spoonful of my sauce and added to his to give it some kick, and it worked. The Pad Thai was pretty good!\nPay attention to the Specials Board because no one told us about any specials and once I saw the board, I would have ordered that instead of my Pad Prik.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	sfQXLZGk6beiSuNZYb8iSQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Our reservation was made for 9:30pm but was setback a bit due to our table was located in the patio area and the wind was acting crazy last night.  \n\nWe ordered:\nPad See Ewe: with beef spicy level 2.  The slices of beef were tender and flavorful...actually, the whole bowl of this flat rice noodle is flavorful.  \nShort Rib Fried Rice:  Was delicious as well.  I got this at spice level 0, but it tasted as if it was cooked with some spice.  Maybe the fried rice was cooked in the same wok that was used to cook something else that had spice...\n\nNext time, we will ask for a wedge of lime/lemon to add a touch of citrus note to both of this entree.\n\nDebbie ordered the Awesome Noodle at spicy level 3, but Earl's Pad See Ewe at level 2 was spicier than Debbie's.  Highly advised that you should start at level 1, and ask for the spice rack.  \n\nService was lacking, but we will still return for the food.

I figured I shouldn't drink too much on an empty stomach, so I took the advice of some friends and went next door to Le Thai. The menu is small, only about 10 or 15 things on there. The service was nice, even though they we're starting to close.\n\nI decided on the Drunken noodles with beef. The waitress asked me "How Spicy? 1-5". That caught me off guard, so I told her 4. She told that was extremely hot, so I said OK, make it a 3.5. She laughed. \n\nThe food took a few minutes, but it came out nice and hot. It wasn't that big of a bowl but it was just enough. For $11.95, I thought it would be bigger. The noodles we're kind of greasy though.  Anyways it was pretty spicy. After 3 bites I felt it. Half way through my lips and tongue we're on fire. I really like spicy, so this was good. But it was almost too spicy. Next time I'll try a 3. \n\nThe place is worth checking out. Next time I'm on fremont st. I may try something else. Wasn't overly impressed, wasn't dissapointed.	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	kFxWU1vMLdHERF2149wzCg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

jptDbgGDUKcr3o08664ilw	1	2016-02-17 00:00:00	Last night I had a bad experience at this restaurant. I wanted to try a new restaurant in the area and this was my choice, my girlfriend was waiting for me to get there and she asked the hostess for a table for two, the hostess said she couldn't give a table of the other person wasn't there. She had to wait outside the restaurant until I made it there. Once I was there we asked for a table and she said it will be couple minutes, "let me ask the server if she is ready" so she asked the server and she came back saying that it will be couple more minutes, the restaurant wasn't full or busy at all, it was a Tuesday night. We then asked if possible to wait inside because it was getting cold, the hostess very rude and inconsiderate said that she couldn't do that. After that we decide to leave. Not worth our time waiting for a bad service.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	42wrNRerO9b37w0qYiTO7Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
JPwH3eUY9gHuqUQDkAZ2Qg	4	2014-09-07 00:00:00	We were in the area to attend a concert and decided to get dinner. As we were walking we saw Le Thai and all agreed that's where we wanted to eat.\n\nYou walk up and see it's not that big. Plenty of people inside but we waited only a couple minutes and then were sat down in the back are where they have misters. Smart idea being in vegas to keep cool. As soon as we arrived I could tell immediately they seem to be organized. They got people zooming all around but they are each doing jobs.\n\nI was browsing the menu and I just had to see their curry selection. Something catches my eye and it is the 3 color curry. Never heard of mixing red,yellow, and green curry. As I am trying to be a little healthy during my vacation I chose the tofu and brown rice. OMG the food was good. I stuck with a spice level 2 to be cautious. It was perfect spice level for me. I suggest everyone try the 3 color curry at least once. I don't know any other place that does that. Portion size was decent and filled me up for the night. Price was maybe a couple dollars higher because of the location but well worth it.\n\nI give 4 stars for great service and great food! I'll be back anytime I am in the area and need some thai food!\n\nWarning this place gets packed and there can be a wait. While we were eating people started arriving in packs and had to wait to be seated. This place is gaining popularity!	3	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	1AYTQ-XpQwvbbShaXorsQA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

jSwCNmsCqTZwM28NmrECrA	5	2012-11-04 00:00:00	My wife and I found Le Thai after walking out of Insert Coins downtown on a Saturday night and we took a chance on it.  Small inside dining with a larger outside seating area in the back.  The restaurant is very rustic and mimics what you may find in Thailand The place was filled which was a good sign for almost 9pm at night.  We took a few seats at the bar and ordered.  My wife always gets the beef massaman curry wherever she goes and it was amazing, great levels of flavor.  I got the special which was a beef fried rice, it was one of the best meals I have had in this town!  We have found our favorite Thai place in Las Vegas.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	dxE-Ua_zo1pP-fwerl3krw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

JTvzsiSyM8H4PZD7voEJOg	2	2015-08-04 00:00:00	I only knew Le Thai as the place that gave free hugs with Yelp check-ins. I was kinda disappointed that they no longer were doing it. I was ready for some hugging :)  Maybe a hug would've given you a higher rating than 2 stars from me jk.\n\nReally the hug was nothing related to the rating. It was just all not so good to give them anything higher. Waited a long time to get seated. Understandable, a busy place on a Friday night. The girl up in front was friendly. She did at least get the name right when our table was ready.\n\nAfter being seated, one of the servers took our drink orders and gave us some menus to look at, so far it was running smoothly. An then the heat kicked it. They have these big misters to keep it cool while dining however it was mostly off while we were there. A few minutes at the start and basically the end. It was hot and sweaty. They filled our glasses with water once in while but not to often. Most of the service was slow.\n\nFood wise, at least the stuff we ordered, was aight. The papaya salad was too salty for me, it must've have been the first time I tried it so maybe it supposed to be  that way!? Anyways one taste of it and was like you guys can have the rest I'm good. The pork jerky was ok nothing special. The 3 color curry beef was decent I love curry in general and this one wasn't that bad. The thai style fried rice with shrimp wasn't that bad also. Kind of picked at most of the shrimp though. And then there was the drunken noodles. Honestly i don't even remember it. All the food we ordered was served family style and mostly with some rice. It filled 4 people up.\n\nI also tried the thaijito it was 10 bucks for a small cup. It was strong which was good but because it was hot and at the time I was thirsty with a empty cup of water I gulped that sucker down and that was it. Taste refreshing while it lasted.\n\nFestive decorated and loud. A nice number of seating and a bar area. Would I be back? Maybe if friends wanna go but other then that probably not. Hugs.	9	11	7	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

JvNcsrmugpAhZtjR0LX75A	1	2014-06-16 00:00:00	I am not really sure what this place is about.  I have tried now twice to eat here with zero luck.  This Saturday night there were seven of us for dinner.  We were told about an hour wait and were given seats in their waiting area.  We ordered some beers and a bottle of wine and waited...  and waited.... and waited.  Until two hours had passed.  We saw table after table getting seated, parties of two, parties of four.. I finally asked 'Is it possible for you to NOT seat them so we can get a table?  Cause you know a few two tops or a few four tops would accommodate a table for seven.'  This apparently is beyond them.  From the sounds of it they have one table for large parties and unless that specific table is open you are out of luck.  At 11pm we finally got really mad and just went to Hennessy's who seated us immediately and had food on the table promptly.  So we arrived around 8pm and finally left at 11pm.......  CRAZY!  I will never go here again because not only did they not seat us, they acted like we were nuts trying to get into their restaurant with a party of seven.  You are right we were crazy!  Never again.	3	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	WbUPo7dCgVCxTpqOwfT2Kw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

You absolutely must start with the Thai pork jerky making sure you dip it in the delicious waterfall sauce, but trust me no matter your appetizer choice you will not be disappointed. For an entree I would highly recommend either the pad see ewe or short rib fried rice as they both are filling and delicious and if your daring and like spicy go with the 5.	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	RjMWqTW1ZXp0ilkl_ZXs2A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

JXyS7zBlZvT0nDXtiav4mw	3	2015-02-01 00:00:00	Read some great reviews for Le Thai and was referred to by Scott - the manager of Lola's in Summerlin.  So, we came to give it a try.  Very hip, cool, laid back atmosphere.  Love the comradery of the staff.  Everyone seems to get along great.  We sat at the bar near the window, so you can chat it up with "Prince" our bartender and people watch outside.  First, GREAT pours at this bar.  Really "healthy" if you know what I mean ;)  I had the chicken pad thai - spicy levels run 1-5 - I got a 2 and it had a good kick, it was considered medium - don't think I could handle the 3.  My hubs got the beef pad thai - 3.  Both were good but we've had better.  Great portions, served hot - noodles were good.  We love all these great new places off of Fremont Street and this place jams.  I will say the drinks were a bit pricey - kind of like Strip prices?  I was only drinking vodka and club soda and was charged $10 a drink.  I try to justify it as you are paying for a great experience and fun night too, but think they should take a simple drink like that down to $8.  Too pricey for Fremont, guys!  Gear it towards locals!	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	xVfK4hxPqr57SRleHT1U5w	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

First I went into the restaurant and waited to be seated. Someone after 5 mins walked to me and said that I need to be outside the restaurant to be seated. Then a waitress came to me and said it will be 2 hours. When I was at this place, I saw at least 50% of this place empty. I am not sure why they said 2 hr wait time. I am from Chicago and a visitor here. I will advice not to go to this place with such attitudes in the service industry.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	pOdHoIx4Z8Vy1FEIKcoFdQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I love me some Thai food.\n\n They do have a higher level of spiciness. So if you order a 3, I'm sure your mouth will be watering. I made a mistake and ordered a 6 on my Thai Beef salad & boy did I need extra water. I'm a big Thai beef salad fan &  I don't think they have the very good Thai beef salad. It needs a little less carrots and little more lettuce.\n\nThey, however, have one of the best Pad Thai in town! Order it as a level 1 & it's perfect! The noodles are cooked very well & not overly cooked where it's soggy and squishy. \n\nThe location is smack dap on Fremont street next to all the popular bars so it does get pretty busy at night & the wait is pretty intense especially when you are drunk! Sometimes you can tip the guy in the front so he can let you in right away.. Lol! But you didn't hear that from me!	3	2	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	pxzs-Dy2hXTis-PuNCV37Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The chicken satay was very tender, and the peanut sauce was delicious. I ordered the Red Chicken Curry for dinner and it was pretty good. I think we both ordered it with a level 1 (she made me nervous that it would be too spicy) I loved the spice level, but my friend found it a little too spicy. Cute place, and I really liked the covered outdoor patio. \n\n12/14 I had to update my review. The Tom Kha soup with shrimp is absolutely delicious. We also tried the ginger fried rice was so good.

I used to be a waiter, and I pay attention to these details). That put a cloud over the rest of the meal, regardless of how good the experience was after that. And it was good. The food was great as always (chicken pad thai and yellow curry), and the waiter did give plenty of attention after the initial neglect. What drove me crazy, though, is that it wasn't busy. And there were at least four servers I counted. There may have been parties at seven or eight tables max. We were seated out back, and I kept seeing waiters just standing around, almost as if they needed something to do. Well, there was a table of two just a few feet away that sure could have used some service.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ASgoY4o95sZzlidacI4Omw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

My nose might as well have jumped off my face and made a permanent home here, it was that great.\n\nSo after I had one of the most intense smellgasms of my life, I was seated and ordered up one of my favorite delicacies, dragon pearl tea. The tea was delivered with a kettle of hot water and nice little glass. I let it steep and looked over the menu. The prices can be a bit intimidating, but let me reassure you, you're getting what you pay for. I went ahead and ordered a stir fry and went on enjoying my tea.\n\nThe food blew me away, it was seriously not what I expected. The spice complimented the flavors so well and the tea worked perfectly with the dish. I couldn't be happier and before I knew it, the bowl was empty and my buddy Aaron was staring at me in disbelief as I MURDERED that meal. Seriously, I had to call the stir fry family and tell them the bad news.\n\nGo to Le Thai, order as much as you can. Tell them Ryan sent you and they'll look at you confused because they don't know who I am.	3	3	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	k57azJnTJXQwYlsFEUOkPQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The food is authentic, the portions substantial, and the staff actually cares about both the food and the customers. \n   They will also make things Gluten-free, which is important to the gluten allergic members of my family. \n   It is a very popular place, which can mean waits during prime hours, but mid afternoon or late night is usually wait free. I highly recommend the Ga Pow, or the 3 color curry. Also, the Pad Thai is the best I have found in town.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	rYZ8uWkQ3_grvp-Qn2Bt5g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The place didn't open for dinner till 4p so we headed over to a nacho spot close by and had margaritas. We came back about 5 after 4 and the place was already filled up, we choose bar seating because it was much too hot to eat on the patio. The bartender was friendly and attentive. Making sure we had waters, an over few of the menu and trying to get 3 beer coazies for our check-in on yelp. I ordered the wing appetizer and pad Thai with peanut sauce, my girlfriend got the yellow curry and crab something or other.  The food was hot and although not my favorite pad Thai, I prefer something more traditional it was good. All in all we enjoyed the food. Nice little spot to have a decent meal in Vegas.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	IHO1oAX0PrEQo5VYuipX7g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
kc-o3446IbiIU4_W3-BX5A	1	2016-06-03 00:00:00	Another mediocre Thai place.  Actually calling it Thai food is misleading.  This is Westernized Thai food.  We almost walked when we noticed non-Thai chefs.  Oily pork, somtam (papaya salad) that was allegedly Lao style.  If it was Lao style it would have been too spicy for me too eat.  My wife whom is Thai barley touched it.  We ordered coconut water that came in a can.  WTF, go buy REAL coconuts.  On to top of that overpriced.  But non-Thais love this watered down version of Thai food.  I'm American, but lived in Thailand for 2 yrs.  Since living in the U.S. there's only one place in Hollywood that comes close to what Thai food should taste like.  The Search continues. . .	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	tEPyR6Idm1wphbQq2ZShyw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I usually order the beef waterfall which I love and the wings during happy. They also have a good selection of beers and drinks as well. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. Overall good place and really good food but I only gave 4stars because I think certain late nights the food was a tiny bit better then some of the days that I had stopped in.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	bERUtMtp2QZ0flVywPO8zg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Great environment to stop by for a dinner during Vegas trips. The Thai food here is authentic, yet modern and original. Their "Amazing Noodles" are sincerely amazing and a delicious up from the popular Pad Thai dish. A must try is also the Beef Short Rib Fried Rice. It's sweet yet savory and compliments all the other spicy, family style Thai dishes. The Red Curry and Eggplant Tofu was so rich and the sauces had just the right amount of spice (we got medium). As with all Thai restaurants, they're not joking when they say something's spicy so be cautious!\n\nI especially loved he outdoor seating with the patio lights and side bar. Perfect place for a Thai tea, Thai beer, and hearty comfort food away from the overplayed chain restaurants.\n\nThe lasting impression? "A hidden gem off the Strip and a must try in Vegas."	6	3	6	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	DONwuwg9iySZ7LFjtcHdCA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It was very good and very strong. Not sure if it's the best lunchtime drink to get unless you can walk around buzzed for a while. My friend got the mojito and was happy as well.\n\nFor lunch we both got the 3 curry with brown rice. It was very good, but even the "mild" was very spicy.\n\nService was pretty good even though they were very busy. (Most of the tables were full the entire time we were there.) We sat outside on the patio which was great.\n\nNext time I will probably order the Pad Thai, because I don't think I can review a Thai place without trying my favorite Thai staple.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	5uwsIgJFakD6AJ_wji6ThA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The service was really good, decor is pretty good and really fast with the food, we were a group of 4 and had gone for lunch. 3 of others took a lunch combo and I got a Pad Kee Mao (drunken noodles) with Chicken with a level 3 spice which was pretty spicy but I guess I could have done 4 too. But I would recommend doing only a 2/3, that is like bearable spice.\n\nThe area around the restaurant there is lots to see, so the is definitely a nice place to visit if you want to have lunch around the area.	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	45PdJ5LYQIL8_qf4UdbpPw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The last time I went it was happy hour so I ordered a Thai Mojito which had basil in place of the traditional mint.. it was refreshing and very tasty and my girl friend got a Thai tea which was good but could have had a little more tea flavor. (We also were able to get the yelp check in offer of a free Thai tea when you order a second) \n\nNext we got the Thai style wings which was on the happy hour menu. They were crispy and delish I will definitely be ordering these again! \n\nNext we ordered chicken Pad See Ewe and it was really yummy. The noodles were a wider noodle and the flavor was on point. \n\nAnd the best for last... Short ribs fried rice! I order this dish every time we come and it never disappoints. The meat is sooo tender and work well with the rice. Spice level of 2 for all dishes which gives a little kick but nothing overbearing otherwise your mouth will be on fire.\n\nService... our waitress was really good and wish I could remember her name. The hostess could have been a little more friendlier. She wanted to seat us right by the entrance which I am not a fan of considering I'm always cold.. when I requested a table from the main seating area she told me she would have to clear off a table in a not so nice way.. sorry you have to take time out of your not so busy day to clear off a table!  \n\nAll in all it's one of my favorite places to come when I'm in the downtown Vegas area and I will be back!	2	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	wso-XwrmzpWH_iA4oEkxrQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

While on a Vegas bender a few weeks ago I discovered Le Thai. I had some sort of Thai mojito and the short rib fried rice (3 star). I can't stop thinking about it!! The short rib fried rice is the best fried rice I have ever had in my 42 years of walking this planet!!!! Since coming back home to Los Angeles, I can't even stir up any interest in going to my favorite local Thai place...

Their instructions were simple- go to Le Thai - ask for Puoy (the owner) and enjoy.\n\nI followed my instructions and gotta say I was BLOWN AWAY by this food.  The place is a trendy hole in the wall style joint... with outside dining and a really hip ambiance... As we walked in I knew I already liked it- and this was before I ordered the "Waterfall Beef" appetizer.  OH MY GOD this stuff is good.  I seriously want to take a bath in the waterfall sauce (except Im sure it would burn).  After this- I thought there is no way they can outdo themselves with the entrees, but with both the Pad Thai and the "Awesome noodles" (who doesn't love something that has Awesome in the title?) were superb.\n\nTake a cool, fun atmosphere-  add in the most amazing flavorful beef entree (perhaps ever?), and great food on top of that and you have some serious "winner winner chicken dinner."  Will definately go back. (maybe tonight?)	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	GcEaEhVBp0DcAbgdPw41eg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
l1Zg3ziozpXreMRFCgQrHw	4	2013-04-14 00:00:00	Introduced to this place by our good friends David and Shondra. The place is very small and even their covered patio wasn't much bigger but where small in size, this place is huge on flavor. It was Saturday night, before six p.m. and there was an hour wait for a table because of reservations. We managed to get a seat at the 'bar' which is a small counter on the patio where there is side by side seating. The food we ordered was awesome and they had a very nice selection of imported beer. I love Singha, the more commonly available Thai beer, but I tried the Lucky Buddha beer from China, which comes in a nice Buddha shaped bottle. It was actually good beer but since I am not a frequent beer drinker, it might have been more to my taste than to others. In any event, I can hardly wait to go back again and try some of the other dishes on the menu. I will make a reservation well in advance this time.\n\nThe only reason I gave less than five stars is the wait time for a rez but solve that my making one next time.	3	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ENcAGHpKz-37bObY4TVSkQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

l5XFuppSWdKXWMkHdVD8hw	4	2011-12-30 00:00:00	Walking down the street with my phone, I was trying to locate where it was. I had the address, but we just couldn't find it. Then my friend pointed, and said, "There!" I don't know if it was because of the night, but we couldn't see a clear sign for Le Thai. I actually expected lighted sign or something. Luckily, they closed late, because we were heading there near midnight.\n\nTom Kah (Coconut Soup)- 3 1/2-stars- I got the chicken and asked for spicy level-4. You won't taste how hot it is, probably because of the soup, but you'll feel it the next day--if you get my drift. The flavor is citrus, sweet, light, and tart. It's covered with fresh mushrooms--I found the chicken on the bottom with all the hot spices. The dish includes green onion, ginger, and lime leaf (Kaffir?). For the price, the dish is a little light. Thankfully, I had been eating all day--literally, so I didn't need to be stuffed once again. As a note, my friend got the fried rice, which was exploding with flavor, and the rice definitely gives more body. This dish may need some extra heft to average itself out.\n\nChang Beer- 4-stars- As their main beer of choice, I think, it is actually really good. The beer of Thailand, is a light gold beer, lightly flavored and smooth to drink.\n\nAmbiance- The location is trendy with the hard to see sign. Wood planks line the interior and exterior. You can see interesting businesses outside, as this area seems to be a place for cool, artsy people end up. It has a very open, natural feel to it. In the back is an open-air patio, and with the extremes in temperature, I can imagine it gets random use. The music is very hip, mostly remixes with an indie feel to it. We were both surprised they were playing certain songs in a Thai restaurant. They also used iPhones and iPads for orders, which for me, being from Hawaii was an interesting upgrade. \n\nService- I was surprised there was no Thai person to be seen anywhere. I kind of need that oomph to get me excited. The service was friendly and helpful. The kitchen is open, so you can also see them preparing your meals.\n\nConclusion- The location being Downtown has a more laid-back clientele which may not totally appreciate this restaurant. Yet, I've also seen younger people, looking for the deals, and they would definitely enjoy this place. It's a little something to search for, but rather worth it when you find it.	1	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	NMOoQ0FTn2NlJylSxSVseA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
L9ZnNzLZRsf7See7vdfTnA	3	2017-06-20 00:00:00	I'd heard a lot of hype about Le Thai, so I decided to visit here with my fiancé for date night. When we arrived, it was a Sunday at about 6 pm, it was fairly empty inside. We were quickly seated and our waiter took our drink order. My fiancé and I both ordered Ga Pow, I got shrimp and he got ground chicken. Maybe it's because I eat a lot of Americanized food, but I wasn't expecting it to come out so...wet. There was liquid at the bottom of the dish that I normally don't seem to get when I order stir fry. Again, that could be because I don't normally Thai food. Even disregarding that though, the ground chicken my fiancé had was not very good. After all the hype, I really expected something fantastic and I didn't seem to find that in either of our dishes or the egg rolls we ordered as an appetizer. I might be willing to give it another chance, but only if I happen to be in the area. I won't go out of my way to go downtown to eat it.	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	yTV3KHOm4-RQpClyYKGnkw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The restaurant was quite packed.. We decided to sit in the patio. They had the heaters going which was nice..\n\nWe ordered the following vegan dishes. The lady who was waiting us was very forthcoming and told us exactly which items were vegan and the new that were not..\n\n1. Drunken noodles - we ordered spicy 4 out of 5 and it was a really tasty and flavorful.\n2. Masamam curry - we ordered spicy 4 out of 5.. They had a lot of curry sauce and vegetables in the dish.. It was really flavorful and tasty as well,, \n\nThey served us  brown rice on request. \n\nAll in all a great experience! Will definitely go back to Le Thai restaurant again. \n\nPs: right around 10 pm the neighborhood bar starts playing loud music. If you are out in the patio, you will not to be able to hear anything else but the loud music.  Be prepared with ear plugs..

That being said, Thai was all I could think about while I was at the club. When our stomachs finally forced us to break free from the crowd, we had a good 20 minutes to get downstairs & in line before the 3AM close.Grabbed a couple of dishes, Short Rib Fried Rice w/ medium spice (AMAZING) & Chicken Satay which was pretty standard & nothing special. Back to the rice... Every scoop had juicy threads of short rib intertwined with the grains & medium spice had just the right amount of heat without being too intrusive & allowing to enjoy the flavors of the waterfall sauce, garlic, etc... \n\nNot sure if it was because we were drinking, hungry as hell & it was 3AM but this satisfied the hell out of my late night munchies. If I'm ever back in this neck of the woods (which I highly doubt), I'll definitely be back...	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	6eS1LvgPp_1xa6mhoI7HIw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It was mainly local people eating there which was strange because it's right on Fremont Street, but it's closer to the El Cortez as opposed to the "Experience".  I'd much rather eat where the locals eat any day! Everyone was very friendly! We really enjoyed the Pad Kee Mao/drunken noodles and the 3 curry dish.

It's so nice to have a more authentic Asian food experience than those offered in the casinos.  The Thai salad with tofu was delicious and zesty!   We usually get red or panang curry as our entree but tonight we decided to try their 3 curry which was a blend of red, green and yellow curry.  This was good, but not great.  It was acceptable and I would eat it again, but I would definitely order panang or red curry before that.  Lastly, I appreciated that a 2 star (out of 5) was a hotter medium.  Service was very nice as well.  And they text you when your table's ready so you can gamble/explore during the wait.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	R6bLB4-C8vR6mnAiKH5BKQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It's right down the street from the Fremont experience but it is so worth it. The sauce was tangy and light and perfectly complimented the salty dense jerky. We also had some of the noodle dishes which were all great but I can't remember the names. Really great prices and a full bar which is a plus. We had a big group had plenty left over and everyone had drinks and we got out of there spending around 20.00 per person. Best Thai I've had in a while. Can't wait to go back for that jerky. Only negative was the service was a little slow.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Kh0FOgeO24VaDHRCCQx11g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We ordered the mango sticky rice with dinner. Sooooo good. Le Thai is the only place we'll go for Thai food. No need to look any further. Le Thai is the best \n\n\n5/11/17. We had dinner here again. Even though I love the green curry and the short rib fried rice, I decided to try the drunken noodles. It did not disappoint.  Kathy was a server. It's our second time with Kathy. She remembered us and what we had the last time. She suggested a heat level for my dish and it was spot on. Now I can humbly say that I don't have a "go to" dish as everything I've had so far has been excellent.

I ordered beef and meat ball noodle soup for my fiance and Thai style garlic fried rice for myself with spicy level 5. Food was average but really spicy. I didn't expect such heat from American Thai restaurant. To me, this place is more like a bar restaurant. It's nothing to compare with Lotus of Siam.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	VzBoi7n5pee-iLx5dc5BHA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
LOCWoVtrv0BMPoM6u29kvw	3	2014-01-29 00:00:00	Don't hesitate to stop in to Le Thai if you're in the area!\n\nLe Thai is popular Thai restaurant in the heart of East Fremont.  The staff is wonderfully friendly...even when they are slammed...what else would you expect from a place with the visionary prowess to offer free hugs with a Yelp Check-in?  \n\nMost of their dishes are above average.  I usually go with curry dishes when I'm here because there noodles are a little less consistent and have been over cooked a couple of times.  The bottom line for me is that you are paying a little more because of the location, but there is not a single item I have tried that I don't enjoy more at another Thai restaurant in town.  The food is certainly good enough for me to stop in if I am on East Fremont though.\n\nThey have an enclosed patio in the back that is delightful when the weather is nice and heated well during colder times...avoid it in the summer though.  The shade is not enough to keep the temps down.\n\nCome here if you're on East Fremont and in the mood for Thai.\nCome here if you have had too much to drink and need a bite while you sober up...their hours are certainly accommodating to the drinking crowd.\nCome here when you are lonely and need to cash in on the free hug!	8	5	4	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
LOMCqYJ1hOpXEiWf7cpP9A	3	2014-05-15 00:00:00	Okay, the food is nothing short of amazing, but come on and step up the service! The 45 minute wait didn't bother me since close by there are several bars to grab a beer. They even have an app to check the wait time and get notified when your table is ready. The app is called "no wait" and if you download it, you can see wait times of various restaurants wait times in your area. The food we ordered: Thai chicken wings, crab rangoons, red curry pork, short rib fried rice, and chicken pad see ew. The spice level 4/5 was ordered and it was hot! The wings were small but crispy and tasty. The short rib fried rice came with a runny fried egg on top and it was amazing. The shredded bits of tender meat elevate the rice to another level. The rest of the food was above par as well. Now as for the service.... It was ridiculous how bad it is. We received our appetizers and we still had to utensils. We asked the waiter for some forks and he brought the three of us 3 forks and 1 napkin then jetted off leaving us there laughing. We pondered splitting it in thirds since the chicken wings were nice and greasy lol. It took about 10 minutes for us to flag down a waiter and ask for more. We never got refills on our drinks. It's just sad, I'd give this place five stars if the service was even decent.	3	0	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

ls-rXgQKw61j5TFR9etwJg	4	2012-07-20 00:00:00	I've been hearing all kinds of good things about Le Thai, but I have never been in the neighborhood around dinner time.  Last night, I was downtown for a happy hour when my tummy rumbles set in.  I knew it was about to be time for Le Thai and I was excited.\n\nWe were seated in the outdoor section of this tiny restaurant.  It was pretty hot out, even at 8pm but there are water misters going to cool things off.  When you combine that mist with the warm air, it almost gives the feeling of being in southeast asia.  The atmosphere was definitely not "steps away from casinos and neon" and that's a good thing.\n\nFor an appetizer we had our Thai go-to: chicken satay.  The peanut sauce was delicious although a tad bland.  The chicken was perfect.  The pieces were much larger than most other satay i have seen.  The chicken was also perfectly tender and juicy.  I can only dream of being able to cook chicken that perfectly.\n\nMy entree was Pad Kee Mow.  I ordered with chicken at medium spice.  DC ordered Pad See Eew with chicken at medium spice.  Both dishes were fantastic - among the best Thai food either of us have had.  As many others have noted, however, the food is damn spicy.  I generally have a high tolerance for spice and the medium was just a little much.  Heat aside, the food was incredible.  I want to try everything else on the menu.\n\nOur service was lazy, but not in a bad way.  Maybe relaxed is a better word.  Servers were friendly and took orders on an iPhone.  Neat little touch.  The music was like a mix between West Elm and a dance club - very good vibe for the relaxed atmosphere.  We'll definitely be returning to Le Thai to try the rest of the menu (only this time with a slightly milder spice profile).	2	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	IlRmSTn19xM2Vi7xtjzAhw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I thought that was kinda ridculous but went ahead and ordered anyway.  I ordered the spring rolls, awesome shrimp noodles and curry chicken.  The curry chicken was great; very flavorful and saucy.  I got it medium spicy because some of the other reviewers said it was really hot but it wasn't.  I could've actually went with spicy hot.  The awesome noodles which are overpriced at $10 was a disappointment because of the bean sprouts.  I'm not really a fan of bean sprouts and there were just too many but the noodles were good.   Surprisingly there was a lot of shrimp and they were cooked just right.  Spring rolls were good also.	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	putDIQFiBXhEJCe-AYe_YA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We showed up on time and told the again rude hostess that we had one more she told me we would then have to wait for another table to open up I replied we had one more and a few weren't even eating we could squeeze them in she told me no and with a bad attitude told me I could juSt talk to her manager if I didn't like it I told her I would the manager came up already with the same bad attitude as the hostess and told us to bad. I told her also some weren't eating and we could squeeze them she said no so when asked how long we would have to wait she told me well I don't know with a face like I was stupid for asking.

I ordered them as spicy as they dared to make it, and while I waited for my order, my friends offered me some of the rice they ordered, which was fried up with some short-ribs... (hmm that's new..) It ended up tasting pretty good actually, and had just a little bit of heat to enhance its flavor.\n\nI sat at the bar with my friends who are regulars there, and once my food came out I dug in.... WOO.... there was the heat, and spicy it certainly was. Nothing eye-watering for me.. but I'm sure it would be overwhelming for others. The heat, the pork, the noodles... it was good. The noodles itself didn't seem to taste very authentic Thai, but I figured I can't really base the restaurant off of something that seemed to be more a house specialty.\n\nGood service, kind folks, and a fairly crowded environment most of the time. Combie that with good food? yup... I'd say it was a nice visit and good enough for me to come back if I'm in the area again...

lznm3ZyQgtOPUEEdgrbVxQ	4	2014-05-19 00:00:00	This may just be one of my new favorite lunch spots downtown! Some of the things I love about this place:\n\n1. The atmosphere is quaint with a down to earth feeling. You can see the kitchen from the main dining area and the outdoor seating area has a great feel to it. The bamboo is a nice touch!\n\n2. Their short rib fried rice was superb. I also love getting a mixed vegetable stir fry with chicken - it sounds simple but the flavor is unreal. Oh, and the peanut sauce they serve with the chicken satay...mmm!!!\n\n3. Every time I go there has been a wait, but I assume that is because it has been peak lunch hour. I really don't like waiting around - but this place is awesome because they take your number and text you when your table is ready! (My newest tradition for the longer waits is to go across the street to Park for a quick drink at the bar while I wait). \n\n4. Their lunch special is great if you are in town at the right time. For $9.95 you pick a dish and a drink - great combo. \n\n5. Their portions are perfectly sized. They are not overbearing at all!\n\n \nNot my favorite: \n\n1. The service. I asked several questions about dishes on the menu, but for some reason the server did not understand what I was asking. I also asked for my dish sans mushrooms...low and behold - mushrooms came! Another time my drink never came and the portion size was incorrect. This is something that can be improved on obviously - so it doesn't bring down my overall rating that much!	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	uyoUkPvmVjFMcjs9NIomAA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

M6tvsWxT5NnqOnCf7ZDAKQ	5	2012-10-18 00:00:00	I've been meaning to write this review for a couple of weeks now. My friends and I used to frequent the restaurant when it just opened. Most of us thought the food was good, HOWEVER, the service was really crappy. They didn't have enough waiters, thus they were careless, i.e. not bringing out everyone's silverware at the same time, forgetting orders, etc. We decided not to come back. \n\nSince we work downtown, there are only so many places to go, so recently a friend and I decided to give it anoooother chance and WHOA were we surprised! First of all the portions are larger than before, and the food is better than before. We've tried the wings, the jerky and all of the curries and everything was fantastic! Plus the have some accesible wine, beer and cocktail options. \n\nThe most important thing though, and the reason I wil keep coming back is the service. I believe their management became aware of the quality of the service offered and remedied the situation. On all of my last visits I was greeted cheerfully, and was waited on promptly and friendly throughout the meal.	2	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Se3XL5Opy0e2cHbxxjs2ZQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Then we saw the sign - score! We had the chicken pad Thai and chicken red curry. We both really loved the meal. Decency was all that was preventing is from licking the bowls. The chicken was lean breast meat and the quality was obvious. The price was around $26 for both items. Dishes can be customized for spice level 1-5. 3 is considered hot so we went with 1.5. My sister loves spice but she found this level to be just right. It added lots without taking away or being unpleasant. The restaurant isn't fancy, it's funky and fun though. Service was bang on. Wish it was closer to home as this place would be our regular stop.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	-zHcPJdu9uBpmP_20uHsHg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
mgNKT5VouhjOLC--E3lToQ	4	2012-01-20 00:00:00	I got my chance to try Le Thai when I was downtown last night.  I had read the Yelp reviews that gave this place a great rating, and I had to give it a go.\n\nI got the Tom Kha soup with chicken - spicy level 3.  The soup was fantastic.  The 3 was the correct spiciness.  I could have gone with 4 as it turned out, but it might have been to overwhelming.  The stock was wonderful.  The seasonings were right on, and the top had a good number of mushrooms slices floating on it.  I think it needed some more chicken, but for the price, it was quite good the way it was.\n\nAs others have noted, this is a very small place. About ten tables in a small area with two side seating bars each holding 5 people.  It's a pleasant space with nice wicker chairs.\n\nService was quick and pleasant.  This is certainly worth a re-visit to try one of the noodle dishes.	3	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

There is a small seating area outside good for people watching. The place is easily overlooked and located on Freemont Street sort of across from Insert coins.

I suggest parking in the public parking area to avoid the street meters.\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is a hole in the wall with the back patio being much larger equipped with water misters to cool you down during a hot summer night. Started off with a Thai ice tea which are gigantic here. I tried the Thai style wings which everyone raved about and they didn't disappoint. The portion was large and the dipping sauce was yummy. For my main entree I went with the Basil pork #2 spiciness which was not very spicy by flavorful. The portion was large and I could only eat half of the bowl.\n\nI can't say enough about my waitress Panissara - she was awesome, friendly and constantly checked in to make sure I was taken cared of! \n\nOverall I'm a fan of Le Thai and would return next time I'm in the downtown area.	4	3	4	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	o4tYl3Hz0oDfpNn4k02DCw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Located on Freemont Street in what is the old strip Le Thai is serving up delicious steaming bowls of Thai noodle goodness. \n\nThis dish I had was called awesome flat noodles and there is no better way to describe it. \n\nThe restaurant is small but offers patio and indoor seating with mist outside for those hot desert days. A great beer, wine and cocktail list really round this place off as both a day and night time place to get out of the heat. \n\nOur service was friendly and our noodles were, well, awesome! \n\nIf we had found this place earlier in our trip I am sure we would have eaten here more than once!	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	W2KKFZ5mrl3Qd70ni5eNnw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I have been in to dine with large groups and small groups multiple times, and it seems as if there is always some sort of issue. Once I was here and their credit card machine was "out of order" so we had to walk down the street to a casino ATM to get cash out. The last time I was there, I called to make a reservation at 11:45 AM and the hostess informed me that they only would take reservations over the phone after 12 PM. Once we arrived our food was great but their service once again was subpar. Take out might be the best way to go with this place!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	EjWM4GiET10EXzVfOuvNWA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

MrayqdIJUim7Ym7XTQBn2Q	1	2016-11-30 00:00:00	On a recent trip to downtown Las Vegas, four of us had an OK meal at Le Thai.  When we put our name on the wait list, we noticed that their host (Asian female) was extremely inefficient and rude.  She told us that it would be at least 45 minutes wait, but we were seated after about 10minutes.   The food and service were good but the food was more expensive or at par with other famous Las Vegas Thai restaurants.\n\nFew days later we visited Le Thai again and were pleased to find another host (Hispanic female).  This person told us the wait would be at least one hour.  We returned after a long stroll, and this person told us to be seated inside the heated area right in front of the take out window.  We waited another 30 minutes. Then the host told us that it is our turn, but the only seating they have is bar seating facing a back wall, as they have a reservation for 12!  As we walked out we found at least four unoccupied tables with seating for four people.\n\nShe never even apologized for the inconvenience she caused.  Why did she bother to even put our name on the wait list?  I am sure that she thought that we will never return.\n\nI have a message for this establishment.  You might be able to charge top dollar for a mediocre meal to tourists who have no other options for Thai food in downtown Las Vegas.  But, you survive also because of the locals.  If you keep employing idiots, and these idiots are rude and unfriendly, your customers will choose other Thai restaurants such as Lotus of Siam Garden and Hong Kong Garden especially when they have the ability to get on their car drive a few miles!   I sincerely hope that you fire these idiots and employ an experienced host who is friendly to your customers.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	VI0DibtMdPKi8kb5aAQcHg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We got the Waterfall Beef and the Drunken noodles.  I am not sure if the sticky rice was all that, but I put the waterfall sauce on it and that helped.  The drunken noodles were really good, but plan to try other than chicken next time - we did not really care for the ground chicken texture.  Our food came out very quickly and the staff is very attentive and friendly.  We plan to return and try more items on the menu.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	jVHkjik8lNHDPqB8Yq7FUA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

MT8m3UMD91jOW-cs5oUvdw	5	2013-03-05 00:00:00	This is THE gem of downtown Vegas. Ask any native, and they will undoubtedly rave about it. The atmosphere, the food, the drinks - it's perfect for a work lunch or dinner on Friday night.\nI have yet to try anything I don't like. The sticky rice in the jerky was dry, but that's the only negative I can find. The heat is on a scale of 1-5. I usually get a 0 because I'm a baby, but I've tried all of my friends' various numbers. We've found the heat to be inconsistent based on the different cooks, so ask for the spice rack if you like things hot. \nThey open at 11:30, but I've noticed a "soft opening" earlier, around 11:15 or so. Make sure to get there RIGHT as they open, or any group bigger than two is going to have to wait a bit for a table. On 30 min lunch breaks, this is no bueno. You can make a reservation for dinner, but not for lunch. \nThe price is excellent and this is definitely not your average cheap thai place.

Initial thoughts upon entering, the restaurant was slow but it was the middle of the day on a Friday. We chose to set in the back deck area which was very nice except I think the mist machines are a bit too much, they are nice but maybe a little bit less as water builds up on the table, food, etc. \n\nOnto the food: The wings are to die for. Seriously, so good. You will not be disappointed. I had the Pad Thai with a level 3 on the 1-5 scale of heat. Again, very good. Would recommend to anyone. Something like $3 canned beers which is a nice change from staying on the strip.\n\nI saw someone comment on the music being too "BET", maybe whoever is working controls the music but the mix that was on while we were there was mumford and sons, and some other indie music.\n\nProbably my favorite meal in Vegas	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	JaCW74CnLSzGFwNRlSd1vg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Unfortunately those had gluten, but our waitress was really helpful and accommodating.  They manager even came over to give me options like the other members of the group.  I ended up with a Thai salad minus the oyster sauce.  Yum.  I appreciated that they were attentive without making an embarrassingly big deal about my dietary needs.  My three curry was excellent.  The other people had green curry and spicy eggplant and pad sei ew.  They said they were great. Most of the menu can be gluten and dairy free, so I really had a lot of choices.

Perhaps it's the drunks on Fremont binge-ing on late night cuisine; their altered perception has them believing this place is gold. I used to feel that way about Egg McMuffins in my drunken days... \n\nI knew something was off when I ordered and they asked how spicy on a scale of 1-4. My maiden voyage to this establishments, I was with a girlfriend from down home in the Bayou. She ordered hers a 4 and they guy said, "Wow, that's really spicy!" She responded, "we're from Louisiana, we can handle the heat." They guy swayed us, we ordered 3s and it was child's play. We had tickets to a show, so when re-offered to make our food, we declined. The curry's we ordered tasted exactly the same. Panang should not taste like the yellow curry. It was sweet coconut with a medium spice level. The dish just fell flat. My second visit I got the Tom Kha soup! Very good, huge portion. Definitely one of the better versions I've tasted, but not really hitting the Tom Kha spot. Soup shouldn't be your best dish, especially in a Thai joint. \n\nService was okay. Nothing too stellar. Actually, nothing about Le Thai is too memorable. How is this place hailed as a one of the best in Vegas?! \n\nThis place should be renamed Le Sigh.	13	10	10	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Very small place so expect to wait a bit, I suggest making reservations if you can. Everything I have had (pad see ew, soups, chicken wings, chili basil, panang) have all been delicious!! The only negatives I have to add are that the portions are just a little small for the price, but it's all incredibly tasty. When I went there last I had the spiked Thai tea, it wasn't all that great I was expecting it to be ultra super amazing since I'm a huge fan of Thai tea. I would definitely be giving Le Thai 5 stars cause the food is awesome, but I'm taking a star away due to the tad but smaller portions than what the price tags suggest..

Definitely would recommend and will be back next time I'm in town.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	WA2zjRnfX_fiH0d8TXSfEw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

My friends like the food here.\n\nThe Thai iced coffee is among the best I've had. My friends like Le Thai's Thai iced tea.\n\nThey have a very good lunch menu in addition to the regular menu. I ordered the Spicy Eggplant -- flavorful with a good variety of vegetables (onions, bell peppers, etc). The dry noodles and tricolor curry was also tasty. \n\nOur server was very friendly and helpful in answering questions we had about the menu. Great customer service.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Ganecsi5u18dg7FXJw2D_A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The food is good, although I would wish for more items in the menu.\n\nOur favorite waitress, Patty, is always fun to talk to.\n\nBe aware though that the place gets busy for lunch! Get there before 11:30am or you will be waiting a while.\n\nThey have a DJ and dancing during First Friday nights.\n\nGood addition to downtown Las Vegas :)	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	maMlVBAwBp1tcO82mh7S6Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

NBiTNHxL6-pyyAtidRmzsw	5	2015-09-08 00:00:00	I am so picky when it comes to Thai food and Le Thai stole my heart! By far, the best Thai food I have ever had! I had the pad-kee-Mao with the Thai fried rice! All I can say is absolutely delicious! I was out in Vegas for the weekend from California and my husband and I were just amazed at the food here. My husband also ordered a Thai soup which was to die for. I wish I could remember the name but I don't :( The place is very small but the decor and ambiance is so cute! It's cozy and modern! Not only is the food amazing but so is the staff! We were seated at the bar because we didn't want to wait and I'm so glad we did! Ashley (I think that's her name)..the bartender was phenomenal! She gave outstanding service! Very polite, friendly and made sure we had everything we needed throughout our lunch! Thank you Ashley & Le Thai for being amazing! This will be my first stop next time I'm in Vegas!

ncfxBPqzCMf18FQcBcr3Rw	4	2012-02-04 00:00:00	For it's location on busy Freemont Street, Le Thai has that 'small-town' eatery feel. Small yet welcoming, you open the door to tables in front of you, and pleasant ambiance. The outdoor seating area in the back is cute, however, it could be more visually appealing. The 'Lady Boy' cocktail was decent, a bit light for the price, but worth trying once. The 'Pork Jerky' appetizer was yummy, and the waterfall sauce is a must try! The 'Awesome Noodles' were indeed awesome, however if you are not one for sprouts, you may want to steer clear as there were more sprouts than actual noodles. The tofu was wonderful, lightly fried and flavored appropriately. The service was moderate, and the food arrived to the table quickly. The place seemed to fill up fast, so an early dinner is best.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	2sC2aGtzBdqZvv1QN4JiwA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
nEQqSxnMdZgUkt1LKByKSQ	4	2016-10-03 00:00:00	Yay, we found another Thai spot we like!  We went early on a Sunday. Like, blue plate special early...right at 4pm (but we had our 4-year-old in tow and none of us had eaten lunch). \n\nThe vibe and atmosphere is very laid back, casual, and fun. They have bistro lighting in the back, so I think it would be a really great informal date night spot. Definitely want to come back with just my husband sometime. \n\nWe got waterfall beef and Thai salad (chicken) to start. That salad was the best Thai salad I've ever had. Our daughter got drunken noodles (shrimp). Then we all shared panang chicken curry and whatever the first beef stir fry option listed is. Everything was super tasty and very, very flavorful. \n\nThe service was great, except you have to box up your own food if you have leftovers (again, because of the vibe we expected this since it's more laid back here).  \n\nI wish they had a few more items to choose from, but I get that the place is small so I'm sure the kitchen is tiny. Love it and already trying to plan a date night for next time.	1	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	W_pPF_bKVNtA8m7lRqdZdw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The beef in it must of been braised or something because it was so tender. My wife ordered the Tom kha gai, the soup was a little thicker then most places which I like because I hate watery soups.

nQIaRvVIQJftocqjz-6bkw	5	2012-06-24 00:00:00	The very first meal of my recent Vegas trip. With many more to come its hard to say any were better than this (and I had some GOOD meals).\n\nWe didnt get any appetizers and as I sit here thousands of miles away I'm regretting it. We did each get the special drink for the day which was a "short" island iced tea for $6. Its was served in a short glass but there was nothing "short" about it. Nice and strong!\n\nI ordered Pad See Ewe and my girlfriend had Pad Thai. Normally Thai places never make anything spicy enough for me. They usually ask for for 1-3 stars or whatever and I always say 4 and its still not that hot. For some reason I had a different feeling about this place and chose a 4 out of 5. It was just perfect for me, hot enough to make my nose run but not too hot to eat. And it was omfg awesome delicious to the point of ruining Thai food for me basically anywhere else. I seriously cant believe how awesome this dish was. \n\nMy girlfriends Pad Thai was equally awesome, she said it was the best she has ever had. She got a level 2 for spice and I found it fairly mild but she likes to add sriracha and it was perfect for her. Everything was cooked just right and tasted extremely fresh. I took a couple of bites and agreed.\n\nHalfway through eating (unfortunately) our waiter brought us a small asortment of condiments. House-pickled jalapenos, house-made thai garlic chili sauce, some dried hot peppers and a bottle of sriracha. The jalapenos and garlic chili sauce were awesome. I wished I had both for my entire meal. \n\nThe service was a little lacking but I'm sticking with five stars because we raved about this meal for the entire night and I'm legitimately upset the damn place is impossible for me to go to anytime soon. Might have to book another trip just to go to Le Thai again.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	bg41jhOxbknzzxgIbWFW1g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

nuz4ZjqRXil2Oz9YcvlE-g	4	2014-10-14 00:00:00	Le Thai, more like Le awesome.\n\nGreat location, great food, and an awesome staff. The portions here are perfect and the flavor will explode your thai tasting brain. \n\nAfter a brief moment of waiting outside my friend and I were brought in and sat at the bar. First thing I noticed, you can see right into the kitchen; the smells coming from it were intoxicating, which turned-up my hunger level to eleven. The decor of the restaurant is a mix of back alley dining with a few standard Thai musings on the wall. I love the vibe of this place... busting, loud and very unassuming. \n\nThe food here is filling and great to have with a group of friends while sipping drinks and telling drunken stories. If you're feeling super chatty and a bit buzzed, might I recommend what I ate, the Ga Pow! \n\nGa Pow is a heavy plate of ground pork (or chicken) with a spicy sauce, chopped veggies, and a big fat fried egg on top. This also comes with a side of white rice, but I opted for brown. This plate of food is more than enough for one eater and could definitely be shared if needed. The meat and veggies were cooked perfect, the pork was still firm and the veggies stayed crisp even though they were swimming in this delightful spicy sauce that I could not get enough of... I mean, hand me straw so I can finish slurping up this savory sensation! The bartender gave me an awesome tip which was to add lemon juice and the dry seasoning at the bar to my meal. I had to fight back the urge to bury my face this bowl. \n\nMy friend and I started with a soup before our main courses showed up, but sadly I can't remember the name! I know it was first on the soup list and we had fried tofu added to it. This was delicious, an amazing flavorful broth with a few hard boiled eggs in it and multiple levels of zesty flavor... this mystery will kill me!\n\nA few notes... \n- When the weather is cooperating, I recommend sitting outside in their back patio area. Clean, spacious, and you really can't beat Vegas weather when it's in the low 80's. \n- If you find yourself waiting outside for a while, just belly up to the window. Yup, there's a little drive-thru window you can walk right up to and order a beer or cocktail and sip with your friends while you wait. Great f**king idea! \n\nPRO-TIP: Check-in and get a squeezable surprise.	8	6	8	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I am also in love with their Chicken Pad Thai and Chicken Massaman. Always ask for the little caddy with different spices and condiments including Sriracha if you're sharing with someone who wants it a little less spicy. I always go in the afternoons, it's not as busy as the nights.

nX8T0S-3TFugqA0wIUjNzw	1	2016-06-10 00:00:00	Our waiter, Darnell, made our experience horrible there. The food was also subpar. We were seated inside the restaurant by a pleasant hostess, who allowed us to have the two seat table near the window. We were seated at 1755, and happy hour ended at 1800. We ordered two regular thai teas and the chicken satay off of the happy hour special at 1759 and took a picture of proof of our order time lol. The special was $2 off of thai tea and $3 off of satay from the regular price of $4 thai tea and $9 satay. We are Filipino. Our waiter was African American, and the couple who was seated several minutes past 1800 were white. Although it was past happy hour, their waiter graciously offered them the happy hour specials. Their happy hour pork special came out before our drinks did. The waiter only brought one tea and I had to ask for the second. He charged us the regular price of $4 for the second drink, by the way. Then he took our order when he returned 5 minutes later with our second thai tea. I hated their tea because it was weak and had the grounds in it. I hate when there are black flecks in my drink. The satay finally came out and was amazing--the only positive part of our experience other than our hostess who sat us. The short rib fried rice was overcooked and tasted like old dog meat. The panang curry vegetables were undercooked (carrots, bell peppers, and bamboo shoots). I nearly choked on the bamboo shoot. We hardly ever saw our waiter, and he took over 15 minutes to bring our check. I had to repeat to him twice that I was clearly done eating  (are used napkins in the curry leftovers not enough of a visual?). My fiancé had time to smoke a cigarette while waiting for the check. I had my purse on and everything and waited another 5 minutes for him to pick up the check, even though I had my card out and was waiting to tell him about the error in the thai tea charge. We decided to pay cash and I gave him a 10 cent tip, plus the 2 bucks I was overcharged. Do not eat here if you are expecting good service and food. If you are white, maybe you may have a better experience than me. Good luck, dine at your own risk. By the way, I'm half white.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	2ZSmGBTkSOxUItP8_xRisg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
NyPaUaqF0jgBfRDnSDBhsw	1	2015-03-20 00:00:00	Do not do it!!!!!!!  We walked in and it smelled great. However, that's where it ended.  The service was non existent and the three times we saw our waitress were for our drink/food order, when she forgot what we had ordered, and when she gave us the check.  \n\nWe ordered the crispy spring rolls as an appetizer.  They came out fairly quick on a lettuce leaf and looked really good.  As I selected one, I noticed the pool of GREASE and OIL that remained on the leave under it.  I cut it in half and more oil spilled out onto the plate.  I used my one napkin to dab what i could from it. The napkin became transparent.  After most of the oil was removed, I finally took a bite. Crunchy, tasteless, greasy, and disappointing.  I dissected the one I had tried and noticed some brown jelly noodles in it that served no purpose.  The other 3  stayed on the plate as I sat hoping the main course would be better.  \n\nThe short rib fried rice level 4 heat\nBland and tasteless pot roast mixed with 2 pieces of onion and some brown cilantro on top of rice.  I ate 3 bites covered in Sriracha before deciding I'll toss it and go get a hotdog elsewhere.  \n\nThe wife's  Chicken Pad Thai level 5 heat\nBasically the same as the fried rice, bland bland bland!  The chicken had a fishy smell and taste to it.  She ate a few bites and decided it was to disgusting to continue. \n\nAnother waiter took our plates and asked if we would like to-go boxes. Both of us quickly said no.  I wouldn't feed that to a dog.  \n\n$40 later and 5 minutes after we leave. Both of our stomachs turn and into the toilet it goes.  I'm praying we don't get food poisoning from this terrible terrible place.\n\nYou can keep your food and your free hug.\n\nUpdate:  We both got E. coli food poisoning.  Ruined the rest of our stay in Vegas as we couldn't be more than 10 feet from a toilet.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	PD89NDu_2ZptUTtnpZgj3w	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

O-TAQ_4g7qD8r2qR8Xm7VQ	1	2013-10-01 00:00:00	Oh Le Thai. I had such high hopes for you. I was hoping my experience would warrant at least a second trip. Alas, twas not meant to be. The problems with my visit began the week before I even arrived. \n\nYou see, I walked by, as I often do as a downtown employee. I thought to myself... "Oh, what I wouldn't give for some delicious Thai yums." When my group and I asked for a reservation, you told us it would be an hour and a half wait. You took my number. You never called. I thought you may have heard about the 3 day rule and confused my spot on the wait list with a date. Anyway, I decided to give you a second chance.\n\nThe following week, I got smart. I thought -- big group -- get a reservation. So I did. Group of 6 at noon. You confirmed the day before and again an hour before. At noon, we arrived. You made us wait outside in the 90+ degree heat for 45 minutes. Then, you only could seat 4 of the 6 of us. You asked us to wait at the table standing until the guests next to us (who had JUST gotten their food) left. Wait, what?! You want me to stare at other guests to intimidate them into leaving because you are terrible at restaurant management? You want them to give us dirty looks when you rush them out of their lunch? Then, when I mention to you that we had a noon reservation you tell me "we are busy." Well, shoot. I didn't know places that were busy didn't have to honor reservations. Wait a second.... you know who else is busy, and in fact, way busier than you -- Lotus of Siam. They honor reservations and their food is incredible. Oh and making us eat our food in the heat outside without misters was super bad form, BTW. \n\nAfter this hellish experience, I at least had hopes for the food, which was sadly mehhh at best. I had a rumbly in my tumbly all afternoon from your food. \n\nSo, Le Thai. I gave you a go. But, I'm breaking up with you. It's not me, it's you. Mediocre food isn't worth a headache. I hope my go-to-Lotus will take me back. But even if it doesn't, I'm still better off without you.	7	1	4	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	6GWe1nKkl0RHO4KXiLlfeQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Ordering something at a level two means it's more spicy than you expect. \nService was lack there of. You order a drink and 20 mins later you have to ask for it again (don't think it was that busy). Our waiter made sure we got what we asked for the second time around. Also it took a longtime for someone to take our food  order. \nSeriously fix the bathroom locks. I kept opening and closing the bathroom to make sure they locked. Finally I gave up  thinking that maybe I'm crazy and it always opens from the inside and got walked in on. Since the place is relatively small it made for an awkward situation . \nThey were however able to split the check onto two credit plus take cash. That was helpful.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	G-MrsYYuBH_mF9oTksEjrg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I loved it!\n\nMy favorite was the pork appetizer with waterfall sauce. The sauce was amazing and the pork was cooked perfectly with a little crispiness to it. My main dish was a ginger beef fried rice. I requested spiciness level 3 and that was good. A decent amount of heat but not overwhelming. My husband had the three color coconut curry with chicken which was also very tasty. \n\nThe portions were large and the price was very reasonable. 4 beers, 2 apps, 2 main dishes for under $60. They have happy hour specials too. The only negative was the lack of indoor space. There is just a few tables and a bar.  The back patio was nice even on a hot day with misters going, nice atmosphere, but I would rather be inside on a hot day eating spicy food.	2	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	dTWh3151qDqnOb_67iGI6w	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The food is consistently great all the time. The staff have been there since the beginning and the pricing is just right.

OcLSVwdyYEb1Aa-Wi4chkw	5	2015-03-31 00:00:00	Once you visit Le Thai in historic downtown, I promise that you will never want to eat Thai Food anywhere else. Chef Dan Coughlin has the magic touch and I've never tasted so much flavor in a dish. Everything on the menu is outstanding but I do have a couple of favorites. Don't order anything until you try the beef jerky with Dan's famous Waterfall Sauce, and for your main entrée, you have to try the Drunkin noodles, three color curry and the Pad Thai. Don't forget when ordering the temperature level that their scale is 1-5 so order extra water if you decide go go with a 5. Enjoy!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	gYM6W2iTae8xi45a72CC6A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

od0AWjAt7oEIM0aVWe7GFg	1	2013-04-03 00:00:00	WOW, I have not been so disappointed in a restaurant in a LONG time.  The other reviews led me to believe that this was THE place to get good Thai in Vegas....and we were dying for good food, given that Vegas Thai and Chinese on Ogden had closed (boo).  \n\nThe wait was two hours...which was spent in the Griffin (see review), so that was fine.  Once seated (outside...it was heated, so that was fine too).  The Tom Ka Gai came out and it was absolutely perfect, so hopes were set high for a great meal.  Sadly, everything else out of the kitchen was just bland dreck.  We ordered every dish Thai native spicy...it came out like baby food.  When we mentioned it to the wait staff, we were told that this is their 'spicy.'  Honestly, it was the blandest, least flavorful mundane crap they could have slung on a plate.  The chicken was dry, the curry was just an overcooked orange mess.  BLECK.\n\nDO NOT buy into the hype - you are better off at Denny's.	2	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	y7QdQmpe5-Z6EDuPt1qu6g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
oDygtRA-pb2WR9xp5Kkl3g	5	2015-03-28 00:00:00	We came here for lunch on the recommendation of the bartender at Banger Brewing. AMAZING Thai food. I was comparing it constantly to my favorite Thai place back home, and was a little bias to my homeland. They blew my Thai joint out of the water. The atmosphere is very cool. We sat "outside" in the back, which is basically a covered back alley with amazing artwork and cute lighting. It felt very trendy to me. But the best part was the food. They don't skimp on spice here... We had the Awesome Noodles with level 3 heat and they were almost spicy enough for my insatiable spicy appetite. I added just a touch of my own spice and was sweaty. Aside from the spice, the flavor is incredible. My only regret is that I did not try the Pad See Ewe. That's my favorite dish back home and now I'm 3000 miles away from Le Thai with no chance of tasting theirs any time soon.  Definitely will be back to Le Thai anytime we are remotely near Vegas!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	6IPd-D-_i9Vw3YcbR4Cg6g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I just watched a line of people wait over 30 minutes while the owner chose to drink at the bar. Is it company policy for your employees to curse at your customers when they ask to eat on the patio? What about following them out as they leave trying to fight them like an immature child. My dog could provide better service. Needless to say, you lost out on  ten customers tonight, and I'll be sure to let every single person I know what I watched happen tonight.	3	0	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	tiWDV5jkt0X6OucxMNTcMA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We were seated in the covered patio out back, which was -- in my opinion -- much better than the inside. I ordered the short rib fried rice (as recommended by Gwyneth Paltrow) and it was by far the best meal at the table, beating the pad Thai and the red and green curry. The highlight of my Las Vegas trip, and I cannot wait to come back to this restaurant.

Or1r1EVi6Qq_0DUJKP2WQA	3	2012-12-19 00:00:00	Where is my server? I struggled with this question for at least 15 minutes after entering. It was packed and they seemed understaffed, so I stuck around even though I would just normally leave. It took them so long to greet me, serve me and give me my check (and three different people dealt with me) that I just left full cash from my gambling money instead of using my card as I wanted to....I did not want to wait anymore. \n\nThe food was...average Thai food. I ordered yellow curry which seemed more like water than like curry. I am used to a thicker pastier curry, or if the curry is thin, it tastes like ingredients, full of flavor, but not like mostly water. I received it mild because I do not like spicy foods so perhaps it was missing some needed taste for that reason.\n\nThe joint itself is very divey, which I should have expected considering that it is on Fremont. I did not like the decor with wooded plank ceilings. It was not cozy at all with all hard chairs and no booths. \n\nNothing great about this place. The $11 curry sounds about right for Thai food but for that price I am usually blown away by other Thai restaurants. I wouldn't return. There is nothing there for me.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	fHOBGmtI1VdGKWIxrFH0kA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

When we came here after our CYME, the place was kinda busy. We had 8 people and the wait would have been 45 minutes, BUT they had 2 separate 4 person tables near each other if we wanted. I was hungry and wanted to eat so we opted for the separate tables. The menu seemed kinda small IMO. I ordered the Le Thai rice dish. Our waitress said it had a lot of veggies but I only noticed some onions and cucumbers. I think it's weird to put cucumbers in a hot dish, but it worked. I got a spicy level 1 (out of 5) and it could have been a touch spicier. But I've learned eating Thai food, every place has it's own level of what they deem "spicy" so I always go with a low #. The portion was generous and the dish was tasty. \nThe have a check in offer on yelp, so make sure you do. It's a free hug! Yep, the waitress (or waiter) will give you a totally free, HUG, just for checking in!\nThe service was good. Our waitress got our food and drinks rather quickly. The food was tasty and well priced.

Back 10 years ago a wealthy THai client of ours took us out on a rare occasion to these back house Thai joints where we supposedly ate the best Thai food. This is one of those back joints with the great Thai food except it is overtly present on Freemont tween 5&6th street. Raggae played while we ate like Thai royalty. You can eat out back open air too - very misty- but twas hot so we ate inside. I think they DJ music at night there too- very happening.Traditional pad Thai, chick skewers, pork jerky lots more... veggie and other healthy tidbit as well. I cant wait to try some more. Yum. Joint is run by cool hip kids (to me anyway).  Very polite. Area is a little crusty but places like Le Thai will eventually replace the luster the area once had. Go there to eat. Super casual reasonably priced. I promised them clients....don't let me down!	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	sChJ4Ffwrx1NwznwGJ9tBw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The host greeted them at the door and sat them, even though we were there first. When he came back, he told us they had no more seats, and there would be a long wait. So we left.

The back patio is particularly nice and does have an "I'm eating in SE Asia" feel (it's a good feeling!).\n\nFor lunch, they have a variety of curries and a few other dishes as specials (comes with rice and a soda). My dining companion and I split a 3 Color Curry with Shrimp and some Chicken Pad Thai. Also got two Thai Iced Teas. The curry, being a lunch special, had a scoop of rice on the bottom. The flavors of the different curries really blended well and complemented the shrimp. The Pad Thai was okay, nothing to write home about. It oddly didn't come with lime, which I usually see with Pad Thai.\n\nFYI the massaman curry is *not* gluten free.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	GYz2-BBolFD5h_D6S5gi3w	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We sat in the front by the bar but the area in the back was really nice and quieter.  Food was spicier than we anticipated but still very good.  We ordered the Chicken Satay appetizer and that was great, better than I expected.  This place is worth a stop if you find yourself off the strip.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	K7Kj__P--LG_2qAUpKWoYQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

ozitBgKTH6dfBX3tPlf57A	5	2015-07-07 00:00:00	One of the BEST casual Thai restaurants I've ever been to. Despite being into downtown Vegas it gives you a very SF/NY chic vibe. Small and understated if it wasn't for the lighted up sign I could have missed it.\n\nInterior: 5 stars! Adorable inside. You basically have two seating options, sit inside at the bar with views of the chefs or make your way back it tropical covered outdoor patio. Patio was lovely for a group but for something more fun I'd love to sit overlooking the kitchen. \n\nService: 4.5 stars; our waitress was lovely and welcoming. Knowing it was our first time she offered great suggestions but also wasn't jumping down our throat. The place was packed on a Monday night so the food took a little while to come out, it really wasn't that bad though but worth mentioning.\n\nFood: 5 stars! Best pad thai I've ever had!!! I'd come again and again for it. Made my meal. Rice is good as well might try a new fried rice next time. The panang curry was "ok" I'm a little spoiled when it comes to panang so while I didn't think it was the best it was still enjoyed by our party. Pricing is also totally reasonable for the amount of food you get. I would highly recommend this spot. Plenty of locals so you know it's good.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	-nlvzH2pSr8mTPahX1YIAA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
ozWp0pA9ze84BAWtqcB0PA	2	2016-12-23 00:00:00	We ordered he simplest of Thai dishes, yellow curry, mainly, to serve as a litmus test.  The chicken was of ordinary quality. The sauce I requested as medium.  It was.  However, the curry sauce was not complex, not nuanced.  Instead, I could basically only detect a chili or spicy taste.  It had a good taste, but the other. typically accompanying tastes weren't there.  Steamed white rice was good.  Eating outside was semi pleasant.  But the ordering through the fast food window, the plastic silverware in the wrapper and zero service all make it less than optimal as an eating experience.  Yes, the help asks for tips in the checks.  By the time we were finished, we spent 20 on a simple Thai dish that was a tad crude and a drink.  Given no service and ordinary food, awkward parking, etc.. I'd pass on this.  There are other Thai restaurants in town with better food and a much nicer ambiance.	0	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	gADzVWGY41IxvU2O8VvK3g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
oZXh3UROcIx_BiPIt7EQRw	5	2016-06-14 00:00:00	I can't believe I have yet to write a review for Le Thai! Seriously...I've been coming here for years and I'm just NOW writing them a review. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this Thai place. Location, service, food and drinks....5 stars to me!!!!\n\nI love that it's in the center of downtown LV. I get to walk around and bar hop during the day, and come eat some bomb ass Thai food afterwards. My most recent visit here was actually during the day with a girlfriend. So of course, we had to take advantage of the happy hour. Ordered a few rounds of their mimosas (me love my mimosa!!!), I had the yellow chicken curry with rice and pork chops with a sweet and sour sauce. We also ordered pad Thai, and cream cheese ragoons. I loved everything we ordered honestly. If you're ever in the mood to try Le Thai though, one thing I would suggest that you MUST get is their Pad Thai. They probably have the best Pad Thai in Vegas, in my opinion. Just watch out for their spice levels....they can get pretty spiiiicy up in there! \n\nHere's a tip: if you check in on Yelp, they give you a free Thai tea! I didn't get to use mine because we were drinking mimosas. But definitely the next time I come, I'm drinking my much deserved Thai tea!	4	3	4	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Hj5TpJNOXqNt62Gbpr5WYw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
P-p5iC-H7lWxRW5JAt71iw	1	2013-05-31 00:00:00	I am in the industry and also am a frequent regular. Tonight my friend and I ordered awesome noodles and pad Thai both level 3. The awesome noodles were perfect but the pad Thai was so spicy it had to been a level 5 there was such a difference between the two. I couldn't even touch the pad Thai without crying. We brought this to the servers attention and he never said sorry or attempted to remake our order or anything. He dropped the bill off and we payed. As we were walking out I noticed one of the owners outside and told her about how disappointed we were in how they reacted to our problem aNd her response was "I'm not he owner just a manger" **lies... But anyway she continued to say "we don't remake orders" I'm sorry you screwed up our order and what? She then continues to say and "sorry the server is new". Ok I don't care if you are new or short staff I am a paying customer and if you f up please attempt to fix the situation not make excuses. Will not be dinning here again. Bad "managers" and wait staff. If you want real Thai food go to lotus of Siam thanks :)	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	nDSwsp0RQKJxK0qh2bgB2A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Both my date and I enjoyed Really good drinks, as well - the bartender there is excellent!  I'm a vegetarian, and there are plenty of options here, no matter your diet (vegan options are also available).  When I ordered the tofu pad thai, the server checked in with me about the fish sauce that it's made with; since I don't eat fish, I was very grateful he asked - not all restaurants are so up front.  Delicious eats!  I definitely plan to return here.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Y76nS3L426UCz7N_1pUfUQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

She double checked that everything came out the way we wanted and made it an all around good time. \nThere is always a wait but it's worth it. Especially when the weather is nice, or in the evening, try to sit on the back patio! It's covered and has heaters for the winter which are VERY warm and the ambience is even nicer. :) definitely one of our favorite restaurants.

PnzkxX5ApJBBLYq88L5Jlw	5	2016-12-07 00:00:00	Another great dinner while visiting Downtown LV. Arrived a little after 6 on a Sunday night. Just having dinner alone so had a seat  at the counter bar in the garden area towards the rear of the restaurant. It was a little cool that night so instead of my usual choice of chicken pad thai, I selected the beef and meatball soup with the chicken wings as an appetizer. The wings came out in about 10 minutes hot and crispy with a side of spicy siracha ranch dipping sauce. The wings were of average size and cooked to perfection. After the wings came a nice size bowl of soup. I chose to have the soup at a level 3 (hot) good choice not over the top spicy hot just the right amount of heat. There was lots of meat in the soup and the spices complimented each other great. After eating all the wings, I could not finish the soup but still ate until I was on the verge of miserable. Have to give this place a try if you want something you most likely don't have back home.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	9HgGmHA16C3rZwnboPnaWA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

PTQxcOdTBQzHI--gtfGbmg	1	2014-03-06 00:00:00	It's sad that once I logged on to leave a review I see the 5 star review I left one year ago for this place. It used to be my favorite until Saturday night. We went for dinner after drinking downtown around 7pm and was told there was a 30min wait and we'll receive a text once our table was ready. We go to a bar to waste time and 45mins later we receive a text so we return. Once we are seated a woman who said she was part owner tells us that the restaurant is "very busy tonight and you'll need to be done within a hour" and she continues to tell us about the table of 14 that's eating and it being a small kitchen. Mind you they weren't slammed. Our waiter takes our order (still no drinks) and it took so long that we had to ask him after 45 mins where it was. We're now sarcastically thinking, "Well does the hour start now since we received our food or what?" We then ask to speak to the manager about the lack of service and the lady comes back over!!! Ugh! We tell her about our experience and remind her of how rude she was to us and she says there's no way she can compensate us in any way. Smh. What's really bad about it is we're locals so when the tourists aren't there who does she think Le Thai is serving?	4	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	VLZJeBCDmNuZ5ZvraLuAOg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

A friend and I came to Le Thai after working in our downtown location for a few hours.  We knew that we had a long night ahead and needed some food in our stomach. Working for Zappos, I was recommended to come here by my CEO and I didn't want to pass the opportunity to do so since we were working next door.  \n\nAt first, you think the place is super small.  The inside consists of a few small tables and a bar area.  Then they take you outside and there are a lot more tables with heaters.  I loved the white xmas lights that set the mood for the dinner experience.  The bathrooms smelled really good and looked like a completely renovated bathroom you would see in a modern house.  \n\nFor dinner, I got the Chicken Pad Thai for $11.50.  My spice level was 2 (remember that they go off a 1-5 scale and not the usual 1-10 heat scale).  The pad Thai was AH-MAZE-ING!  They got served in a big bowl.  The rice noodles weren't as thick as I'm used to and I loved it!  There was a lot of chicken in this dish and the peanuts really enhanced the overall texture.  I must say, this is probably one of the top 5 best Pad Thais that I've experienced here in Vegas.  I certainly think the kind of hefty price is totally worth it.  \n\nDefinitely must come in and try the Pad Thai.  You'll thank me later :-)	7	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
pUl6pZWqWQ6c3iKckn248w	4	2013-02-20 00:00:00	The first in my series of Jury Duty reviews.\n\nI had the pleasure of sitting on a near three week jury selection process recently.  Where do I begin with the downsides of this?  The mind-numbingly dull periods of waiting? The insulting $40 a day pay scale?   The most extreme example of governmental inefficiency I've ever witnessed?   Okay let's skip to the good:  the food!  No I didn't let myself become resigned to eating at Capriottis on the first floor on a daily basis, instead I ventured out into the world unafraid of having to go through the metal detectors a 2nd time, and am I glad I did so!\n\nMy first stop was Le Thai, a place I've been wanting to try for a while now but I simply don't make it downtown enough to have ever made it.   I walked there by myself because early on in the three week process I was my usual socially anxious self.  This could be a plus when going to Le Thai as it is seemingly always crowded.  While I have a perpetually crippling fear of ending up on the tableforone tumblr page, I threw caution to the wind and was pleasantly surprised to find myself at a bar where I might have blended in with the other patrons at the time.   You'll never catch me tableforone!\n\nI ordered the Ga Pow with Chicken which is essentially a Thai Basil dish which is my standard at any Thai restaurant, so it was a no brainer for me to order the lunch special.   I went with a Spice level 3 (out of 5) to play it safe, and had it made out of brown rice (bonus!)   The first real pleasant surprise came in the form of a fried egg that was lovingly placed on top of the entree.  In my book you can't go wrong with a fried egg, and I thought it perfectly complemented the flavors of the Ga Pow.  As for the Ga Pow itself I thought it was extremely tasty and hearty, and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.   I didn't find the spice level 3 to be very spicy in the least, and decided I'd kick it up a notch if I ever returned.\n\nThat happened about a week and a half later, when Le Thai was the first of the downtown restaurants to earn a repeat visit from me.  This time there was a bit more of a wait (even though it was still me by my lonesome), and I again was seated at the bar.   I decided to try the Thai Beef Salad this time to mix it up a bit, and brought the Spice Level up to a 4.  When they brought out my salad I was almost embarrassed by the size.  It looked like something you would get at Claim Jumper.  Even when I started trying to dig in with my fork, pieces from other sides of the plate were spilling off onto the bar.   There's some law of physics that could properly describe this phenomenon, but for now I'll call it the law of "WTF why is there 8 lbs of salad on my plate?"  As far as taste, I enjoyed it, but it wasn't exactly something I'd order again.  The ingredients were fresh, and the individual components were fine, but it was just lacking a certain something when taken as a whole.  Make sense of that, because I can't.   Oh yeah, it was also too spicy to me.  This is again why I hate the scale of 5.  3 isn't spicy enough, and 4 is too much.   7 out of 10 is perfect, I can't translate it any other way.  \n\nI've seen some service complaints, but both times I was served by the same gentleman at the bar and service was fast and friendly so no complaints there.  \n\nPrices were pretty much in line with other Thai restaurant experiences, maybe slightly higher.\n\nAfter more visits and sticking to dishes that revolve around rice, egg, and not veggie intensive, I could see myself bumping it up to a 5 eventually.  For now Le Thai will have to settle with Le Four.	1	2	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We were sat outside and we ordered crispy spring rolls to start and they were really crispy with great flavor. I had the flat noodles with chicken at level 3 spicy and my aunt did the same with no spice and we both loved it. The portions were so large that we both ended up taking home at least half our dishes.

Even though I never bothered to check ...but I'm glad I finally did! \n\nLe Thai a tiny Thai place sits on this road with a bright sign that is hard to miss. The food was yummy especially if you have a late night craving for spice. I had their specialty short rib fried rice. I was thinking that the short ribs were served on the side but it was actually little bits of rib meat in the rice. It was delicious! I also couldn't resist the fried spring rolls to go along with my meal. \n\nIt's a cute place. We sat in the patio which was a little warm but it was a cozy spot. The seating inside was also small but it wasn't too crowded since we came into eat after midnight.

Q1nIPQyjOAn63uws0UMfSg	5	2012-01-07 00:00:00	Best Pad Thai I've ever had - and unlike any other version you're used to. No wonder Keri Simon made the chef make it in front of him. \n\nLarb salad was also great, but should come with a disclaimer. After a few bites, its like napalm for your tastebuds and you won't be tasting anything else for the next three hours. So, do not get it along with another entree - you won't be able to tell the two apart. Bottom line: Larb is an either or situation.\n\nThe food is outstanding. For this, you will have to put up with sparse, metered parking, very slow service, spotty guest wi-fi that kicks you off every 30 seconds (in case you care about connectivity at this point). One little oddity is that when you walk in, you're immediately surrounded by tables and other dining customers. Close quarters. There is no hostess welcome/wait area. And when you arrive, no one pays you the attention to either seat you or tell you what's up - like where to wait or how long of a wait it will be. You walk in and hope you get a server's attention who may or may not seat you in the next 5-10 minutes. \n\nDo go on a nice sunny day - they have a beautiful, relaxing back patio area where you can enjoy a great meal in a nice, open environment. Inside is a bit cramped... but did I mention that they serve THE BEST PAD THAI EVER!!? ;) \n\n*2-star = freaking SPICY!! Next time... no star, so I can taste more of their amazingness and not be sniffling through my entire meal.	1	0	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	7Pxx2FehELyKthPj0OY1sg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It's the go to dinner spot downtown now and often times i suggest it to people when they are looking for a bite to eat.  The food is good, no complaints but it isn't the holy grail of Thai food that people make this place out to be. If it wasn't in the location it is - I don't think people would be so keen on the reviews or continue to patronize it repeatedly. The location and vibe is great - but it's the organic vibe of the place that makes it - not the staff that creates it. The wait staff is not the friendliest or personable and management - whoa sister better not let the success go to her head.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	P5zo78XMAvQrJys4b5N5PA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

All were kick butt good. We went for 5 on the heat usually 5 of 5 is cool this was serious fire while not destroying the taste the heat lived with the subtlety still there. The pad was not too saucy and had plenty of substance over sauce. The one challenge of the night was the service our original waitress ditched us as work was too heavy for her but the dude in the dread locks took us from her and provided excellent service.

qCbswVwZDjiMs1bL63s1sA	3	2012-10-22 00:00:00	Food came out lightning quick...Old Downtown Las Vegas has been sprouting out cool little spots the last year or so, Le Thai is an addition that covers the late night eatery question when you are partied out.  I for one came in during lunch and tried the Waterfall Beef.  It can get pretty sporty during lunch, so beat the rush or get ready to put in some work to get a seat.  Anyweezy, I didn't want to try the same old stuff everyone orders (pad thai, panang, etc.) and decided to try something new.  The beef was cooked a little well for my taste, but was surprised how tender it was still.  \n\nThe second time I rolled through, I got lucky with finding a seat at the counter outside...luckily it is cooling down in vegas, otherwise I would advise against it.  However, this time the food took forever to come out and this time I did get the panang at level 4 of 5 spice.  It took about 25 minutes for it to come out, so try to come before or after the rush.  Once it came out, I was not sure how accurate the spice level was, but after a few bites, I noticed that it was true to scale.  Level 4 is perfect for those that like it spicy, but still wants to retain feeling in your tongue following the meal.  Level 5 would probably be too much.  Mind you, I got some stones when it comes to heat, so my account may vary for some, remember, you can always add more peppers, but you can't take em out, so play it safe at first. \n\nInterior design is hip and tailored for the downtown crowd.  It is sort of filling up with yuppies and business folk nearby, but the place is still new and in its infancy and may settle down with an established crowd identity later down the road.\n\nOtherewise, not bad...not quite authentic Thai food, but seems to fool a lot of people and mixes it up with a diverse menu that could get beefed up a bit.  But its the only Thai place near work and makes it a very convenient eatery spot.	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

QfCxz46KcTAhLgDsvlwZ-w	4	2016-12-18 00:00:00	I was torn whether to give this place 4 or 5 stars. Here's what I would give 5 stars: our appetizer, the spring rolls, were maybe the best I've ever had. Really really delicious. Service was great as well. What I would give 4 stars: our main course. Both my husband & I ordered Awesome Noodle dish. It was tasty. Not the #1 best Thai I've ever had, but definitely yummy. Here's my one critique: the dish was very monochromatic. It was all brown, no color from veggies or anything. It was a bit off-putting. The taste was much better than I expected from looking at the dish. Just some carrot slivers or peppers would go a long way towards making the dish look as yummy as it tasted! I'd definitely go back here though, it was a good experience all around.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	p4FnXuRINsQ7BrICxfmFtw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

QlUHf1_4i7sZjOzrJyv7Xg	4	2017-03-05 00:00:00	One of my favorite places to get food in Vegas! I love this place for their short rib fried rice. Honestly you can get good curry many other places as well, but this is the only place that can do the short rib fried rice the way they do. It's a little pricey at $14, but it's a really good serving size. I'm pretty petite and get full after eating half, so it makes for amazing leftovers for the next meal! Only con would be how busy it gets, and how difficult parking in the Fremont area can be. I haven't actually dined in, in a while because of how long the wait usually is.

They've got a world-class version, but I would suggest trying the Awesome Noodles if you haven't had 'em yet.

But when you're scarfing down delectable goodness, you forget all about the waiter that took 10 minutes to get your drink order.

Once was when they first opened. I had their Flat Noodle Salad and their Drunken Noodles.\n\nFlat Noodle Salad: Very delicious, flavorful, salad was dressed well and meat was okay\n\nDrunken Noodles: Overdone noodles with an on-the-blander side sauce\n\nThe next time, I went in for their lunch special. Their lunch special was okay. It includes a soda or tea. \n\nWe chose the \n\nThree-Color Curry: all the curries were mixed together, so it was really only one curry color, yellow or light orange. The chicken was really dry, but it's because they don't really do anything to the meat. Perhaps it would be helpful to marinate the meat in prep, so that there would be flavor infused into the meat. \n\nSpicy Eggplant: The pieces of eggplant were cut into big chunks, and as such, were not able to absorb the flavorful sauce that they came with. The sauce was really delicious and went very well with the rice. I chose beef for this dish. The beef was better than the chicken in terms of moisture. \n\nService is okay. Ambience is great. Music is awesome. Outdoor patio area is a plus. I just wish that the food was a bit better. I will be back to try their toms one more time. Until then, Le Thai is...

We went the other day and I tried the green curry for the very first time.. I could not believe I have been missing out on this for so long, it was some of the best tasting curry I've ever had and served with deliciously steamed brown basmati rice. The waterfall beef was as delicious as it ever has been, the sticky rice is always just perfectly done, and the Thai iced teas are never too sweet but always a little decadent! I cannot explain how much I absolutely love this place being only blocks from my home!	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	P35whJ9z0__HUjfSrRmIww	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The food is good and the drinks are stiff. \n\nThe menu has most of the usual dishes one would find in a thai restaurant but there was one which stood out - short rib fried rice. Glad we noticed. The pad kee mow with shrimp had fresh shrimp and the chicken satay had tender chicken and grilled to perfection. Overall had a very satisfying dinner.\n\nThe staff are friendly and the drinks come out soon.	1	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	XIDHp_Bs__wKRbPyXcghLQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
QWZgPOgsEw_GUAMP9qo7hA	5	2016-09-14 00:00:00	Best Thai ever! We understood there was always a wait so we called...they told us they could put us on the list to get there in 45 minutes, perfect! We sat out back in about 95 degree weather under the misters, also perfect!! Lunch specials for $9.95, hell yes!  Amazing green curry but then I tried my husbands 3 color curry, holy moly!! The flavor of that dish is out of this world and I can't wait for my next trip to Vegas to RUN directly here for the 3 color curry! As a tourist, downtown is the best and this place is one of the reasons!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	rGj1n4d8fpnaimRruOujhw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

QYylzFdz4WU4q6mO7qwCtg	4	2012-12-08 00:00:00	We sort of stumbled upon this place because we were checking out Heart Attack Grill, and well...let's just say gorging on cholesterol and fat wasn't our idea of lunch.\n\nWe came during happy hour (3-6pm) and ordered all 4 appetizers off the menu.\n\nFirst off, for the price  ($5-7 each plate), the portions are dinner size, which is a huge plus.\n\nThe wings were pretty good...loved the sriracha dipping sauce.  \n\nThe waterfall beef was a tad underwhelming because it was just sauteed slices of beef, but the seasoning was spot on and the waterfall sauce was good.\n\nThe pork jerky was just as advertised...jerky.  Texture was good for what it was...same waterfall sauce as the beef.  If you're not a fan of jerky...don't order it.  \n\nChicken satay lacked any seasoning.  Peanut sauce was standard.\n\nWe had read previous yelp reviews on the awesome noodles, and chose to order it to see what the hype was about.  But alas, our server forgot to put the order in and we canceled it because it never got started.  -1 star.  \n\nSo far, pretty good considering the speed of service, friendly staff, quaint vibe, and tasty food.  Would definitely come back next time I'm in downtown Vegas.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	BxARkkmEViMDHDVddUDX0A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
qY_aNwKJQIsSRyAyLWVxpg	4	2014-11-12 00:00:00	The food here is outstanding! It's a cute little venue right on Fremont St, and I love eating my lunch here. \n\nThe seating is pretty limited, and last time we went, we had to eat out on the patio. It had a fun, intimate atmosphere, and the lighting was beautiful. It was quite warm outside and, despite the misters, I felt like I was melting. Now honestly, this could have been a combination of the weather and the spice-level 4 food that I got, so I'm fine with that. I just wish there was a little more indoor seating, but the venue doesn't really allow for that. \n\nThe waiter up-sold us on a beer that was overpriced, and not the most tasty, but the food more than made up for it. Will definitely be a repeat customer for a long time!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Q1s8saWck0a5pGbi4Xe0cA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
qZkT44fr8sBlhF7ehC1ZbQ	3	2014-05-03 00:00:00	The main thing is it's cool to have a local place to eat downtown that's not in a casino. \nOther than that, it's overpriced ($12-15 for traditional Thai entrees), and the food is solid, but not special. \nI like what they did with the back patio - the good things about sitting outside without the ugly view of nearby buildings and air conditioners. The front patio is kinda lame since they just put tables outside, literally right on Fremont. \nMy main complaint is the seating. We weeee originally seated at a bar top, only it doesn't look at a bar, it looks at a wall. Plus the dishwasher or something is on the other side, so the bar shakes like crazy. Constantly. Luckily, they honored our request to move to a table because it seems pretty annoying to have to eat there!\nProbably won't be back...too many other options!	0	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Maybe start hiring some people. The economy sucks and people need jobs. Lame. I wish their food wasn't decent. Plus the first time I went there the waiter told my girlfriend that "hot" would be too hot for her.

However, the other Yelpers were correct, this place is great! I got the ga pow with chicken and it tasted DELICIOUS! Checked in for the free ice coffee which was also really good! My friend got one of the curries and again, excellent. Don't pass this place up when you're in DTLV, its a great little Thai place.

R-Fj4mJ87kN_rCAvQYJs-Q	2	2015-07-30 00:00:00	This spot is lauded as one of Vegas' best Thai restaurants, really? My experience was average, bordering on dismal. The menu mostly consists of classic dishes, priced on par with other Fremont St businesses. Unfortunately, the flavors aren't there. \n\nTRI COLOR CURRY: Tasted like a panang with extra veggies thrown in. Chicken in the dish was minimal. Curry was very creamy, but ordering a 3/5 was considerably more mild than expected. I do appreciate that brown rice is available without a surcharge. Portion was ample for lunch. \nPAPAYA SALAD: $10 for a salad without any protein or flavor. Lots of shredded papaya, but the clearly-frozen-from-a-bag green beans were a complete turn off. The dressing lacked the acidity and pop to make it add anything other than moisture to the salad itself. \n\nI did not experience the service issues that others mention, but didn't see our server much to begin with. I was a little put off by their lack of a public bathroom?*- guess it's lucky I didn't get my curry as hot as I'd wanted, which would have made my guzzle down more water. \n\nProps for having bottles of San Miguel available, and the various outdoor seating areas with misters are a nice touch. But I've had better Thai from takeout spots that are half the price.\n\n*EDIT: I've been corrected that there is indeed a bathroom here, apparently it's outside? Perhaps the exterior signage should say "bathrooms for customers only" for clarity, as the sign was my only cue given that my server was only around for the ordering and check and we dined inside where no possible bathroom door existed.	10	7	5	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
r-XYyxa_9lp4ZWthxW_gyA	5	2017-05-26 00:00:00	I booked Le Thai for my wedding reception in February. We rented out the entire restaurant for a few hours and it was a really wonderful experience. The assistant manager, Dino, worked with me in advance via email to set everything up. I did have a bit of panic in advance because he wasn't as quick to respond to email as I would have expected, but everything worked out in the end and it was a great experience. My guests all LOVED the food, and the restaurant buy-out included wine, beer and a couple of pitchers of sangria, all of which was great for us. Dino and the servers were all really wonderful, and made the entire occasion totally seamless. I was nervous that the outdoor space might have been a bit cold in February but no way, it was covered from drizzle and had plenty of heaters to keep us cozy.

R4OH654J6W9Jk7mfnzqN5A	1	2015-12-29 00:00:00	Again, one star, just so I can post this.  Called ahead per Le Thai instructions.  "Please arrive in 45 minutes" per hostess 12/27/2015.  Arrived 35 minutes later. The Hostess, after sending her emergency text messages and clearly pretending to be busy, indicates that there will be an additional 35 minute wait for our table, a party of seven.  \n\nWe are locals and have been going to Le Thai for years, this is a typical situation.  We arrived to learn we will need to wait an additional 35 minutes, outside in 30 degree weather, while they slowly and methodically move two of the Ten empty tables together to accommodate us.  This makes a total wait time of 1hour and 20 minutes. Listen folks, this was a Sunday night!!!\n\nI am disgusted and insulted by the treatment at Le Thai.  This is no way to operate a business. I do not plan to patronize this establishment ever again. \n\nThere are plenty of good Thai restaurants in Vegas, Save the aggravation and head around the corner to La Comida, where you at least someone will make and effort to serve you food and drinks on the same day your arrived.  \n\nShame on Le Thai and it's management.	2	2	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	MG30YJ-5j4lseWIshPZYrA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

My daughter attend mama school close by so dining there after her activities is easy. So I go, our sever was terrible. We had to flag her dog each time we needed something... definitely looked understaffed. \n\nToday!! Wow go place a take out order (I refuse to dine in any longer) took me 20min on hold!!! Just to place the order. When o did place the order the bartender was so short, he practically hung up on me... no joke... didn't even say "BYE!l I get there ... my name was wrong... took 5 min to figure out which one was my order... no apologies... nothing. \n\nThey have people waiting outside... why would they care about service????	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	fxqgwFfKHA7LipPCg1sU2Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

But if you come knowing you're going to get a nice home cooked Thai meal with a simple cozy atmosphere, you will be pleased. We were seated outside for dinner, and they had water sprayers that misted the air to cool you down, so I think the temperature was better than inside.\n\nMy food was spicy (I'm a whimp) but delicious. We had a grande old time talking to a family seated next to us.

I took a friend there for lunch and faced the kitchen which is open to view all the cooks, without effort. From the time we sat down, I watched two of the cooks (lady and man) eat as they prepared the food. Nonstop!  With their hands, glove and all. I thought at first the lady was having her lunch to the side and didn't touch the food. I was wrong. My friend, who is very picky about where she eats, was starving and so was I. I should have gotten up but didn't. Well as luck would have it, the lady slides over to help prepare the food. Never did she change a glove.

After 20 minutes I checked back to see how much longer and was told she didn't know.  Ok fair enough we were just hungry.  \n\nOnce we were seated after about a 25 minute wait, our table was right on top of tables next to us.  If you want to sit inside, be warned it is a very small space.   The waiter came to take our order, we placed an appetizer order right away with drinks and then the waiter disappeared for like 20 minutes, avoiding eye contact with us.  We got a hold of the hostess who said I'm not you waiter.  LOL  Just wow, I still can't believe how terrible the hostess behaved.  \n\nWe had our appetizers and left.

RK5ijsrMXp8JVN5jYEXbJQ	1	2014-04-27 00:00:00	I have eaten here once in the past and had a fine experience.\n\nWhen my fiance requested that a large group of our friends get together for his birthday for dinner here, I was more than happy to make a reservation. Unfortunately, after the initial reservation I have experienced nothing but problems. I made a reservation three days before, as our party was larger and we wanted to be there on a Saturday night. When making the reservation I waited on hold for a few minutes, but made the reservation easily.\n\nTwo days later I called back to add one more to our party, and was told that we could not be accommodated at the time that I had made the reservation (6:30). I was told that we would need to move our reservation back a half an hour (at least) and that our group would have to be seated at two separate tables. The hostess apologized, and I proceeded to call the half dozen people that had agreed to join us to inform them of the different time. I was already fairly upset, but figured that I should have paid better attention to the yelp reviews that stated the hosting staff had a hard time doing their jobs. \n\nFive minutes before we are about to leave for our new 6:00 pm reservation, I get a call from the same hostess at Le Thai telling us that she has to move our reservation back to the original time! Unbelievable! She said that previous reservations had come in late, so now our table would not be ready (even though she had told me several times over the phone that if we weren't there exactly at 6:00 she would be giving our table away). Absolutely ridiculous. So I now had to, again, scramble to call a bunch of people and apologize for them changing the time! I figured that I would utilize the time waiting to write a yelp review warning others; do not bring a large party to Le Thai. What should have been an enjoyable, low-key birthday celebration instead was turned into a major headache. If we hadn't had a bunch of people planning on getting dinner here with us (and if we had time to make a reservation somewhere else) we would have just cancelled. We will definitely not be back.	3	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	n-Hit0Y3O6FxTiEhdEEsZw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
rkJstwVq_omBO3l34s6Ipw	3	2017-05-08 00:00:00	Le Thai is good. I'm not head over heals for it, but it did the job. I'm also extremely biased given the fact I have a favorite thai place in NYC that I compare every other thai place too. The ambiance at Le Thai was dope. Super chill and relaxed. The wait on a Tuesday night was an hour and a half. That could possibly be because the venue is rather small. The service was a little sketch. I was dining with 2 other coworkers and they were half way done with their food when I began to grow impatient with the fact my meal had no come out yet (it was a mix between being hangry, a little tipsy and jet lagged.) I ordered the chicken pad see eww and spring rolls. The portions are HUGE and even for me -- someone who is obsessed with pad see eww, I ended up taking a pretty big chunk of it home. I would give Le Thai another try the next time I'm in Vegas. I'm not going to kick it out the running just yet.	2	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	wzpxvQsRsPbsjPIOiogXzQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I am not a fan of peanut sauce, but I couldn't get enough of their sauce!  \nFor entrees, we ordered the short rib fried rice off the specials board, and the meatball and beef soup.  Their spicy scale goes from1-5.  We ordered the soup 3 and the rice 2.  The rice was very tasty and had a bit of a kick to it.  The soup was delicious!  Level 3 spicy was enough to have us reaching for the iced tea quite a few times until we got used to it.  \nThe service was just ok, but we will definately be back for more soup and to try some noodle dishes.	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	MpV4QvAmbYdw_oPEgIavxw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

You have servers who know exactly what is vegetarian-friendly and I don't ever feel like I might be getting accidently served fishes in my food.  Your spice levels aren't for the faint of heart.  When can we meet again?\n\nI've been here twice, once on a busy Tuesday evening and once on a not-so-busy-because-we-are-trying-to-close Saturday around 1 a.m.  I may or may not have been drinking lots of wine before my second trip to Le Thai.\n\nBoth times we ordered the same thing: Thai tea, Awesome noodles, and Massamam curry.  Thai tea: not cheapy tasting tea like I've had elsewhere and with just the right amount of sweetness.  Awesome noodles: lots of fresh veggies and a slightly sweet sauce, the noodles are wide and perfectly cooked, and the noodles are balanced perfectly with the right amount of veggies.  Massamam curry: tons of flavor and spice and served with a healthy serving of steamed rice.  This is the only curry they can make vegan.  I've had it with tofu the first time and just veggies the second- I prefer veggies only.\n\nJust a heads up, they showed me their heat scale for when you order.  "Medium" (which is what I always order) is a 2 on a scale of 5.  I would assume Medium would be a 3, but not here.  And Le Thai's Medium is almost too hot for me.  If you aren't into spicy food, order as low as they can go.\n\nThe menu is small, but they do it all right and that's all that matters.	4	1	5	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Went before a show at the smith center and they made sure to get us out in time to get to the show before curtain.  I appreciated the decor of the place the most.  Very urban.  The waitress was a little unhelpful when we were placing out order but still highly recommended and worth a visit.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	7G8w2SnaC-qDVQ7_GqTxMg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
rv0X60srqTjHHxUeo8BGyg	5	2014-07-15 00:00:00	Le Thai completely exceeded my expectations. It's smack dab in the middle of  Fremont so I couldn't imagine dining here on a Friday or Saturday night but I came here on a weekday afternoon and it was spectacular! I was a little skeptical at first simply based off of the the small size of the restaurant (the outside patio area is huge!) The misters did a great job at keeping us cool. \n\nFor starters, our server, Trelysa greeted us immediately with water and let us know the happy hour specials. We ordered the Larb Salad and the Pad See Ewe. Both were bursting with flavor and the portions were just right. \n\nWhen dining out, I'm a huge advocate of receiving a great service. Rarely ever even in Vegas where it is a Hospitality hub) does this happen. Le Thai thrives in both food and service. Can't wait to come back and try the other items on the menu!	3	2	5	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	7Q6nBHl6NJ9gbJ900FkkAg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

If your looking for a hole in the wall best Thai restaurant in downtown Vegas Le Thai is the place to eat. \n\nOrdered Thaijito which by the way is there specialty (strong Ass Drink) and 3 curry blend with white rice.

rYwg0x849eu4quCfDD9hpA	1	2014-03-05 00:00:00	Yikes!\n\nMy best friend said that she wanted to eat thai food Downtown before we started our night.. so onto my phone I went and Le Thai in East Fremont seemed to get a nod of approval. It ended up being a 45 minute wait and good thing they had that nifty app to text you when your table is ready because we went exploring. If you know in advance that you will be eating here.. I suggest making a reservation. \n\nWe got seated at the bar and service was exceptionally slow for being seated right in front. It took another 15 mins to get drinks and 45 mins for our food to come out. \n\nCrab Rangoon: Was there even any crab in this? It tasted like I was just eating cream cheese wrapped inside of a fried won ton. \n\nPad See Ewe: My favorite thing to order at Thai restaurants and they butchered it. It came out dark (burnt) and I couldn't even bother eating it after a few bites. \n\nPad Thai: Just no. Noodles were overcooked and ended up being flavorless overall. \n\nThe good? My friend loved her Lucky Buddha beer for $5.	10	7	4	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	E5xx_Z_kMAlzbIS72zY8Hw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
S3SLW0Ls-dQcrmGfqI1Nnw	1	2017-03-24 00:00:00	Never have I left a restaurant without leaving a tip, even when receiving sub-par service. But tonight was a 1st and I worked many years in the service industry. It was really bad! I gave 1 stars for the food as it was average Thai food and the restaurant had a cool vibe. From the beginning the server seemed uninterested in serving us, maybe because we all ordered water and not liquor (idk). She asked us if we saw the specials that were posted in the front (we did not), she told us what the specials were but could not provide prices. Not sure why? They were supposed to be SPECIALS. Non the less we ordered off the regular menu as it seemed too difficult for her. Food took about 1/2 an hour, appetizer took about 20mins (which we had to initiate). We ate and enjoyed conversation for a while, we realized no one had been around to take plates away or check up on us in sometime. Finally the server comes over with the check in hand and says she is going on break and we can cash out with so&so when we are ready. But my daughter wanted desert and we wanted to pack up the left overs. She said she would put in the dessert before her break and be right back with the check and to go boxes. She brought back the check but no the boxes. We had to waive down the other server for the boxes. And then we waited and waited and waited, the table next to us ordered and received their food before we got our dessert. Actually our dessert never came until we were standing by the bar to get cashed out because no one ever came to do that either. The dessert came out as we were standing there, by that time I was extremely annoyed and said to the runner who brought it out that we ordered that like 40 minutes ago. I wasn't going to send it back as my daughter was already bummed thinking we were going to leave without it, so the runner packed it up quickly while someone else was cashing us out. We live in Henderson, so to come all the way downtown for bad service doesn't make me want to come back for any restaurants. I do have my go to Thai place closer to us, but I like to support the downtown community. Not feeling like it anymore.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	kYU7yY8UDCvJQZSNi9cU_A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

A little cramped, but doable.\n\nReally good food, but it is worth noting that it is more downtown hipster than authentic Thai food.

SiZlsTNNcw8GlqpUtgEO6A	4	2015-08-12 00:00:00	I came here for dinner on Friday night after spending the day at the pool at Downtown Grand. I've heard so many good things that I feel bad about waiting this long to actually try this place out!\n\nThere was a little bit of a wait since it's a smaller venue and it was a Friday night so we went next door to Commonwealth for drinks while we waited. This made the wait go by fast and they text you when the order is ready which is really helpful.\n\nI went with two of my friends and we each ordered our own dish but we all tried each others. I decided to order the drunken noodles based off the recommendation of the waitress. They were amazing! I would recommend this dish out of all I tried. They were tasty and just the right amount of spicy (I think I ordered a 3 out of 5). My other friend order the yellow beef curry and he ordered a 4 out of 5 in the spiciness and it was wayyy to spicy and I could barely eat it because it was just too spicy for me. It also caused a little heart burn for me after. For me 3/5 spicy is perfect. \n\nThe prices weren't too bad and the service was good. I just recommend getting here early if you don't want to wait too long because it is a popular place to dine in DT LV.\n\nPS** Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get your free beer coozie! :)	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	eh9uc8xHYR9-rki7fWggQQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

smfJ-FC5iokX7AbGbTMD4Q	3	2017-03-22 00:00:00	I REALLY wanted to like this place. A lot of my friends have mentioned this restaurant and stated how much they enjoyed the food so my boyfriend and I decided to stop by last weekend. First off, they have an amazing staff. Very nice and accommodating. The hostess was great and our server was on top of everything. We really appreciated him informing us that he was going on break and to let the other server know if we needed anything, to just ask. However, we never saw anyone for the last 20 minutes that we were there. They were very busy so we decided not to stay any longer and just walked up to someone at the bar and asked for assistance.\n\nThe food..... what can I say... the chicken satay was amazing and I loved the peanut sauce. I ordered the panang curry and my bf ordered the yellow curry (I think).... we love the flavor, but I was disappointed at the amount of chicken they put (which was barely any at all) in the generous bowl of curry they served it with. It was mainly vegetables and I had to fish for the tiny pieces of chicken hoping there was more at the bottom. I hate to do this, but I have to stress how VERY little meat there was in there :(  A few minutes later our pad Thai arrived. The noodles were completely white and the entire dish basically tasted like noodles with lime juice & veggies. Where's the rest of the sauce?!?! The only reason I gave three stars is because I liked the staff and the atmosphere. I don't think I'll be coming back unless one of my friends who love this place really wants to go.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Yy_iGXxLpL6tYDQoE-6XVg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

SNR141kV4DLMqGnAa6HzpQ	5	2014-11-19 00:00:00	A few years ago I would not have even thought about eating in downtown Las Vegas's Freemont East but they have really cleaned the place up recently and so I decided to go ahead a give Le Thai a try due to all the great reviews on Yelp. I can happily (and hungrily) say that the reviews are correct. This place is some kinda wonderful. I've never been to Thailand but If I ever go I hope all the food is this good. First I started off with the Thai Iced Tea....I never knew Ice Tea could be this good. It was cooling, creamy (coconut milk maybe?) and refreshing and was the perfect beverage to my spicy foods.  Le Thai is small and dark, but it gives off a cool vibe, kinda like your sitting in a secret room that nobody else knows about, except that the whole city of Vegas seemed to be eating there the night we went. While drinking our drinks and eating our meal we literally were staring at a wall because the bar in front of the wall was the only place to sit.  For an appetizer we started with pork jerky and sticky rice. I'm not sure what the sticky rice was for but the pork was pretty amazing.  It was lightly seasoned and then fried into chunks and was served with something called waterfall sauce. I'm not sure where the waterfall was but it was some good tasting water that was coming from it. My wife and I scarfed it all down. Because we gorged ourselves on fried pork the wife thought it best to have something lite for her entrée choice and went with a papaya salad. She had a choice of heat level (1-5) and decided on one which was probably a good choice because it was just spicy enough for her. The salad was really tasty. The Papaya was thinly shredded and reminded me of a rice noodle. Chunks of carrots, tomatoes, and some other veggies were tossed with a Thai Chilli Lime Sauce and it was a very refreshing and light tasting meal.  I went the opposite direction with my meal and decided to go heavy and rich with a Beef Short Rib Fried Rice topped of with a over easy fried egg. I am so glad I did because it was pretty amazing tasting.  The beef was shredded then mixed into the onion and cilantro laced Fried Rice. With the yolk of the egg mixed into it was just delicious on all levels. It was also very spicy even though I only went with a three on the heat scale. Those Thai folks definitely like the spice. Heartburn be damned.....I finished off the entire bowl and washed down an antacid with another Ice Tea.  This was a pretty amazing meal and some of the best Thai Food I have ever had anywhere.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
SOB1pAD5euiEw_h2AGWZYA	4	2013-01-22 00:00:00	Great Thai restaurant for being where it is!  I would never have thought!\n\nMy co-workers and I were in the middle of a brainstorming session that we didn't want to interrupt, so it was perfect for us to call in our order, then pick it up 30 minutes later.  We ordered more than enough food for 4 adults:\n\n-Tom Yum Soup with Chicken\n-Pad Thai with Chicken\n-Pad See Ewe with Pork\n-Red Curry with Tofu\n-Spicy Eggplant with Beef\n\nNote: Stir-Fry and Curry dishes come with rice.  We didn't realize that, so we made rice at the apartment.\n\nWe ordered dishes with a variety of spice levels: 2 and 3. I eat spicy (i mean REALLY SPICY), so the Level 3 - Hot, was just normal spice to me.\n\nWhen we went to pickup the food, service was great!  The staff was incredibly friendly!  Not only did they give us plastic utensils (as most take out places do), but they even gave us paper plates! (Believe me, the little things matter the most).	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Q0qo1Gi99LihNjitnpfCAw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

My only complaint is that the people who takes reservation or the one in front needs attitude adjustment. I know you guys are busy but as a client I just want to be treated better. We were greeted by this guy and  he asked for our number so they could call us when our reservation was ready. He was different not polite and when I ask about something he seemed annoyed I really felt that he didn't care if we came back for our reservation .  Specially when it's hot , it's hard to wait outside . A smile with be awesome.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	mvrkMx4I9CzS4VwzznhLSw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

There is indoor and outdoor seating, and the outdoor seating is covered. It was chilly when we went so we sat inside. Everyone has been raving about this place to me so of course we had to try it. We went for happy hour which was great because we got to try a few things for much cheaper. We sat and had beers and we first tried the Thai BBQ Wings which were AWESOME. They have this amazing sriracha chili ranch dip, WOW! I loved them. Then we tried the chicken skewers which came with a peanut sauce, they were also awesome, but the sriracha ranch was SO good I kept it to dip the chicken skewers in! To finish off the evening we tried the chicken panang curry, which is our favorite thai dish and it was good. It wasn't the BEST curry I have ever had but I liked it. I would definitely recommend this place, but make a reservation beforehand. Since we went so early we didn't have to wait, but I have been told to make a reservation because the place gets packed. Considering they had a ton of employees, I assume this is true. ENJOY!!!!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	mRD8eF_TkCZFqsvrBrHbHg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We had level 3 and 4 of spiciness and my indian friend was not surprised with level 4, but level 3 was too much for our average american friend. \n\nThe best thing I remember is that I never have had food that came SOOO hot temperature wise. Usually they serve you and it goes cold pretty fast, not here. Plates are the melamine plastic ones, which I usually refuse with hot meals. Maybe one day they'll get ceramic ones.	2	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	6CbNnrhmjcGLX_FM1vvVrg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The wait wasn't that long, we got our food pretty quick considering it was Valentine's Day when we came here. (Sorry for my late Yelp review). We ordered this amazing curry, forgot what it was called but it was a great balanced mixture of the yellow, red and green curry. Mmmmmmmmm, that curry is beyond amazing, makes me drool just thinking about it. Everything we ordered was amazing. Would love to visit her again, soon.

sXP7MqKoxym6BPWclv6H0Q	2	2012-11-25 00:00:00	Le Thai has good food but due to the crowdedness and a bad experience with unfriendly staff and three food mix-ups in a row (including the same dish, twice), I stick to take-out. However, now I am not sure when I'll be able to even get take-out again!\n\nWe've ordered carry-out a few times and have always enjoyed the food, but recently we tried to order and were told that they were not accepting carry-out orders because they were "backed up."\n\nThis unreliability really bugs me and makes me much less likely to plan on ordering from them again in the future. I would have accepted a longer wait time for food or whatever, but I've never heard of a restaurant just shutting down take-out without warning because they happen to be busy! It makes no sense.\n\nAs far as food goes, the ga pow is tasty with a very nice basil flavor, their tom yum soup is good and perfect for when you're not feeling good if you can get them to make it spicy enough, and I really like the ginger fried rice- when I am actually allowed to order it, that is.	3	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	rUW7_B9pBNdDR3Y2bBz9TQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The chicken wings might be better than Soyo's. I got a thai beef salad to go. I ordered it Thai hot which was almost unbearable. Almost. The problem was despite the heat, the salad was so good I couldn't stop. Call me a masochist. I will order my salad at an 8 instead of a 10 next time.

t-Lua07Yly-6olxJyB0pdw	5	2017-06-22 00:00:00	After a day out on Fremont Street, all I wanted was some delicious thai food. I was so excited to find this place and to see all the raving reviews. I tried two items- chicken pad thai and their masaman curry with tofu. We were ordering take out at first, but after we received our food, we chose to eat it on the patio instead. The bartenders were quite friendly and the food was ready pretty quickly. The chicken pad thai was some of the best I've ever had, if not the very best. It was so flavorful and light- not too saucey but it didn't miss out on any flavors. I was obsessed and didn't want it to end. The masaman curry was very good as well. The chicken pad thai stuck out as being the star of the show though. Brendan agreed and my friends loved it as well. If I come back to Fremont Street, I'm running here for some more delicious pad thai.	0	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	DeXKbQYNx52OlOizobOLJw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I called ahead to ask about parking and they said that the street parking was free. When I arrived, I only saw metered parking which was free after 6pm. The set up of the place was interesting. There is a small area with a bar & some tables. Then, they have a larger enclosed patio with more tables. The food was spicy even though we had asked for mild. It would have been better if it wasn't as spicy. The prices are not really cheap. Also, I could see part of the kitchen from where we were sitting and I noticed one of the guys working in the kitchen sneezing off and on.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	d1dPI4PT0cLZMgEAvbCJMQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
T5V2iBob4Fz6DuE4unZEWQ	4	2013-08-09 00:00:00	Thai cuisine is healthy cuisine-no doubt about it. But only in the hands of the good chefs. I get turned off by the commercialization of the cuisine from few over zealous, who are social chefs and part time chefs/owners. To attract the mainstream food lovers who have a sweet tooth, they add palm sugar to every dish to make it blander for the palate. This is akin to putting raisins in an Indian delicacy called Biryani. This practice should be outlawed and the violators put away in some kind of Culinary Prison !\n\nFew of the Thai places in this town are overrated by the same crowd who seem to think that Taco Bell has the best Mexican food and Olive Garden has the best Italian food. Now, palm sugar is not only too much sugar but it is from the palm trees and neither the sugar or the oil is healthy since it has the most saturated fat of all oils. But it is cheap which explains the overuse. \n\nAuthentic food is in the palate of the beholder and not reading reviews or five start ratings. Some chefs have the touch and other don't . This place is small but the food is very authentic and simple. The Pad Thai is delectable just the right amount of spice and crispiness. The location is not the best with problem of parking and safety specially after dark.. I only go during the day time since the location is not the safest after dark. The food is not fusion Thai or some variance,  that is now prevalent in Urban areas to appeal to the Teenyboppers who really have no clue about what the original food tasted like.. Suffice to say this is the  Best Thai Restaurant in Las Vegas.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	QsznkLEL_ljuk6UUMd1ukg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

tfSqd-aZTBecgcXsd5CDqg	3	2016-02-03 00:00:00	Le Thai is more downtown than Thai.\n\nI have to applaud any business that makes a go at surviving in Downtown Las Vegas. The pressure to serve, provide quality food and live up to the facade that is Downtown Hip is a hard existence. Le Thai seems to manage all of these at the expense of an interesting and unique menu.\n\nThere was nothing wrong with the food but there was nothing great about the food. Fried rice was fried rice -step down from the Basil fried rice that had Thai fans doing backflips on West Sahara. The curry was delicious. All curry is delicious. Le Thai however did not blow my curry filled brain. The Pad Thai was standard. Chefs should be challenged. \n\nSo then we come to the atmosphere. Le Thai is divided into three sections. There are some patio tables out front, a really crammed indoor section in the center and some sort of a quasi outdoor/sunroom in the back. It reminds me of some of the ruined houses in Huntridge or John S. Park where the low income residents would convert the space between the house and the back wall into a room with a tarp for a roof so grandpa has a place to stay. Le Thai has a golden opportunity to utilize the space but fall flat with tarp roof, cheap trellis,hanging plug-in heaters and good ol' fashioned PTA style tables and chairs. Maybe some sprucing up of the back area will have an effect on how customers enjoy the menu. \n\nThe service was fine, food was delivered in good time and we never felt neglected nor pestered.\n\nIf you are searching for terrific, transcendent Thai food, Le Thai can only deliver the charm that is a downtown trying real hard not to be skanky.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	zDjzFJEgx8hxARZoYGXlnw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Front is small but the patio behind is big. They lose one star for having the 5 of us on a bar stool sitting straight instead of round the table. It gets hot in summer and they have nice mist running up on the ceiling which we loved. Its packed to the brim on most evenings and seems to be a favorite among Fremont street visitors.

I feel it denigrates my ratings but, in reality, it does the opposite; it actually rewards the privileged restaurants I get to go when they are excellent.\n\nMy friend Dan has been randomly touting this place  every time the word "Vegas" is mentioned.  I always thought, " how can a Thai place be so outstanding"? Well, it can!\n\n\nFirst, it's in this revitalized part of downtown across from the el Cortez . It's a super cool restaurant inside, with a big misty patio.\n\nI sat alone thank God, as the wait would have been 45 minutes. I sat at the counter and really cute waitress helped me, and I ordered a special- dry noodles w a variety of stuff. It was fresh and delicious. I can't say more.  I can't wait to go back, and since here for a few more days, I might.\n\nI know, it will be more crowded w a 5 star review, but they deserve it.\n\nOne request- open in LA!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	VBkkaKtz9eMvJ1NYRyDPng	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

TsMg-P5EVbw9LusnnG5XcQ	3	2014-01-08 00:00:00	So this place has a ridiculous amount of reviews but I felt the need to throw in my two cents. As the only thai restaurant on Fremont, this place is good. It's actually probably one of the few good places to eat (for now) on E. Fremont. Their curry is actually pretty good, but the rice and noodle dishes are inconsistent from sweet to salty and it always seems like they oversaturate these plates with oil. Plenty of amazing things to try BUT with that being said this place is so ridiculously overhyped. I don't know if it's the drunk Roberto's effect or the "wow Panda Express is the best Chinese food" type. \n\nYes this place is a must try...if you're on Fremont. But for those that have said it is the best or one of the best thai places in the city please smack the kool-aid out fo your hand and get out more. This place does not even warrant top five consideration in Las Vegas (lotus of siam, archi's, weera's, Thai style noodle house, even Pin Kaow) and that's excluding four amazing thai restaurants in Henderson. It is good, but anyone that tells you it is the best thai in the city, take it with a grain of salt.	3	3	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	09Jn_afJxwZ20eukds1nxA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

tUNcn06hMBsKd7M6bQhjog	2	2013-03-23 00:00:00	Still in search for the best Thai food in town!\n\nSorry to say...Le Thai didn't do much for me! Yes, the location is convenient if you are already downtown, but the prices were fairly high here ($9 each for lunch specials...shown in pics) and $13 for the Pad Kee Mao! Probably the most I've ever paid for this staple!\n\nBut prices aside, how does the food fare? Because that is all that matters when searching for the best of the best!  Have to say I was disappointed! \n\nAlthough my baby loved his tofu and mixed veggies :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#T1qpoYYf5aG4hAROkF0HUQ\n\nThe Pad Ka Pao and Pad Kee Mao were NOT very spicy (maybe a 5/10 in my book) when asking for a Thai spicy 5/5 on their scale, and the dishes weren't memorable! \n\nThe Ka Pao felt like it was missing something :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#ZzFcqxklGCNa5NCK-L7Apw\n\nThe presentation was beautiful and mouth watering with them mincing up the meat just how I like and with the fried egg on top, but maybe the meat wasn't cooked long enough in the juices, because it just wasn't flavorful enough.  Tasted like it was missing something vital that everyone else has, and I always order this dish trying a new Thai spot in town.\n\nThe Kee Mao was very very oily :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#0o-6s4elvRBGJHvxewPA_Q\n\nLook at the coloring on the noodles! It had a good flavor, but the oils were very heavy and caught up later if you know what I mean...Just compare the COLOR of the noodles to a known competitor and you can see what I mean about that oil! :\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pan-asian-las-vegas?select=hQ_CNCpMGO70mnL7vy55jg#JCVcxvcLGhlfJivt4Ceoww\n\nMy baby loved his food though! \n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/le-thai-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#RGxx_22s1Q3ldI9OqyjrBw\n\nIf you are searching for nearby eats downtown, maybe give it a go!

The location is great, sandwiched between the bars and discount stores on Fremont.\nI had the Three Color Curry, spice level 3. I like my food spicy and this was the perfect level for me. The curry (with pork) was very good, with the sauce being the star and the pork had a supporting role. I sat at the bar and service was pretty quick. There is a happy hour, and I didn't order from that menu.

The staff is very friendly but I did notice that the two tables beside us had peanuts and we didn't.

U7Jbnpr11Lj9Vbbb5coBRQ	4	2016-11-10 00:00:00	My first impression of this place was really wonderful. The place is small yet comfortable, the hostess was super friendly on the phone and in person AND our server was a very friendly vegan! That last part was my favorite because it feels so rare to find other vegans and I was psyched to have a server fully understand how it feels to order food at a non vegan restaurant. Im sure I come off as needy and overly inquisitive when I go out to eat, so it's a relief to have a vegan take your order. They get it. \n\nThe server started by explaining the vegan options and how a majority of items can be veganized and I was so excited! I ordered the pad see ew with mixed veggies and steamed tofu - spicy level 2 out of 5 - and their spin off of a Thai Julip (can't remember the name but it was amazing)\n\nFor a 2, my pad see ew tasted more like a 0.. but the flavor was great! I never thought to inspect my food because, I mean, a vegan took my order so it will be totally vegan right? Low and behold, I find little bits of scrambled EGG in it after having eaten several bites. I was crushed. \n\nAfter bringing it to the waiters attention, he was very upset to have let something like that happen and asked if he could have the cook remake the dish but at that point my appetite was gone. He took the dish off the bill and gave us a discount, as well as being very apologetic about the mistake. \n\nBy the time I got home, my stomach had turned and I was so sick my boyfriend called the restaurant. Neither of us expected that little bit of egg to cause me so much grief but I guess after not eating it for such a long time, my stomach was NOT cool with it. Management totally took care of this situation over the phone and I am really looking forward to giving Le Thai another chance.\n\nIt sucks for this to happen but I'm not going to give them a shitty review for making one error. We are human and at the end of the day, humans make errors.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	4Lih7V69TZ1VTNziz8rs9w	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
U7QA8b3ESoZYB1fYFCZG2g	5	2016-01-06 00:00:00	This is one of the best Thai restaurants in Vegas.  This is not your traditional Thai restaurant but it is more of a fusion style with really good flavor and selections.\n\nThe place is small and at the end of the Fremont Street experience.  Parking can be found along the streets with a garage about one block away.  They also have an outdoor seating area with a to go Window.  Tables and chairs are fairly basic and rattan looking.  The background music is your typical lounge easy listening sound.  It's eclectic and goes well with setting the mood. Reservations are a must as this place gets really busy during the dinner time rush hour.  \n\nThe drink menu has some very interesting concoctions as well as a unique beer selection.  My wife loved the Peachtini and Thaijito. I ordered the Thai Iced tea but it was really on the sweet side.  \n\nFood is the reason you go here.  For appetizers, the must haves are pork jerky and waterfall beef.  For mains, short rib fried rice and the Currys are great choices. Every order comes with either steamed rice or sticky rice so keep that in mind when ordering.  Finish off the meal with Roti dessert which is like a crepe pizza made with Nutella and egg.  It sounds strange but it tastes delicious.  One order is enough to share for two.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	GEedb5rb_Fww6YJc6CRSsg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We started with LARB which is basically a chicken lettuce wrap- Thai style and it was my favorite! Ground chicken with fresh herbs and lime juice - yummmay - just bursts with a bouquet of flavors in your mouth. I'm going to try and make it this weekend I liked it so much. Way better than Pei Wei or PFs.\n\nNext we shared YELLOW CURRY chicken which is my standard Thai order (level 5 heat was just on the edge of too spicy but right for me) and an order of the DRUNKEN NOODLEs with beef. Both were mouthwatering. Portions were great, we took some home for later.\n\nService was also excellent. Only downside is the location, of course parking downtown sucks and is exceptionally crowded at lunch time. Restaurant is small so get there early.

ulD_NjKvoZKuFU0x3vSn4A	5	2017-06-10 00:00:00	This is my fourth time at Le Thai. Located close to Fremont and not too far off from the courthouse and the law offices, it's a little place that stays busy. You'll have everyone from tourists to locals. This location has three areas you can sit in. There's a couple tables in front of the restaurant outside, a little bar area with a couple small tables inside, and lastly, a back outside area for larger groups of 4-5. \n\nThe two things I get frequently and recommend are the Three Color Curry with your choice of chicken, beef, tofu, or shrimp and the Fried Rice Short Rib. \n\nThe Three Color Curry is a mix of their Yellow, Green, and Red Curry. It's super good. Ive had it with everything but beef and shrimp is my favorite way to go. You'll have an option of white or brown rice to be able to enjoy with that curry. Their spicy scale is 1 - 5. I love spicy food so their five was. Itching to me. Those with a good tolerance would probably want to add more. They have a little spice tray to adjust it to your preference they can bring you. \n\nThe Fried Rice Short Rib is their signature dish. It is pretty fantastic. They knock the meat off the short Rib and toss it in their to make a mouth water dish. The part I enjoy the most? They toss a fried egg on top of there. If you're really hungry, this is the one. \n\nThe service is good, too. If they mess up your spicy rating, they will not hesitate to make you a new batch. This happened to my boss and they were quick to not charge him.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	zKAwyRCGNpZ0fHu67YBUrg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

AMAZING!!\n\nI get the feeling Thai places are like sushi places, everyone has THEIR spot. So, yeah maybe I haven't tried every single one in town, but this food is tasty and wonderful every time. Cool little spot (emphasis on little) that is great for lunch, dinner with friends or a late night post beers craving blaster. The service is friendly and they don't make you feel like a fool if you don't know every ingredient on the menu. The outdoor seating looks awesome for when it's not 100 degrees, the night we went and wanted to sit there it was closed. Sad face. \n\nAny type of the curry chicken is awesome and the serving is huge. The chicken satay is tender and flavorful. I think my favorite may be the Awesome Noodles...YUM. Sweet and spicy, my two favorite things. By the way they are not kidding about the spice scale. I get a 1 and that is fine for me and I don't consider myself a spice prude....I don't even know how a human eats a 5 there. \n\nA great place definitely worth the trip downtown, but it's tiny so you might have to wait a bit. Worth it!!	2	0	3	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	B7mqXzrSFKM_Wff2tbBagw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
UwGP0SWOKw6zYdhQRB_UJw	4	2014-01-18 00:00:00	This is a nice little hole in the wall Thai place on Fremont Street, just a block away from where the street starts becoming really touristy.  The outside of this restaurant is a little too inconspicuous.  I walked by this place twice while looking for it.  There needs to be a little more signage outside.\n\nOne of the cool things about this restaurant are the dining options.  There's a walk-up window for people who want to get take out, or want to sit outside and do a little people watching while they're eating or just waiting for their order to be ready.  If you decide to eat inside the restaurant, you have the choice to sit indoors in an area right between the bar and the kitchen, or continue walking further into an outdoor area.  The waitresses here are extremely friendly.\n\nI forgot the name of the item I ordered, but it was really good.  It was tofu and vegetables.  They asked me how spicy I wanted my food on a scale of 1-5, and I said 4.  The waitress said "Are you sure?  That's pretty spicy.  Once it's made, we can't change it."  I assured her I could handle it.  I was able to get through my meal, but not without having to blow my nose a bunch of times because the spice level had my sinuses going.  My eyes were tearing up and my ears were on fire, but it was worth it.  I think I paid $11 for my food, which is a good deal.  The portions are quite large. \n\nI'm always on the lookout for good Thai restaurants, and this is definitely a good one.  If you're in this part of town and looking for a nice place to eat lunch or dinner, or if you just want hassle-free take out, this is the place for you.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	n6n3RnhXjdFKxVntanRGWw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

You can get on the list and they'll text you. No shortage of bars within walking distance while you wait. I'm not sure how long a larger group would actually have to wait. It seems like it would take forever. Word of advice, ditch the friends and eat solo if you have to or pick your favorite friend and share the goodness with a table for two.\n\nIt used to be relatively intimate and nice to have a conversation now, commonwealth is so unbelievably loud, my noodles were shaking to the beat of their bass. The food is worth it, it's ok.\n\nI've gone with vegan and vegetarian friends who were perfectly satisfied.\n\nIn a world with chain restaurants and sauces piled atop mounds of mostly inedible goop, it stands apart with real flavors that taste like food....fantastic food!	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	zLrlRMNgife678VppfI-ZA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I've eaten "street food" in dozens of countries and dined in some pretty high end places on many other occasions in my 46 laps around the sun.  \n\nThis was easily in the top five meals in my life.  \n\nThe Drunken Noodles (3 Spicy) had more depth and complexity than some meals I've paid for costing four or five times more.

After we arrived we were sat about 5-8 mins later. This is a big deal because this place is tiny and super popular. \n\nYou can sit outside, at the adorable patio or inside if you prefer. This time of year is perfect for outdoor dining so I take full advantage of it. The music they played was similar to my own playlist of funky, cool and International vibes and I loved it.\n\nService was attentive and friendly and thanks for the complimentary Thai ice tea! It could have been sweeter for my tastebuds but it was still very smooth & refreshing. \n\nWe ordered the red curry chicken lunch special which was spicy and very flavorful and the Thai chicken fried rice which was some of the best I've tried. The eggs had a sweet note to them and I loved that they added tomatoes and cucumbers to the mix.\n\nThe crab rangoons were delicate and perfectly molded and also tasted great. \n\nOverall the vibes in here were a lot of fun and we enjoyed ourselves. They do offer lunch specials and happy hour so that's a great time to try them to see if you're into it.	27	22	27	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I can't imagine #5. It must be uneatable! The service was a little slow and nobody smiled. It made everything slightly uncomfortable. My wife spilled her water on the table and nobody offered to clean it up, eventhough they watched it happen. Our beers were cool, but not cold. Cold beer is a necessity.

When I brought it to the servers attention she brought a new piece of lettuce. Then she took the dirty lettuce back to the kitchen which has a large window that you can see into from the dining room.

Today I had a late afternoon lunch, and ordered the happy hour chicken skewers. The waitress warned me that two sticks  would be filling , but for six dollars I couldn't imagine them being that big. \n\nI must say that I was wrong. The happy hour appetizer chicken skewers would be equivalent to two full-size chicken breasts. It came with a small cucumber salad and peanut satay dressing. It was really delicious. I couldn't even finish the appetizer and I was hungry. \n\nI ordered a beer so I didn't feel like such a Jew, and could give the waitress a big tip.\n\nI am seriously full with a happy belly.	0	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Q-ydrhfqmmOxRb38H6mmEQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

vgswrjpGJDNzccsRCJP2xw	3	2014-10-08 00:00:00	So, a month ago I would have five starred this place but my last experience gave me a bad taste but not from the food! I have been to le Thai,at least ten times. I love the pad see ew, the green curry, and awesome noodles. Even their spiked thai tea is delicious. I dont mind having to wait an hour since you can wander off to container park and they will text you when your table is ready! \n\nHowever, my last visit was tarnished by less than stellar service. After waiting an hour we were seated on the back patio. About halfway through my meal I requested a second spiked thai tea. After I had finished my meal, it still hadnt come. 30 minutes after I ordered it the waiter showed up at the table apologizing stating that the bar was super busy. At that point I just canceled the order and asked for the check. The check was paid in under 10 minutes and we were getting ready to leave when the hostess came to our table and asked us to move to another bar area because she had a group that had been waiting for 30 minutes for a table!!! Well maybe we would have been gone 30 min earlier if I hadnt been waiting for my drink! And by the way... we waited an hour! How embarrasing to be treated like that! Too bad I had already given a 20 percent tip! Oh and on the way out.... not a single solitary soul was at the bar. My guess? The waiter forgot and then tried to cover his tracks with a lie.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	pQ6iB1cFtWiHsv4jEsvg1w	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I SHOULD HAVE GONE SOONER!!!!   In the vein of the Griffin, Beauty Bar and other cool revived downtown spots - Le Thai offers a really cool atmosphere with outdoor seating that feels very much like what I imagine being in Thailand would feel like!  If only they had a waterway nearby, lol.  We ordered the Tom Kha soup with chicken, Chicken Pad Thai and Pork panang  .  The soup was YUMMY!  And I eat A LOT of Thai food.  It was flavorful with big chunks of tender chicken, mushrooms and scallions.  Use the green chili chunk sauce to give it a tasty, tangy punch!  The Pad Thai was the most extraordinary.  It had a very cool grilled taste to the noodles??? Never had a Pad Thai quite like it.  Was weirdly delicious!  The Pork panang was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  NOTE:  Their stuff is SPICY!  Order a 1 or a 2 if you aren't sure about spice levels.  Looking to go again this coming weekend and trying the meatball soup!  Can't wait.  (p.s. they take order on ipods, lol it's fun, quirky and cool)  Also any number of servers will come to your table and make sure you are doing well.  Price wise we also ordered BIG Singha beer and steamed rice and for all it came to about $45.  Not bad at all.  p.p.s. The menu is the little placard on the table when you sit down, lol.	1	2	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	kWCkJR_xj2av_tS29q-QWA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

HATE Mercy the server.\n\nin fact...if it weren't for Mercy, this would be a 5 star review.\n\n This review is based on our second visit and our second time having Mercy as our server...\n\nmy complaints:\n\n-party of 5. at first we were seated indoors but were kindly asked by our original server, Olivia, if she could reseat us outside because they couldn't have underage people inside (where the bar is). understandable. no big deal. MERCY comes out of nowhere, buts into our conversation and makes a snide comment about people shouldn't have their kids out past 10. it was 930. the kid was 15 & dining with his mom. f-off. Olivia takes our order for apps and drinks so the food would be ready at the same time our new table was ready.\n\n-Mercy gets short with us as we're finishing apps because we don't know what we want for dinner...why? because we didn't have a chance to look at the menu after we moved tables. f-off.\n\n-then we were ignored for about an hour. thai food =spicy. you'd think our server would ask if we wanted any drinks or our water refilled. nope. \n\n-Mercy Drops the check without asking if we'd like to order dessert...the ONLY thing we came down there was for their roti dessert. f-off.\n\n-we finally decide to close our bill out. ask to split the check in half. so she does. literally. we present 2 cards. she runs BOTH halves of the tab onto ONE card. f-off.\n\nps. i never received my beverage. F-OFF, MERCY!\n\n\n\nas for my compliments...\nfood is delicious and reasonably priced...actually, pretty cheap compared to other Thai places AND other restaurants in general.\n\nwe tried the pad Thai, short rib fried rice (get a fried egg on top), Thai style fried rice with beef, 3 color curry, waterfall beef, Thai jerky, and chicken satay summer plate (minus the soda that never came). it was ALL yummy. we ordered everything at a 2 or 3 and it was pretty spicy but still tasty.\n\nget the roti. i personally never would have thought to put an omelette on my dessert but it works... puff pastry, nutella, eggs and powdered sugar. super simple and tasty.	3	2	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ahj9FxM6MQBU501LGypcCQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

vJ5jFJyC2cw7fOmG9UCcgw	4	2014-11-17 00:00:00	Le Thai is small and very popular, which means long waits during lunch and dinner time (tried to go last month and there was a 45 min. wait time for lunch!).  It's pretty typical thai food, nothing about it really stands out to me and they don't do anything unusual with their dishes- which I don't mind.  Their curry is VERY SPICY- I normally get a 3-4 at other restaurants, but a 1 here is very hot.  Our server last time told me it's the curry base they use, it's hot!!  All of their curries are very good though- I've tried each type.  Overall, this place is not as good as Pin Kaow, which has bigger servings and is more "comfort food" style than this place.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	eD2YmdHwXmns0fI9NEOByQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The reason I went were tonight, but after I walked away Le Thai the newest hippester eatery on Fremont Street it seemed like better alternative.

Ordered the awesome noodles, spicy level 4.  That spicy level may have been a bit of a mistake - definitely had me sweating, and may have overwhelmed the flavors a bit.  On the other hand, this is one of the few places I been where I ordered something spicy, and didn't feel the need to add more spice.  \n\nI think the dish was okay in general, but I was expecting more from the high reviews I'd read.  If the place had wowed me, I would have brought the GF back for dinner (she's a huge pad thai fan), but it just struck me as average.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	fpiirm8MU_hSJBjHpbtIUA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I could literally eat here all the time, 1 - I love Thai food and 2 - its the best I have had since leaving Seattle. \n\nI ordered the Short Rib Fried Rice sans Egg (allergic and all). Dear good lord, it was heaven. Seriously I was like, if all fried rice tasted this good, I don't know what else I would want for dinner. The flavor was amazing, it came out hot and freshly cooked. I highly recommend it. \n\nMy friend had the Panang Curry w/Tofu. That is my next order (which I plan on getting this week). Again it had a great flavor profile, everything was fresh and on point. \n\nIt was Friday at 7pm or so and we were lucky enough to sit at the bar, the bartenders were super friendly and accommodating and as we waiting and then ate our food we heard the to-go orders were on a 45-60 minute wait. Well it's worth it! \n\nHeads up if you call they only take reservations for 6 or more.	2	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	5LE-pxvIqxFtJxRg-qpCHQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

VRsDIt-zxrp_2vEWspgmZQ	3	2017-02-02 00:00:00	I went into this place really excited and wanting to love it. My friend brought me to it and there were a lot of people that recommended it so I went for it. The service was so slow that it just made the experience annoying.\n\nWe were waiting outside for the hostess to acknowledge that we were even there. We probably stood there for five minutes while she was walking around fixing the outside tables when they didn't need fixing. We were finally sat down after a bit.\n\nWe sat there for a good ten minutes and someone finally came to tell us our server would be with us. The server comes a few minutes later and asked us what we wanted. I didn't know what I wanted because we weren't given menus. \n\nWhen we finally ordered, we waited a long time to get our food. Our server told us it was because they had a big party that they just served which was fine BUT the tables next to us who sat later than us got their meals. I was so annoyed and hungry. They didn't even come back to give us more water or ask us if we needed anything.\n\nThe meals were good. We got the Pad Thai and the Ga Pow. The Pad Thai was really good especially with the shrimp. The Ga Pow was really salty. It was good but just really salty.\n\nThe whole experience was just ruined by the service and I wouldn't recommend this place to my friends. There are other Thai places they can go to with the same entrees and less expensive too.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	9k2et25tG8kSj9Q3hqj9xA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It's a great little restaurant with an attentive staff and an impressive menu.\n\nThe only down side? Be prepared to wait. It took 3 days of waiting on my trip to finally be able to stop by and get a table within 20 minutes. The wait is usually well over an hour, or they just flat out tell you there are no tables.

At least the background instrumentals were dope.\n\nThe food was pretty good. I got the yellow curry mild cause I'm a pussy with spicy food.

VVQMRh7ekD9ADK6KuNbvQw	5	2016-02-28 00:00:00	Whenever in Vegas and staying anywhere near downtown, I always visit La Thai!  Everything I have tried is very good, however what I always crave and have to order is the Tom Kha soup which is awesome! You know from the moment it arrives your in for a treat as the smell wafting up from the bowl is amazing, it tickles the senses!  Then you dive in and experience an explosion of different flavors.  In each spoonful you get a exotic mixture of coconut, fresh mushrooms lemon, cilantro, spring onions,ginger, and Thai spice. Also if you ask they will gladly add rice noodles to the soup which I definitely recommend. \n\nThe place is not large and so on the weekend there is usually a little wait.  However during the week have never had any wait.  Also they have a take out window were you can order to go. They also have a small patio with 5 were you can sit outside and watch the flow on Fremont street which is always interesting! In addition the service each time I have visited has been very good and always friendly.  \n\nMy only word of advice when you order they ask how spicy you want it.  They offer from 0 (no spice) to 5 (Thai spice), with 3 listed as hot. Well this rating scale is accurate!  I have found most places embellish so if 3 says hot, well it is usually not really that hot.   Howeveri I have ordered a 3  at La Thai and it was definitely hot!	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	H2z5UMwtZUp9e9PorsooHA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
VwDbqEHJW-c3mZeF-O1MFw	3	2016-07-26 00:00:00	My co-worker has been raving about this restaurant for some time now, she says it's the best Thai food she's ever had, well...\n\nI wanted to give her the benefit of the doubt, I didn't want to hype it up before I even taste the food. I truly believe that Lotus of Siam is the best Thai food in the country, the whole entire United States of America, that's how good Lotus of Siam is, very hard to compete. \n\nIt's a cute little spot, very small, the restaurant, kitchen & bar is literally like the size of my bedroom. They have a front patio area and a back patio area, they sat us at the side bar in the back, I didn't realize it was open air, it was over 100 degrees outside so they had the misters going, which is great to cool us down but then we're moist, the food is moist, my glasses got fogged up, it was a hot mess back there.\n\nThen the club next door started tuning their instruments, and it got louder, and louder, to the point we couldn't even hear each other talk anymore. \n\nLet's talk about the food, that's why we're here in the first place. The shrimp pad thai was good, was it the best? No, sadly it wasn't. The beef salad was alright, needed a lot of lime juice. We gave it a try and it just wasn't our kind of place, sorry Lotus is still the best of the best.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	B0ENvYKQdNNr1Izd2r-BAA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Everything on the menu is amazing, but my two faves are the Chicken Tom Yum Soup and the Short Rib Fried Rice. If you're super hungry or just want to get your meat fix, add extra short rib. It's delicious. Make sure to call on your way there or put your name on the wait list through Yelp, cause the wait can be lengthy. Also, sometimes they close completely for private parties but don't notify via their website or Yelp, so it's better to plan ahead so you're not disappointed.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	v-Qba5-vGYD309R6zgciww	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

VxRpl822lzyUrvXNKxtJpQ	4	2017-06-05 00:00:00	My girlfriends and I met here a couple weeks ago for an early dinner. It was the last half of happy hour and we got a table for four with no wait. They even sat us before our entire party arrived!! \n\nWe enjoyed the Happy Hour chicken skewers and some drinks. The Appetizer comes with three skewers and a peanut sauce on the side. My friend Ms. J was absolutely crazy about the sauce and kept what was left over to eat with her Entree. \n\nFor my Entree I tried the yellow curry at the lowest spice level possible. I ordered it with beef and asked for an extra order of pork, too. This definitely made the portion large enough that I took half home to my husband! The dish still had a bit of heat, even at their lowest. So if you're not much for spicy, try a lower number first.	8	0	6	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It has patio seating outside and also extended seating inside with more extended seating outside towards the back. \nUpon walking in we were greeted by a server who shouted. . . How many? It was just 2 guests so we sat right near the window table near the front door.\nWe were seated on a deuce and it was still rather dirty.\nIt had prints from the previous guest and also oil stains. I really wish they would have wiped it more thoroughly. \nAbout a minute later the server comes and says hello. She let us know of the lunch specials and told us that they were ending in 3 minutes and that we would have to quickly decide if that's what we wanted. We felt rushed so we politely declined and opted for the normal menu.\nI ordered the pad Thai and my friend ordered the wide noodle with beef. We also ordered a white rice as well. Both were really delicious and full of flavor!\nThe server Never Brought The White Rice That We had requested, which was annoying.\nFor dessert,  we got the mango and sticky rice and it was delicious!  The mango was juicy and sweet and the rice had the perfect texture!\nI'm not sure if I would eat here again.\nI felt rushed and forgotten at this place and I think it may need to work on its cleanliness a bit.\nOther than that, the food was good.

I also ordered the ga pow with sliced chicken. I wasn't a fan of the curry but I thoroughly enjoyed the ga pow with sliced chicken. Unlike other Thai restaurants the chicken here is pretty moist.

w2VI0XHwmEAOpDFoDTQnoA	4	2012-03-07 00:00:00	When you emerge from the Beat's Tuesday Trivia Night with two vegan co-players and all of you are famished, Le Thai appears amidst the quiet downtown streets like a mirage in the desert, one that will do more than quench your thirst.  Smooth-sounding name, bi-environment seating with heaters outdoors, and a refreshingly short menu with many options to each dish - this joint is quite the little gem.\n\nAlmost every dish is offered to be cooked with tofu and brown rice.  Stir-fried noodles are served in bowls, a nice change to the visual palette.  Food quality is good and the amount is overflowing, with attentive service that won't hesitate to tell you when you've ordered a spice level you probably won't be able to handle.    \n\nChicken Kra Pow is reliable but could be a bit too saucy.  Wings are yummy and definitely flavored with a signature fish-sauce taste, which adds to the addictive element.  My favorite is definitely the Awesome Noodles, like a love child between Pad See Ew and Pad Kee Mao, Awesome Noodles serves up smoky noodles stir-fried with a yummy amount of the underrated Asian vegetable-bean sprouts.  Le Thai, you're my favorite new downtown stop!	3	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Nh75diBuPgSSBMNoT5IGDA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
w7uT_GolgdN03fi1_Wj2Dw	5	2016-06-06 00:00:00	One of the best Thai I've ever had. The food had umami. The place was pretty packed on Friday night. Best part is that they are open till midnight. \nThe waitress knew what she was doing, honored our Yelp check in deal without any hesitations. She got water without ice even without asking so she knew the Indian clientele well. She also served some nice spicy peanuts while we waited. \nShe was frank enough to tell us that only truly vegetarian options are massamun curry and padkemao noodles as rest of the items have fish sauce. We ordered both. \nThe noodles were really really tasty. The massamun curry was awesome too, perfectly cooked to the right spice level and full of veggies. Their tofu was one of the best I've had, melt in the mouth. \nThe only complaint is he loud music on the back patio- I would have preferred some Thai music instead of hip hop rap. \nThe back patio doesn't have AC but they sprayed some aerosol mist which was very refreshing. Portions were big and prices were reasonable compared to the strip. Best option, especially if you're in the Fremont area.	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	jCEPqPBIWLCW0c9jVGbAPg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

wB_GlL4JMVPhnyZyKpbmQA	5	2013-04-28 00:00:00	I think this is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas after a year of being here. It's a step towards filling the massive "cozy, clean, and unique" restaurant void. It's a small place with very few tables, a tiny bar, and a wonderful little patio that features heat lamps in the winter and cooling in the summer. Ahhhh.\n\nPros\n- That patio.\n- The food is authentic, delicious, and actually spicy. I've tried the Pad Thai, the yellow curry, and the three-color curry, and all the appetizers, and I've loved everything.\n- The price is right; you can get 2 dinners, an appetizer, and 2 beers for about $35, and leave fat, tipsy, and happy\n\nCons\n- Limited size of the restaurant plus their newly "discovered by the mainstream" status means that when they are busy, waits can be long and service can be slow.	2	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Only downside is that I've never been able to walk in and eat.  There is always a wait.  So Not really a downside because it's just always busy. .com	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	5wfw-Vli1zPVIVRHmFIXeA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Everything from short rib fried rice, to noodle dishes to a beef appetizer with the best damn broth ever!

We6t74MnzC2TcOcTpsiYCw	5	2012-09-28 00:00:00	this place's the place to be.  its my third day in LV and I've eaten here twice, once for lunch, once for dinner.  had their green curry chicken w/ brown rice for lunch, that stuff's the bomb dude.  they got the lunch special that comes w/ a drink.  it was a nice friendly lil place and i just ate at the bar and chatted w/ one of the owners there.  night time, i was there again with a couple of friends, this time i was eating in their outdoor section that was pretty nice.  if i wasn't reminded of being in downtown vegas, this place can easily pass off as one of the other dinner places i go to in San Francisco.  had their pad see ew, and the waiter asked me if i wanted it spicy, i had no idea it's supposed to be spicy but sure, level 2 was perfect for me.  it had the flavor without being overpowering.  my buddy actually got the level 5 (out of 5) and he managed that just fine.  supposedly you can request for ghost pepper if you want to also, but uhrm, yea, no thanks for me there! =P  \n\nFood - 4 star - pretty decent for what you pay\nAtmosphere - 4 star - nice lively crowd without being too loud/rowdy\nService - 5 star - very nice n friendly folks here.	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	-IQYqzUs5oNsquP-0rk5Fw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I asked for my coke in a frosted glass and she put it in a to go cup....\n\nI asked to use my yelp check in reward and she said I couldn't use it for the iced tea during happy hour.....? I have NEVER been denied a reward before.\n\nI got the chicken pad Thai. The portion was a good size. Had a really good taste. Could use more peanuts. \n\nAtmosphere is very chill. Other service staff was friendly when I was leaving. Next time I go I wish to have a better server. I would still come here for lunch when it isn't busy.	4	5	3	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
wfduza4Ih3wwipbta7NLdw	2	2015-03-01 00:00:00	Arrived at 11:30pm. Open until midnight, but we were told that we could not be seated. The only option given to us was that we could order food to-go. The lady said "we are not seating anyone, we are just trying to get through our list". What list?!? There was no one waiting and 3 open tables. I was speechless.  I could not even say anything in response. This lady CAN NOT be serious. It's 30 minutes before the scheduled time to close! I immediately looked at my boyfriend with utmost disgust and pulled out my phone. She must have thought I was going to post a YELP review...which I was going to eventually...and then all of sudden she said "ohhh uhhhh...someone decided they were going to take their food to go, so you can have their table".  \n\nOur server was kind, and the food was average...my experience is tainted by the poor customer service from the start.	5	2	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	5EIezEAjH2wka1emqER2Cg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
wfH-KC4owj1oD4ACN3lRWw	5	2017-03-04 00:00:00	This is an absolutely amazing Thai restaurant located on Fremont East. They sure know their spice here! I've been to other Thai restaurants and asked for my food spicy hot, and it it's been so-so. This place got the spice right on point! The number 3 which is labeled "hot", was definitely very spicy and warming.The panang curry was a delicious bowl of sweet, spicy, and fresh ingredients. The waterfall beef was a great appetizer. If you are not into spice, this is a great choice since they only prepare it mild. The beef was tender, and it came served with delicious sticky rice.  The Thaijito cocktail was amazing! It was a refreshing twist on a mojito. I absolutely recommend this place for anyone who likes Thai food. Just be warned, the place is small and they get very busy and do not take reservations.	2	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ObQl16Vuc4sHPGKtzSGNUw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
Wga-hxPz_K1TJw3k6eq2LA	4	2012-06-16 00:00:00	Really tasty food with a couple of decent vegetarian options too! The pad thai was nice and the Eggplant with the tofu was a big hit at our table. It's all pretty spicy though and I'm glad that I ordered it at level 3 because I doubt I could have taken it any spicier.\n\nInside it gets a bit cramped but they have a great courtyard out back that is covered and has misting sprayers, which makes it comfortable to sit outside even on a pretty hot day.\n\n The service was maybe just a little slow, but they were very nice and it was worth the wait.  I didn't collect my check in offer of a free hug, but I saved it for later because I'll be back again.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	zaC3L_qy28bMLIvnoMng8Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

WJ6ESyhtUsrgtgXJgWVGgg	4	2012-01-28 00:00:00	There's some big charm inside the tiny walls of Le Thai. Maybe it's the unassuming red barn-like facade (that finally has a sign!). Or the housewarming like setting. Or the open air patio that is romantically lit with hanging lights. Just as much thought and love was put into the decor of Le Thai as was the food and on Fremont East, this makes all the difference.\n\nLe Thai is indeed tiny and can be hard to maneuver when packed, but when the weather's nice, don't wait for a table inside-opt for the patio. The patio has plentiful seating and has a really nice ambience thanks to the hanging lights and open roof. On chilly nights there are heat lamps, if you're ok sitting next to those.\n\nSetting aside, the food could carry the place by itself. The Thai chicken wings are in my top 5 (watch out Wingstop) and that sriracha ranch-sweet baby Jesus is that stuff addictive. I would drink it if it wasn't looked down upon. The pork jerky comes with this addictive waterfall sauce that is a mix of cilantro, thai chiles, possibly soy sauce, rice vinegar-not really sure. But it's just as addictive as the sriracha ranch and at the risk of not wasting any, I pour whatever sauce is left after I've eaten all of the pork onto my rice. Pad see ew is always my go to and Le Thai does not disappoint!\n\nCocktail-wise I am a huge fan of the Lady Boy-silly name, serious drink. It's made with Thai Whiskey and what I believe is REAL ginger ale (possibly ginger beer?), so it's kind of a sassy twist on a jack and ginger. \n\nMy only dings are for the awkward crampedness when it's busy and the tom kha gai soup which, while the broth was tasty, had an overly abundant amount of sliced mushrooms. Like the packaged kind you get in the store. I've always had it with the little enoki or shiitake mushrooms which both have great texture and better flavor. It's possible I got the other sliced mushrooms since I ordered the vegetarian tom kha gai (with tofu)-maybe they have the more traditional mushrooms with the meat versions. I guess I'll find out next time I go!\n\nLe Thai is a great place to gear up before a long night out on Fremont, a cute place for a date or a final stop for some quality food to soak up the beverages of Fremont.	2	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	DZOA0yCbH4kDS0s-dHXWFg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
WkO7nlKewXxPm6QDZ_VKNQ	1	2015-06-10 00:00:00	Dang I really liked this place the previous two times I was there.  Unfortunately now gets the dreaded one star (I'd prefer to give the hostess one finger!) because the hostess girl was totally clueless.  \n\nWent at about 5:30pm and there was a two top open.  Stood inside the door and she came over and said it would be a minute to get table ready, she then said wait outside.  What?  It was like 105 degrees out!  It wasn't  crowded and we weren't in the way.  I said it's really hot out do you mind if we wait inside?  Her response, "Yes I mind".  Well, ok then I'm outta here.  Went to Bocho around the corner for sushi. \n\nThere are just too many good Thai places in LV to put-up with rude non-sense from a little girl trying to be all tough her in camo pants.	12	6	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Ts5nhdsCkR026l_PjDqdUQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Wq9pWprZiuEpv1P6g0H_Hw	4	2011-11-13 00:00:00	I went to Le Thai at the recommendation of friends and was really glad I did.\n\nThe staff was great, very attentive, refilling my water, and asking me if I wanted more hot water for my tea. They were also very accurate on the heat of the curries (#s 0-5) and describing the specials.   \n\nI had the Tom Ga soup which I would put on the same tasty level as Lotus of Siam's Tom Kah Kai. I also ordered the pork fried rice, it had a nice smokiness to it, so many places create such a bland or oily fried rice, this is one of my benchmark dishes. Next on my list to try is the 3 color curry bowl which I hear is excellent.  \n\nThe smallish menu is nice, not so many overwhelming choices. And with the specials changing regularly, I will still have many options to taste over time.  \n\nThe indoor space is nice, intimate, and clean. There is a large window into the kitchen so you can see the flurry of cooking activity. It was fun speaking with the others diners at their tables, we were sharing opinions on our dishes. I heard nothing but compliments from the other diners.  \n\nI live in the area so I look forward to more dining opportunities.

However the Panang Curry was awesome. You should definitely try the Tom yum  soup - lots of mushroom and very feeding. Spice level just go mild, which I think was a 2 on a 1-5 scale. I still found 2 to be a little hot. Overall def recommended if you're down there.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Q7XZ_vk9NJ2SA__TeC8I5Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
WqkWAMmYt-wkdf08yvgv7w	4	2012-08-27 00:00:00	I like this place. Great food. Great music. Feels like a place you'd come across in a hip mid-size market like Austin. Nice vibe.  It's nice to see food joints open on Fremont.\n\nMinor problem: each time I ask for a 2 out of 5 on the heat scale, it never comes out the same. Sometimes it's barely spicy, sometimes it's face melting. They need to make all the chefs be consistent with each other.\n\nAlso, why is this place not open past 2am on a Saturday night!!!? That's when I could go for some noodles. There's no decent food downtown after hours. They would kill it. If they stayed open a little longer on the weekends.	2	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	LkcrdEk9-SOBbLXt0-Mvwg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It might be because I know what good Thai food tastes like. We ordered:\n\n pad thai - very unusual, tasted okay, looked like a Vietnamese goi (salad)\n\n3 kind curry - this one was pretty good, but really.. how can you mess up curry...\n\nthai beef ball noodle soup - very little soup, soup was very light and bland which isn't supposed to be for this kind of soup, beef slices were over cooked, and way too overpriced. Average price of pho even in sf is like $8.. this bowl was like $11.\n\nTom yum Ca - something like that.... it's the Tom yum with coconut milk and chicken. Tell me why it tastes like they used vinegar to make it sour when they're supposed to used something like tamarind. Tasted like drinking vinegar ....\n\nDefinitely did not like their food.

We actually had lunch here twice during our stay in Vegas. The place is small and usually there was a line forming as we were leaving, so it's probably best to arrive early.\n\nWe both got the Awesome Noodle with tofu on our first visit and it was exactly as the name states: awesome! On our second visit, I tried the Panang Curry. It was very good and a pretty large portion size. I recommend the Spiced Thai Iced Tea as well!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	VcvI71OsOblCdSdC6wf8_A	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

And let's just say it: It was worth the wait. \n\nWhile I've heard service can be slow, I was lucky. Prince was working. Prince knows how to hustle, and how to take care of customers. Prince...is awesome! \n\nBut while good service is always nice, the big bowl of Panang Curry made it worth all the hassle to try and get here for lunch, to find a space in the El Cortez parking garage and run through the casino and all the people just to get a great lunch and then get back in an hour. Yes, it was soooo good and so worth it. \n\nAnd yes, this is the first business that seems to have a tie to Tony Hsieh that didn't suck for me. \n\nWill I be back? Hell yes and I want to bring others. I liked LeThai, and the first impression is that the reviews are not hype, they're legit. \n\nOh and they got the spice just right. Again Thank You Prince for asking the right questions and making sure I was taken good care of. And the Thai Iced Tea was good too. The place is a little intimate when it's busy so it's not for the shy, but the food will make the shy forget about that soon enough. \n\nBut as good as LeThai is...Penns Thai House still kicks LeThai's rear end.

WuGPRHAN2EReKWAYVXCo6g	4	2015-01-12 00:00:00	Great location and pretty good food. We got there around 6 and the place filled up soon after that. We got the Panang Curry, Pad See Ew, and Som Tam. The curry and noodles tasted great. I wasn't a fan of the Som Tam. I ate Som Tam every day for months in Bangkok and it's one of my favorite foods. This one was missing something, it didn't have the balance of spicy, sour, salty, savory, and sweet. It just tasted like spicy papaya - it needed more fish sauce, lime, peanuts, and maybe some dried shrimp and palm sugar. I liked that it came with sticky rice in a small bamboo container.\n\nOverall I would recommend this place if you're staying downtown. Get there early because there was a wait right after we sat down, but I think there was a big party so that may be why. Service was quick and friendly, and I always like when you can see into a restaurant's kitchen - so you know it's clean.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	C77p8jrn8tXkX5MMBUskLg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

If you are unsure about what to order, or a first-time Thai'er, try the Ga Pow. The flavor of this dish is wonderful, even with the bell peppers (and I hate bell peppers)! The mango sticky rice is also an amazing dish, and very satisfying. Prices are reasonable, too.\n\nOn the downside, the place is SMALL so get there early for lunch or dinner, or else suffer a pretty serious wait time. In busy times, the wait service can suffer, but the food more than makes up for it!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ShPNNs-sbMvrjTT0BuPvcA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
WXdjBMM-ZxRBUwxXJ0rqHA	4	2015-10-22 00:00:00	After several visits I have decided to take a few moments to provide my opinion about Le Thai.  This small little restaurant has created many fans on East Fremont in DTLV.  However I am still reluctant to give a five star review.  The flavors of the dishes are awesome Awesome noodle need not be explained.  I Would like more veggies in my dishes besides bean sprouts and green onions but maybe I am thinking of a different type of cuisine. The portions could also be larger especially for the hefty price of $13 a bowl.  That is almost like dining on the strip price and not the East Fremont price.  \n\nWe had a few issues when it came to meal delivery and one of our dishes came out well over 5 minutes after the other three.  Also the first one came out and the temp was a little cold like it had been waiting in the window while the other two were being prepared.  I give this kitchen respect because what they do is not easy.  Cooking for a 50 seat restaurant with two itty bitty woks is not easy especially when you have a party of 10 or larger and you have three To-go orders to make, plus a full bar ordering apps.  It would almost seem impossible to make something like that happen.  I understand you have to work with what you got.  My recommendation would be kitchen expansion if possible. Take the profits from the hefty price of  Pad See Ewe and knock a hole in the wall to the Commonwealth and watch your business grow.  \n\nLe Thai has some great food and some great Happy Hour specials as well.  I will be back my rant is simply the recognition of imperfections in the operation.	2	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I've always gone for lunch and will usually order from their lunch special menu. Come before 11:30pm so you can grab a seat and avoid a 20+ minute wait. Order the lunch special if you want to have a decent entree with a drink for ~$10. For dinner or a weekend lunch, there are better options near Spring Mountain.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	IISdCEnlZEvRl-v2HO6XgA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Every Thai restaurant's bar is set by it's Tom Ka soup and Green Curry, both were amazing. Parking is close and easy, right in the heart of new DTLV.

Several of my friends over the past few years raved about it and knowing that there were foodies as well I decided to give it another try.  I'm glad I did because tonight's experience was awesome . Our server was part of the great experience,  knew the menu , friendly and immediately fixed issue we had . I ordered the pork Larb salad , loved it !!

x215Q8UpErHscwlXTsb3ww	5	2013-06-26 00:00:00	Well then.  Fremont Street and downtown Las Vegas is apparently growing up.  Just a block up from the collection of those classic casinos (Binion's, Four Queens) we see this sleek, practically modern block with craft beer bars, lounges and this Thai restaurant.\n\nThe space is tiny although frees up a bit in the back area.  The bartender gave us great tips on what and how to order (spice level from 0 to 5, and 1 was already making me sweat).  \n\nThe appetizer of Thai Pork Jerky was flavorful, although just a touch tougher than I expected.  The waterfall sauce was refreshing.\n\nThe Short Rib Fried Rice was so good it made me feel zero guilt for indulging in the carbs.  The large serving contained tiny tender pulled short ribs pieces throughout, making every bite luxuriously savory and rich.  It goes right up there with duck fried rice as my favorite Thai creations.  Thanks for making rice so interesting, Thailand!   \n\nThe alcohol selection is small but quirky - particularly a beer each per Asian country.\n\nThe price is eminently reasonable for Las Vegas, being in downtown Vegas and all.  Well worth a trip back for me to dine here, and explore the rest of this burgeoning area.	4	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ypnF_lhgwLAamrE7AN7gDg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

X7wVcKqbTyFtV3EBK_uyPA	4	2014-04-06 00:00:00	Great hole in the wall in the midst of DTLV and always a great end to a crazy pub crawl.  This place definitely has one dope atmosphere!! Although the wait could be ridiculously long at times, I prefer to sit at the back patio especially when the weather is nice out.  With the type of music they play, we always feel as if we're in DTLA every time we eat here.\n\nUnfortunately, food quality has gone down since the restaurant first opened.  I used to think this place has the best Thai food in town but has not been the same lately.  We would frequent here for their short rib fried rice and pad Thai.  The last couple of visits, however, has been quite disappointing with the dishes being quite salty.  Nonetheless, this place has great Thai pork jerky that goes great with the sticky rice.  Their curries are also better than other places in the valley.  Just a note, spicy levels go from 1-5 with 4 being barely tolerable and that's coming from a person who eats a lot of fiery food.  As far as desserts, go for either the mango sticky rice, if available, or the roti.\n\nOverall, Le Thai has become a local favorite due to its food, ambiance, and service.  Great place for quick lunch/dinner, happy hour, or just to sober up after being really intoxicated.	3	0	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
XAQnn_gmVOfevlDBpSvxRg	4	2013-03-02 00:00:00	5 Stars for Service and Location.\n4 Stars for Food\n3 Stars for Price\n4 Stars Overall\n\nThis place has been bookmarked, but always avoided because it's always packed whenever I'm out here.  Because of the long waits, reservations are a must.  This was my first time at Le Thai with zero wait because we had reservations. This also might be due to quiet Thursday night. Met up with the Wonder Twins aka  Alicia R. and Terri R. for dinner.  The restaurant is as small as advertised, but there was plenty of room since it wasn't packed.  We were seated immediately, but felt that our orders took a little longer than I expected since they weren't busy yet. Our orders were eventually taken and we were all given our shots of water. \n\nI ended up ordering their Thai Chicken Wings and Garlic Chicken Fried Rice.  I shared one piece of chicken wings with Alicia R. but had the rest for myself.  You could of have timed me. I killed everything in less than 15 minutes.  The Thai wings were seasoned with what I call a BBQ taste with a sweet happy ending.  Here's the difference with these wings, the taste is on the inside, not the outside.  The initial bite is okay, then you get to the meat where you feel the flavor.  Hard to describe, but imagine BBQ with a sweet buttery after taste.  Yes, it's obvious that I'm a fan of their wings.  Now for their garlic fried rice.  This was so full of flavor and reminded me of what my pops would make.  The serving is huge and might have been made for two, but tonight it was just for me.  The thick pieces of chicken only complimented it. Not saying Le Thai's is better than Dad C.  Just saying, It's damn good.  I finished my meal, Terri R. finished hers, and Alicia R. ate half and boxed the rest. I feel so terrible because I knocked Alicia's food all over the floor while giving her a goodbye hug. Alicia, if you're reading this, I owe you one. \n\nI thought the prices for the wings were about average and the price for the fried rice was a little steep considering it's just fried rice. My pops would never charge me, at least not that much.  My only other issue with price is their $6.50 bottle of Fiji water.  I really wanted a bottle but couldn't justify a bottle costing nearly as much as the wings. So, I settled with their kid's cup of water that they serve. \n\nYou can say I'm a fan of Le Thai.  There's not too many great eats in DTLV at night.  So, location is a definite plus.  Since I tend to take family and out of town friends to downtown, this just might be a perfect stop for some wings, noodles, and fried rice.  However, pops might think differently about the fried rice.\n\nPS:  I forgot to get my free hug for checking in. Good gesture, but no thanks.  I'll save it for last year.	10	9	9	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
XcZ6FtJCSkktqhmEA2BCMg	4	2013-08-17 00:00:00	Came to Le Thai at a friends request for dinner and was so glad I did. The food was delicious! We ordered a variety of food and everything was top notch. I typically go for the pad see ewe but opted instead for the awesome noodles with pork. Its the savory cousin to PSE and didn't disappoint, neither did the chicken satay or the curry. Their spice level for me was spot on. I ordered a 3 and it felt appropriately like a 3, not too spicy with just the right amount of kick.\nAlso another dish that is unique to Le Thai is their short rib fried rice. It was absolutely tasty.\nThe atmosphere here is very nice and fits well with that of other restaurants/bars in the downtown area. Their outdoor seating was pleasant with misters that mist intermittently. I will most definitely be back to Le Thai	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	oknzpMgHOnbijayveG-PKQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
XeOunuQy0k-tZjMg2X6Www	1	2015-12-28 00:00:00	Tonight we made a reservation, and were told it was a 45-minute wait. No problem, we showed up 40 minutes later. Upon our arrival, the hostess was on her phone. After a few minutes, she got off her cell phone and asked why we were there. We told her we had placed a reservation. She said it would be an additional 45 minutes, since we had just arrived. We asked the hostess what was the point of making a reservation, if we had to wait an additional 45 minutes on top of our reserved time. We were told, "That's just the way it is here." I live in New York City, and have never been so offended at a restaurant. Is the food here really that good? There were multiple empty tables when we arrived, so I doubt it.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	YN5hDbzDaoWVXTENS07KFg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Walking into the restaurant off of Fremont St, you feel as if you've been transported to Thailand. The bamboo accents and warm misters are a welcome change from the dry Vegas heat outside. \n\nThe three color curry is their signature dish and a must order!! It is unlikely that you will ever have an opportunity to enjoy such a creative menu item anywhere else. \n\nThe Waterfall chicken, sticky rice and wings rounded out our order wonderfully. \n\nKudos to chef Dan C and his friendly staff. Dinner reservations are recommended.	0	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	Msr9aDm74JzzVPEL00o2YA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

XJxZVJr1Iu0gUOJztzFfmw	1	2013-07-11 00:00:00	Are you kidding me? 5 stars, these people must not eat much Thai food. I've read so many positive reviews about this place we (1 Thai, 1 Cambodian, 1 Chinese and 1 American) finally stopped in to try for ourselves. Wished we hadn't. A 15 minute wait for a table was no problem but having to ask the staff to wipe down the table because of sticky residue was a bad start. We ordered Yellow Curry, Ga Pow, Short Rib Fried Rice and Pad Thai all with chicken, except the fried rice, and degrees of heat from 0-5, 5 still needed more heat. All the chicken in all the dishes dry. The Pad Thai smelled like a wet dog and was overly soggy. The Beef Fried Rice tasted exactly the way my wife makes it using canned corned beef. The Yellow Curry was okay but the dry chicken made it less appetizing. We asked ourselves why is this place so expensive when other places charge 50% less for better quality? And $4 for a soft drink, what gives? For us the #1 Thai restaurant is Lao Thai Kitchen on N. Nellis. Their Saturday lunch buffet for $7.99 has far better tasting dishes like Pad Thai, Ga Pow and Yellow Curry along with chicken wings, Beef with Broccoli, Larb, Green Beans and others. Bonus, kids eat free. But don't take my word for it, go compare for yourself.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	sNqnKBO0r7VlwOr9A-vdaQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It'll give you an estimated wait time, awesome feature. We had to wait a little longer once we arrived, but picked up some $4 PBR cans from the bar window and enjoyed the brisk evening while we waited!\n\nWe shared an appetizer, short rib fried rice, panang curry, and a noodle dish - and everything was excellent. We polished off everything between four people, but definitely left full and happy. My cousins, who were staying in Vegas the whole week, actually went back that week because this place was so yummy. \n\nDo your taste buds a favor and check this place out! It's close to the Fremont Street Experience thing so a great location to kick off an evening of fun downtown (I'd never been to downtown Vegas!).	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	q7IgbnTHCJF5MNAP4hU8yA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

xPzZK6VeyuKdEAIx6tGqMA	3	2013-01-12 00:00:00	My office tried Le Thai the first week it opened and the food was so terrible to this day we call it Le Thai-arrhea.\n\nThe food has improved DRASTICALLY. It's not unique in any way, but it no longer leaves a residue on your teeth or looks like something drained from an infected camel hump as it did the first time I tried it.\n\nNot counting that first week, nothing I've ever had at Le Thai was bad. From the spring rolls, to the curry to the fried rice, everything is perfect and it makes it very difficult to order. I am not a fan of Thai tea, but it is a favorite of almost everyone I know.\n\nThe food is great but the service and management needs major improvement. \n\nFor starters the restaurant is TINY. There is a full bar indoors and a few tables where they try to cram as many people as possible into a very small space. Reminds me of New York City and how so many places just cram diners together. The patio is about double the size as the indoor part. In the summer they use misters and for the cold desert winters they have heating lamps and other heating devices, but you still need a coat. They play good music but is way too loud. I want to eat and have conversation with my dining partners, and better yet, be able to hear my server.\n\nThere are not a lot of places to eat downtown that don't involve walking through a smoke-filled casino, so the wait at Le Thai is LONG. On a Friday night at 7pm, we had to wait an hour and 15 minutes for a table. I heard the hostess tell the people behind us their wait would be two hours.\n\nAnd here's the part that pisses me off. If you have to wait an hour or more Le Thai offers a free round of sake, or even a free bottle. If you have to sit outside in the cold weather, they offer free tea. But your server will never tell you that, nor is it posted in the restaurant. You have to show them you like their facebook page. I can understand if this was a facebook promotion to get more likes, but these freebies are essentially apologies to customers. Shouldn't EVERYONE who has to wait an hour or more or eat outside be allowed to enjoy some sake or tea, and not just their facebook friends? It builds rapport among customers who are social media savvy, but that's a very small set of clientele; not enough to keep your restaurant going.\n\nAgain, food is good, but it's always slow to come out. The server keeps your drinks filled, but slow to take empty dishes away and bring your check. Which is what probably adds to the ridiculous wait times. Their food is a little pricy, but I think their portions are very generous. Enough for two meals.\n\nI go to Le Thai a lot (I work Downtown so about 1-2 times a month) and always send out of town guests there, but my experience last night was incredibly annoying. It included the manager telling our server to serve her table of friends before us (even though we were seated probably 10-20 minutes before them). And their response to my questioning why our server didn't tell us about the free tea and sake when we waited more than an hour and were seated outside was rude and obnoxious. \n\nI probably will take a little Le Thai break. I did that when their food was disgusting and it improved. Hopefully the same will happen with their service and management.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ST74s3O3TGREMDHQWMFNQg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Was told a twenty minute wait, but then offered a spot in the back garden along the wall seating.  No problem for me, and I actually liked the ambiance of the back garden versus the front dining area.\n\nServer was prompt and friendly, and offered to check if their sake was gluten-safe.  The only one confirmed was the Tyku sakes (cucumber or coconut).  I know their products quite well, but even though I was not really in the mood for cold, flavored, sake - I opted for the cucumber.  Good choice.  It was refreshing with a subtle flavor that was actually quite complimentary to the heat of the entree.\n\nOrdered the pad thai with chicken.  It had a great flavor and good amount of heat and spice (I went for 3/5).  \n\nService was good although there was another server either taking over or helping out in the section?  That made it a bit confusing but they were both very friendly and prompt.  Price seemed a bit high for noodles and booze for two, but hey, it's LV.\n\nWould definitely thai this place out again.	0	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	0IdfzFwxhtQd0Trs5DWWSw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

It is the gosh-darn BEST Thai food in Vegas (and pretty much best anywhere I've been since Thailand! Lol!) Had my favorite "Drunken Noodles" and I always order that at Thai places and these are simply the best! You get a great-sized portion too! Also had the Yellow Curry with tofu and it was equally as delicious!! Washed it all down with the Happy Hour menu (3pm-6pm Mon-Fri) The Singha beer(s) topped off our delightful Thai food experience! We had great service even though they got busy during our time here they did great! I highly recommend this place when in Vegas!	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	0PDuIlK-VLy3oZNngNeaWQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

When we were told by the hostess of the wait time, we decided to not wait and to go to another restaurant.  As soon as we declared this, the staff intercepted my mother in law and told her that the restroom was for customers only...\n\nWTF....  What kind of customer service is this????  \n\nBoycott Le Thai!!!	4	1	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	9Y0EKbjL1t_Uqj8uTHxGnw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
yBLd7jOHUYROVNbFR9kLjw	3	2016-06-29 00:00:00	Me and my husband ate here three years ago and couldn't wait to return on our trip back to Vegas. Last time we were not that hungry and were super bummed we wasted the good leftovers...\nThis past experience was way different. We showed up and the hostess informed us she had a 45min wait just to be put on a wait list? Who does that? Why can't you just put everyone on a wait list and give a realistic wait time. I felt like she didn't want our business. She did however inform us that we can do take out so we decided to take that route. We went to the take out counter and again the guy said it would take 45min for take out in a tone that kinda made me feel like they didn't want our business. I told him it's fine and we put in our order and went to the bar next door which was actually really cute and I loved the atmosphere. We got back to our hotel room and the food was piping hot which was nice. The spring rolls were really yummy, the chicken pad Thai ordered at a level 2 was too spicy for my and besides the spice it didn't have much flavor, the noodles looked whiteish and I remember it being more red last time so that was a super disappointment. The short rib fried rice was actually really good and they use real short rib meat it was super yummy. My husband liked the pad Thai and I liked the rice. The food is good but probably not the best Thai I have ever eaten. The reason for the three stars is the management needs to get their staff on a better program for wait times and maybe teach them a thing or two about customer service. I forgot to mention we asked if we could make a reservation for a later day and she said they only do that for large parties. It's just ridiculous to be so vague about when you can actually sit and feed someone. We may come back and give it another shot next time but only because my husband likes it.\n\nTHIS IS MY UPDATE to management response:\nDan and Shauna,\nI feel like you got defensive instead of apologetic and didn't thoroughly read my review let me be clear.\n1. Your hostess told me and the people before me we would have to come back in 45 minutes to be put on the wait list. She wouldn't even put us on a wait list. I would have been fine if she said I can put you on a wait list but it's a two and a half hour wait but she suggested we come back in 45min just to be put on a wait list this was my complaint...\n\n2. She also informed me that she would take reservations but only for parties of six or more. \n\nClearly there is miscommunication between management and staff. I wouldn't pull this outta nowhere it's the truth and my experience and a simple apology would have sufficed. Thank you.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	yEBDGvRaTlOEXfjUhV3knw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
yBLU-pRYfPqo8AR_U2ig8g	4	2016-07-06 00:00:00	We fell in love with the place last year. My husband and I were in town from Scotland and found this hole in the wall spot. And so this year, we decided, it would be awesome to take his parents and some of our friends because we had such a great time before. I called prior to arriving as instructed and phones kept getting cut off and the waitlist couldn't be confirmed. Called back three times and no avail. BUT we decided to go anyway. We got there, got to the host stand, and the hostess (thankfully) accommodated us. I gave it four stars because of the whole waitlist thing and the food seemed rush. Our waitress was nice but they only checked on us once.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	uBg9yAxT1JBMS2kYPykilw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

yCOCdmZtXTnVBWVRBTrsAA	2	2013-10-12 00:00:00	Our experience began well enough. Hostess used her phone to manage the list. Quoted 35 min and she would text us. We went off to Walgreens and just generally  walking around the area. Overall,that section of Fremont is much improved. \n\nWhen we got back close to the time, I watched her seat a couple who had checked in after us but was seated at the bar. When I asked about that I was met with an indignant sarcastic remark. I watched others struggle with the seating process as well. Same MO. Confusion,cattiness,poor show to guests.  Yes...you are busy now. Good luck when you are not.\n\nThis situation could have been alleviated by a few easy words... 'I'm sorry. I made a mistake.I will get you the best table I have next'. Instead, crappy bar seat. Bar shakes constantly. \n\nWait staff lovely and food good.  Really would have loved to spend my whole time raving about them but the seating process and attitude I was met with were a total turn off.\n\nStick w Lotus of Siam. Their seating process is fair and lacks the drama of le thai's.  their food is better too. Advise to call ahead.	1	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	fpXCN2RsFpQL-0aceAAaIA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
yDSpvTXUZPqTtP1_K0WbsA	3	2014-12-09 00:00:00	I've wanted to try this place forever! I love Thai food and the downtown vibe. I thought going in that this place would be worthy of a a 5 star review, but the lack of service killed the experience completely.\n\nIt was a Thursday night around 7pm. We were seated in the back part of the restaurant and given menus. Joel and I decided we would share our dishes since we wanted to try the same things. We waited probably 15 minutes and no one had come by. No drink order, nothing. The waiter and waitress continued to walk right by us and not even look at us. Finally when the waiter walked by I asked him if we could order. He said " our waitress was really busy that's why she hadn't come by, but that he would take our order." I ordered the Short Rib Fried Rice with an egg on top at a level 3. Joel ordered his favorite, Pad See Ew with pork at a level 2. The food took a lot longer then expected. I was hungry and wished we'd ordered an appetizer. I started noticing other tables that had come in after us getting their food. Weird. Finally out came our order! Mine was very tasty. It had chunks of short rib and the spice level was perfect. Next time I wouldn't spend the extra $1.50 for the egg on top. I was expecting it to be runny so I could mix it into the rice, but that egg was hard as a rock and did nothing for the dish. Joel's Pad See Ew was more broccoli then noodles, but still had a great flavor. \n\nThe decor is very minimum, but they do need to kick the heat lamps down a bit. We were sweating up a storm and not just from the spicy food. I had high hopes for Le Thai, but with that service I'll spend my money somewhere else downtown. Sorry Le Thai you lost me.	5	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

yJf3ULAnW1QObDmE6VfRKA	3	2012-05-13 00:00:00	When you first walk in it's a small seating area - but if you're one of the lucky ones you'll sit in the back where it's open to the outdoors.  Very cool.  We were seated quickly and was again quickly accommodated when we added three more people to our table.  Understandably it was a monday night but there is no recession here.\n\nOur server took our order on her iPhone which was way cool.  Unfortunately, one would think that this would prevent mistakes and/or lost orders but not so much.  We ordered the awesome noodles with chicken.  I wish I took a picture.  We tried to order another as there were 6 of us now but after two attempts it just never came.\n\nWe ordered other dishes which were good but the awesome noodles stands out so much it's hard to talk about anything else.  The flat rice noodles were incredibly fresh and the flavor has the perfect amount of slightly sweet soy sauce and spice.\n\nJust a note that their spice level is on the high side.  I ordered it mild and asked for the dry spices on the side for extra flavor.\n\nvenue - 4\nfood - 3.5\nservice - 2\nprices - 3	3	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	kVAy8nol_GefMbR7awm5TA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

We went during a very beautiful day and sat outside which was perfect, it's a very cute outside patio. Service was very friendly and fast.

The short rib fried rice with waterfall sauce was always the big draw. This year they lost our business. We made a reservation and when we got there at the specified time the hostess said it would be a 35 minute wait because we hadn't "checked in." One person from our party had gone in to use the bathroom and said he saw about 10 open tables inside. I don't know what kind of a place refuses to seat a party of 7 at the time of their reservation, especially when there are available tables, but we didn't stick around to find out. We went next door to La Comida instead and had a great time.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	3bumqqaS8-tk05gC21W0pQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

yMTrcGERY96A8yVdAoSiSw	5	2012-12-24 00:00:00	Just thinking about his place brings a smile to my face and a gurgle to my tummy.  From the excellent appetizers:  The wings are delicious, the Waterfall Beef is extraordinary, the Thai Jerky is sublime,  to name a few.  \n\nFor the lunch specials, I recommend the tri-color curry or the basil bowl (i order it without the fried egg on top, as the fried egg on top is not my thing).  Both the Thai tea and coffee are over-sized and tasty.  The service is good, and everyone in the joint is pretty and friendly.  \n\nNOW for the best part:  It is in the heart of downtown near what was once a deplorable wreck of a street!  The ambiance in this place is superb, as you step off of Fremont into a niche of breezy cool!  I have sat both indoors and out, and been pleased by either location.  It gets a bit crowded at lunch time, but the setup still leaves you feeling like you have room to breathe.  \n\nThe only complaint I have is that the heat has been inconsistent in the food.  I have had a weak 4 (they have a 1-5 heat scale) and a BLAZING 4.  \n\nCheck it out and enjoy some awesome Thai, and be part of the "new cool" that Downtown Vegas is becoming.	0	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	JECVipu_fSuvA4ckqskYXw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
YoYBAUDVRGSuORPXFQrdVQ	5	2012-07-04 00:00:00	Upon entering Le Thai for the first time, I was just blown away. I immediately felt like I was taken to another country!! I couldn't believe this restaurant was in Vegas because it reminded me of some places I have been to in Asia. It was a pretty small place and very packed. We were seated in the outdoor patio, which was very very cool. I loved the ambiance out there. There was even a DJ playing some deep house which definitely set the mood for our dinner. \n\nFor my entree, I ordered a Thai Beef and Meatball soup with a spice level 3 out of 5. I would have gotten a 4 or 5 but I have been warned ahead of time that their dishes were very very spicy. When I got my soup, it definitely had some kick. I would say it was realistically an 8 out of 10 on the spice scale. This soup was absolutely delicious. It was just so flavorful and they definitely did not cheap out on the meat. The pieces of beef were very chunky and meaty and very tender. \n\nMy experience at Le Thai was amazing. I'm so happy that this place is in Las Vegas and I can drive 20 minutes to have this not so ordinary dining experience.	2	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	e9wfoS-pYUNrloa6VZBgNw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
Yp02M97XGpSOChtI--w-Aw	1	2015-09-12 00:00:00	I have been eating at Le Thai for the past 2 years. The food has always been great as well as the service. I've never felt the need to review this place before until last night. You can see they have new employees as I've stated I've  been going here for 2 years. Last night my BF friend and I came in sat down at the bar at about 10:15pm. There were two other sitting at the bar as well finishing up their meal. I won't name names because I don't like doing that so I will say the female bartender took our drink order then we waited and waited. 15 minutes later the male bartender had to re take our order. So about 20 minutes now we finally received our drinks and we ordered our food. The food is always great so no complaints there this is strictly a review on their customer service. The bartenders were rude inexperienced and continued to have an attitude not only with us but the people that kept coming to the side window to order from the bar. The female bartender at one point actually closed the window on someone who was asking her questions about the menu! Unprofessional all the way around. Every time we placed an order they would do 100 other things including checking their cell phones and then remember what we ordered when they would turn and see our faces.. We finally got out of there around  1140 or so and that's because the male bartender of course forgot to put in our order for the fried banana's. Oh and the best part they gave us the wrong bill which was WAY lower than what we ordered. Guess they got ours mixed up with all those window orders they were mad about taking! Lol we usually would of brought the mistake up to the manager when this situation happens however based on their horrible customer services skills and not paying attention to what they are doing because they wanted to complain the whole time they deserve to have their register short and get reprimanded about it. I'll be back to Le Thai because the food is great but we'll take a table next time of the same bartenders are there.	0	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	A6tj6_AmjtAEaoOnwVSMTw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

I love that their menu isn't huge and that I will actually be able to try everything on the menu if I spread it out between about 5 visits or so.\n\nPanang curry is the best I've had so far. Drunken noodles were great, better than the Awesome noodles and those are pretty darn good too. Can't go wrong with either. The Thai iced tea is perfect and this appetizer called Waterfall beef was kinda nostalgic of a Cambodian beef dish my mom use to make. My version of comfort food. It comes with this addicting waterfall sauce. From what I can make of it, it consists of at least fish sauce, lime, sugar and green onions. Love that stuff! \n\nRestaurant is a bit small and service is kinda slow but that won't stop me from coming back.	2	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	S2tfbnjoCzMX0U0B_cTXVw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

yYIm5y7R_BpMwVlun41Agg	5	2012-09-18 00:00:00	I am a Tripadvisor reviewer but I had to use my first Yelp review on Le Thai!  It is muy le delicious!  I was in Vegas for a long weekend recently with a buddy of mine and we wanted to venture off of the tourist area and find something local.  We didnt have to venture far.  We literally stumbled across Le Thai and we were not disappointed.  I can honestly say that the meal I had at Le Thai ranks in the top three meals I ever ate.  In fact, I am hoping for a cheap flight back to Las Vegas....not for the gambling and drinking but to make it back to Le Thai.  I will always recommend this place to everyone I know that will be visiting Las Vegas.  A must go if you live in town or are visiting.	2	0	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	iUnEFvoIBn8JcXg_6E9b1w	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

There is inside seating as well as outdoor. There is almost always a wait every time I come- call ahead (esp. If you are ordering takeout). I ordered the Pad Thai- large portion size, even for the lunch special.	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	sWupZi-am9yrHpIpcCC2kA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Z2LpyGlMOzSqTb-DJAxYxA	3	2012-05-07 00:00:00	A friend of mine suggested this place for dinner one night.  We had a group of 8 or 9 and this place is really really small.  Luckily they have a nice patio area with heat lamps so they set us up outside.  The food was OK...not the best Thai I'd ever had and I feel that was the general opinion of the group.  It was a bit pricey for what it was and where it was located though.  I would go back in a group setting if other people wanted to go but Vegas has way too many good restaurants to eat a place that is just OK.	1	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	ajxohdcsKhRGFlEvHZDyTw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
z4GgSvbByG9OJla_6X5a2A	2	2015-12-27 00:00:00	I'm giving this two stars not based on the food, simply because I only come here for two dishes. But for the attempt of getting their loyal customers in their door. I come here quite often as I live across the street so naturally it's just easy to walk there and considering there are not many choices downtown. On multiple occasions I've walked in and they tell me the wait is 45- to an hour. Twice I have gone to open a tab at the Griffin and they text me letting me know my table is ready within fifteen minutes after I was told 45-an hour. My other awful experience was when I did a pick up order and SPECIFICALLY said please give me an accurate time for my food to be ready so I can get it while it's hot, I arrive there to get my food and the gentleman tells me it has been ready for twenty minutes. Or tonight I was told an hour and fifteen minutes for a wait in this place. I hope that their hostesses / host can get a good gauge on timing because they're just turning away local customers.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	iPLOrkNgEncuRVZPoPpU0w	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

There have been so many reviews of this place, I won't go too long.\n\n* The pork jerky is unique & amazing.  Served with a "pot" of sticky rice, though a lowly appetizer, it is a meal unto itself.  The waterfall beef is just as good, only, it is from a cow...\n\n* The Thai Style Wings (with sriracha ranch) are the best wings downtown.  Period.\n\n* Their Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles) is the definition of what a spicy noodle dish should be.  Lots of everything: flavor, protein, noodles, & spice.\n\n* My recent discovery is the garlic fried rice.  I am big on garlic & this dish is HUGE on flavor.\n\nThe portions are generous, service at the bar, where I usually sit at lunch or late nights, is always good.  The Thai Iced Coffee is flavorful & strong.\n\nThe only issue is their popularity.  On weekends, it can be an hour wait, even at midnight.  \n\nChances are, on a Friday late night, I'll be at the bar, wolfing down something while the band is on a break.\n\nENJOY!	3	1	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	K2-KRkqecWxmwqPHQWVZbA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
z88lMbzzaY4xEPx57Tl97Q	4	2015-04-18 00:00:00	Le Thai is a very popular Thai restaurant located downtown on Fremont St, well known by many. No surprise that there's usually is a wait for this reason. \n\nThe dishes here are pretty tasty!! I wouldn't say Le Thai is THE go to place for authentic Thai cuisine but the food here is flavorful so I can definitely understand why people rave about it.\n\nI've tried their Chicken Pad Thai, Beef Pad See Ewe, Short Rib Fried Rice, and Yellow Chicken Curry. Everything was very good but their Pad Thai wasn't my favorite. There were a few odd ingredients... a lot of shredded carrots and cilantro which isn't normally in Pad Thai. They may have tried to make a signature infused Le Thai version of Pad Thai but I much rather prefer the traditional. \n\nService is not bad for being so busy! I can't recall anything negative. Friendly and my water was never empty... \n\nI would choose more of an authentic Thai restaurant if I wanted Thai, however, I would recommend Le Thai if you're craving Asian food while downtown!	2	0	3	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Ze09StNs6TEFlScgQejPCA	4	2013-11-07 00:00:00	Le Thai offers solid Thai food with a nice beer garden atmosphere in down town Las Vegas. \n\nMy favorite offering on the menu is the waterfall beef and sticky rice which you can order discounted on the happy hour menu. \n\nThis place is notable because you can have a nice beerlao! This is the number one national product of Laos. If Thai people are proud and speak highly of their king, Lao people share the same reverence for their beer.\n\nIf it isn't happy hour I order the ga pow, Thai chicken basil.  \n\nAhroy maak!	3	4	4	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	0ZrfHMZ4EaXP9zR6AFd7CA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

ZgdnYSMqsfaNY22VOcG9rA	4	2016-08-15 00:00:00	Solid 4 stars to me , kinda pricey for what it is (like more expensive than other Thai places that are just as good) but you can't go wrong eating here if you're in downtown.\n\nThis time my friend and I sat at the bar and received great service from Ashley. Plus we got to watch the game as well on their flat screen tv. I would describe this place as very hip and cozy. Not many indoor seating. There's an outdoor area but it's way too hot right now to be out there and suffering XD.\n\nThai food is absolutely my favorite cuisine. I could eat it everyday. Their short rib fried rice is phenomenal ! At first , I was skeptical ordering it because I thought it would be just plain fried rice , but everyone there kept insisting us to try it and I'm glad they did. I have also tried their three color curry , spicy eggplant , Thai style wings , and pad Thai so far. Everything here is great but their short rib fried rice was definitely my favorite out of all. Get their Thai iced tea to accompany your meal (they even have spiked Thai iced tea).\n\nI'm a fire eater so I always like ordering a 5 out of 5 spice level , but to spare my friend I got a 4 instead (but he was still dying :P). So I would suggest ordering a "2" if you just want medium spice.\n\nTip: Only street parking 2$/hour meters.	4	1	3	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	qtOCfMTrozmUSHWIcohc6Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Zia7Lg-GY6jBzaPFtDG5eA	1	2012-02-24 00:00:00	I have read so many great reviews about this place and heard so many people praise it.  I tried it twice.  \nI want to start by saying that the atmosphere and location are prime.  This restaurant is in a cool area and has a good vibe.\n\nBut as an objective eater I must say that Le Thai sucks.  \n\nThe first time my girlfriend and I ordered take out.  I ordered the Tom Kha and my girlfriend ordered the tri-curry.  You're going to slice up crappy ass button mushrooms and put it in my soup??  Seriously?  Is there even a Thai restaurant in town that tries to pull that crap?  My soup looked like a warm bowl of milk with some sliced packaged mushrooms from Albertson's.  And then am I supposed to think that it's spicey?  I ordered a spice level of 4 out of 5.  Next time I will order a 57.  I prefer when Thai restaurants are on the spicy side.  I dont want the waiter or chef to decide what they think I can handle and then end up giving me the equivalent of Ketchup.  The tri-curry was also about as good as a can of SpaghettiOs.  \n\nSince first impressions are not always the best, we tried it again tonight and decided to dine in.  We saw the server a total of once, when he took our order.  Luckily we saw the bus boy 3 times so that he could ask us to clear the table for him, to get a box and to get us the check.  Oh, and to take my credit card.  Horrible service with no explanation or apologies.\nThe order was wrong too, I asked for a curry with NO onion and got a bowl full of them.  Maybe that is why the server literally never came back to see how our dinner was.  \n\nI cannot fathom why anybody who lives in Las Vegas would rate this Thai restaurant even mediocre with the amount of great or even good Thai restaurants all around us.  It's cool that we got a new ethnic restaurant downtown and all but shouldn't we want them to be good too?  A crappy restaurant is bad business for redevelopment.  I hope they improve soon.\n\n---------------------------\n\nSince this review the owner contacted me directly to offer his genuine apologies and even offered to cook me a meal personally.  Although I politely declined I thought this was a very nice gesture that indicates that they are really trying to improve and make everybody happy.  You cant make everybody happy, but based on his reaction alone I would not discourage other people from giving it a try to see for themselves.	8	0	3	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	QMYpUNwFLKFFWLdFZ0VAJg	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
ZJ841y6r55vawFJFvNJ_yQ	3	2017-04-21 00:00:00	It's not as great as the hip and trendy young people who hang out downtown say it is, lol.\nI ordered the fried rice and was VERY disappointed as the menu said "combination fried rice $11 add shrimp $13" so I thought that meant chicken, pork, and shrimp so I ordered the $13 one. Nope. Just shrimp. No chicken or other meats. Maybe it was just me but I found that very misleading. The portion was about half of what an authentic Thai restaurant would give you.\nI ordered the spring rolls which were fine, but tasted exactly like Panda Express eggrolls. \nI also got the Thai iced tea which was great but a little more expensive than other places.\n\nI spent $27 on small portioned food. The flavor is good, nothing incredible, but I wouldn't come back. This spot is more "trendy" than authentic. Pass.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	TXZRWst2LMfaKRGF4DAxDA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The entire bill was about $80 but consisted of 3 drinks, larb, awesome noodles, chicken wings, cucumber salad, and a Thai omelette. Considering the location, this price is very reasonable. The drinks were very solid and the spice level, though not overwhelming, was quality. If you can stand the wait of 30 minutes at all times of the night, I recommend coming here. Not the best Thai food in the city but quite good.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

All the flavors from the dishes aforementioned was on point, like it hit the spot!!!  The restaurant is a bit small when you walk in. We were seated outside, the atmosphere was inviting and calm.

ZkttSoFgIMOlMIXmerXKwA	4	2015-07-16 00:00:00	Atmosphere: \nLocated on Fremont (eastside). We showed up on one of those 110 degree summer days and were sat outside where the mist fans were. (Humid hotspot) Luckily I'm used to the humid weather being from TN but I can see where it might be an issue for some.\nWe showed up for an early dinner and were seated immediately.\n\nFood:\n I like a kick with my thai food and when it comes to Thai food I see restaurants rate their spiciness level on two scales. People who know Thai spice and people who don't. This is definitely a place that uses the level for people that don't. We ordered a dish with a heat level of "3" which I believe was "hot" but it honestly wasnt bad at all.\n\nAs far as the overall food discussion goes - this is one of the best thai places I've been to that is able to cater to both those who love thai good and those that are just trying it for the first time.\n\nWe ordered some Thai style wings and these were probably some of the best wings I have ever had. I'd like to think of myself as a wing junkie and these are definitely a must-try.\n\nI got the pad see ewe at a "3" and taste wise it was great. Spice wise I needed to add more to get the kick I wanted.\n\nWe also ordered the red curry at a "2" and my girlfriend loved it. - She definitely avoids the spice but she also said she could've kicked it up a bit.\n\nThe drinks were strong. The ice melted extremely quick so after about 5mins it was watered down but thats not their fault.\n\nService:\nI've read in previous reviews that there was a common issue with a hostess however our hostess sat us immediately and we didn't have an issue at all with her.\n\nOur waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and our food came out quickly.\n\nOverall:\nI will definitely make another trip here when I'm out in Vegas again. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat.	1	0	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	l5cxtEb38HqqSqXJdG1_lw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The indoor is very inviting, and the covered courtyard in the back is a wonderful place for a date night.  Highly recommended.  \n\nAlso, as a side note, many in their reviews have noted that servers were on their smart phones.

ZRdeSRqxqGW7xglMhD1ezQ	4	2013-07-13 00:00:00	After two visits, this is definitely our FAVORITE Thai restaurant right now. My first visit was on 04/12/2013 and I was expecting a lot since I read all the raving reviews on Yelp and fortunately, it delivered. We tried their Chicken Pad Thai, 3 Color Curry, and (Minced) Pork Pad Kee Mow. \n\nThe Pad Thai was honestly not my favorite preparation of this classic dish, but it was still tasty. The 3 Color Curry was so much fun! It's "Le Thai's special blend of red, yellow and green curry and all its vegetables" which includes Bamboo shoot, bell pepper, Thai basil, potato, onion, and carrots in coconut milk. The flavor was obviously unique and well done. I don't care for potatoes in my curry, so next time, I'll stick with my favorite, red curry. Now, the Pad Kee Mow was out of this world. Top 10 favorite dish of all time (I don't have an official Top 10 list, but if I did, it would be on there somewhere). I mean, SOO DELICIOUS! I'm not even a big Pad Kee Mow fan and have never been, so this changed my life.\n\nOn my second visit (04/21/2013) with friends, we tried the Short Rib Fried Rice (Pulled beef from short rib stir-fried with waterfall sauce, egg, garlic, yellow and green onion, topped with cilantro) and of course, I ordered the Pork Pad Kee Mow again, Thai Salad (Grilled beef or chicken with red and green onion, tomato and cilantro mixed with lime juice and Thai chili), and Green Curry. This trip solidified my love for the place and its Pad Kee Mow. Perfection in a bowl. The salad was okay, not something for me in the flavor department.\n\nThe restaurant itself is cool, the outside/inside dining is cozy (but loud on weekend nights). Service is just okay. Nothing amazing, but not horrible. The wonderful food more than makes up for it. Honestly, I can't think about anything else but that delicious Pork Pad Kee Mow. Eat it. Oh, and spice levels aren't playing around. I wish I could remember what level I ordered because I definitely need to take it down a notch. I sweated...and it wasn't because of the weather.	2	2	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
ZrF16OgtF3sW18G4DwwYxQ	2	2016-07-09 00:00:00	I had heard of the long waits because of the lack of table space, but I thought a 10PM dinner might make the wait time a little more reasonable. I was wrong. It took 40 minutes just to get inside. When we did finally enter the restaurant, we realized that there was a large patio out the back - easily three times the size of the dining space inside - with no less than 5 open tables. \n\nThe food - for all the hype - was mediocre. The chicken satay was pretty good - well-seasoned and juicy - but the pad see eau was far too sweet instead of savory as it should be, and the waterfall beef was flavorless. The portion sizes were good, but there wasn't much to write home about. \n\nThere aren't many places in downtown Las Vegas to grab Thai at, and with decent prices, I can see why people would consider it an alright place to eat. However, for a better dining experience and superior food, I would highly recommend bypassing Le Thai in favor of one of the many Archi's restaurants around town and avoid this tourist trap.	2	2	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	pcv-MEpcI6t4_ytr49LFpw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The pad Thai tastes sweet than I thought, and has strong fish sauce flavor in it. It's taste better when it's still warm. The red curry has strong creamy coconut milk flavor that perfectly matches with curry paste. The curry taste little spicy but mild. Last, the mango sticky rice that also has coconut condensed milk on the top of sticky rice. The side of mongo works to fresh the dish and create well balance.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	jI6YD3XhkgfjlbMnVE6NcA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

The food took 30 minutes, like they said it would. Food should've been in bigger portions for the prices they were (-1 star).

zypb7S3mUwN3M4tz2sO07g	3	2014-02-07 00:00:00	I was looking for a place that provided a good vegan option, and my friends and I all wanted something on the inexpensive side.\nThey seated us at the edge of the room where the entire wall is partially open to the bitter cold outside (so your head is warm, but your legs are freezing). Although there were heat lamps, the walls were just counter-intuitive. \nI ordered the vegan curry, which I was very excited to see on the menu, AND with an option of chicken, beef, pork, or tofu. Now of course, I assumed this would be VEGAN, FAUX chicken/beef/pork, because why in the world would someone offer REAL MEAT with VEGAN curry?? Especially since I explicitly told the waitress that I didn't eat meat. So I ordered the vegan curry- chicken. Although my friend didn't like it, I thought the curry tasted fine.. until I started chewing on the meat which tasted like blood/iron and sinew so I asked the waitress who, only AFTER I ordered and tried it, let me know that it's NOT vegan. All four of us at the table were completely dumbfounded as to why anyone would offer "Vegan Curry" on the menu to have non-vegan meat in it?? And to not even be clear about that?? And when the waitress was told that the particular customer doesn't eat meat?? IMAGINE THAT. I don't get disturbed easily, but I was very disturbed after biting into flesh after being vegetarian for 7 years. That was $13 down the drain for me.\nI'm grudgingly giving 3 stars because my friends did enjoy their beef fried rice, and maybe the waitress had a long day. But all in all, what a ridiculously counter-intuitive place.	2	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	90Go9OZhKs-5jpagYY8N3Q	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

From the decor to the food, I could swear I was invited to eat at someone's home. What we ordered:\n\n- Spring Rolls - Light and crispy. The sweet chili sauce was the perfect accompaniment\n\n- Tom Ka Soup with Tofu - By far the best Tom Ka I've had. The coconut was a nice cooling factor against the heat of the spice and the freshness of the lemongrass. Perfection!\n\n- Awesome Noodles - Perfect name for the perfect noodle dish. I ordered it with chicken and with an over medium egg on top. This is a must try!\n\n- Fried Bananas - Pretty standard. It was good, but I don't think you could really mess this up. It was light and crispy. Only thing I would've changed is if it came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \n\nLe Thai is a must try!	3	1	1	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	btk3ZCxMwLxVU5iQNJ8JNA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
_CPxN6wObWxNlMAzaMryJQ	4	2015-02-26 00:00:00	We came here for an early dinner while on vacation in Vegas because I read somewhere to ignore the hype about Lotus of Siam (a favorite of some celebrities and the well-known downtown stalwart of Thai food) and come here instead. Le Thai is trendy but laid-back casual, and the food is spot-on.\n\n(I also was a little turned off by the tiny portion sizes at Lotus of Siam - I know it's not all about size but I was really hungry this day.) Also, the fact that it's open all day and doesn't close between lunch and dinner is great. \n\nAll of us are picky about our Thai food (both my friends have traveled to Thailand) and we were completely satisfied and happy here. We just missed the lunch special which seemed like a great deal ($10 for a shorter menu of curries, stir-frys, etc. + a drink) but right in time for happy hour (drinks and most of the appetizers are half-off). The Thai Tea was huge and delicious.\n\nOur waitress recommended a number of dishes but we went with the happy hour Chicken Satay (served with fantastic peanut sauce and a really nice fresh cucumber salad), the chicken 3 Color Curry (blend of red, green, and yellow) and Short Rib Fried Rice. We shared all of it between the three of us and took lots of leftovers home, so even though it's pricier than some Thai places, the portion sizes are generous.\n\nOkay, it all was freaking amazing. The chicken satay came with 4 or 5 meaty skewers (none of those anorexic chicken pieces at some Thai places). The curry ($12) had all the flavor and heat that we were looking for and a nice ratio of chicken and veggies to sauce. We debated for too long about what heat-rating to give it because we like some heat (nose-running is good) but don't want to have to stop eating it - our waitress said that curry is always 1-2 ratings higher than what you order, so she suggested a 0 (I know, what??) but it was perfect.\n\nThe real show-stopper was the Short Rib Fried Rice (pulled beef from short rib stir-fried with waterfall sauce, egg, garlic, yellow and green onion and topped with cilantro, $13.50). I know this probably isn't true Thai cuisine, but it was TO DIE FOR. Perfectly tender short rib chunks, awesome fried rice, not too saucy, not too salty, amazing flavor explosions. Whatever waterfall sauce is, it is delicious (savory but with a little punch of smoky sweet). We took leftovers home and it maybe was even better the next time we ate it. I'm craving it right now and wish they could deliver it to Salt Lake. \n\nSmall dining room but there's a patio out back and plenty of seating (about 10 tables total and two counters plus the bar seating.) We had no wait but we were dining early for dinner at 3:30pm. It filled up slowly as the afternoon wore on - tables are a bit close together FYI. Seemed very clean, fun to watch the cooks through the window and the bartender at the bar. I know some have complained about the service, but we had great service, food arrived quickly but not too fast, refills were prompt. Our only beef was that when the waitress packaged up our leftovers, she didn't include the peanut dipping sauce for the remaining chicken satays - so sad.\n\nParking is a bit tricky as there are few spaces on Fremont - some metered parking on the side streets, but the neighborhood is a little sketchy even though it's improved quite a bit, so I wouldn't want to walk alone at night. \n\nSo glad we skipped the crowds on the Strip. I would come here again in a heartbeat.	1	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	TKCHM6c8o3tHj346BBG5tw	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Tried the daily special which was crab fried rice & the Pad Thai with beef. I really liked that you could choose your spice level on everything so for me it was perfect.

_F4cT_08vnXW3pG9Ih_ubw	5	2014-03-26 00:00:00	The best Thai food I've ever had. \n\nNo joke.\n\nEVER.\n\nWhen I heard there was a 60 minute wait on a Monday night in Downtown, I thought "you gotta be kidding me?"\n\nBut a large format bottle of sake quickly mollified me.  Besides, you can get anything off the menu from the to-go window outside,  so 15 minutes later I was eating a couple appetizers.  There weren't many vegetarian options, so I ordered spring rolls with GREAT trepidation, because, are spring rolls EVER good?  No!   They are NEVER, EVER good.  They're only occasionally not terrible.  They're like the Thai equivalent of mozzarella sticks.\n\nExcept at this place.  These weren't just not terrible, they were TERRIFIC.  As in, has every other spring roll I've ever had prior just been deep fried crab grass?  Because THESE were golden, crispy PERFECTION.  They were like MDMA dipped in cocaine served on a silver salver of multiple orgasms.\n\n\nFor my main course I had a level 3 yellow curry.  Pretty much my go to order at an unfamiliar Thai restaurant.    Except, now, having eaten their yellow curry, I don't think I will EVER be able to go-to another yellow curry again.  This yellow curry was so fucking amazing that my taste buds will probably go all Norma Rae on my mouth if ever attempt to feed them anything but this sweet, spicy, NECTAR OF THE GODS.\n\nThe service was likely very good and the decor was probably too, but I really can't say for sure because I spent the next hour basically awash in serotonin and dopamine. \n\nThey should be handing out cards to this place on the Strip along with those glosssy pictures of strippers and escorts.	6	7	6	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	uhOmmaB3qFi-QsPfQKg3ww	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

But never go for spice level 5 you would be in fumes But still taste good though. The wait time is bit long but they keep you well informed. The best thing would be to call well in advance and reserve. Staffs are super friendly and make you feel comfortable. The wait time for food is not more than 5 min.

_HstcFXJFZyqTSkmsEtzUQ	4	2014-06-24 00:00:00	Oh my goodness... this is probably one of my favorite Thai places in Las Vegas. It's not really a hole in wall because everyone knows about it and just how good it is. \n\nMy first tip make reservations! There's not a lot of seating so when it gets busy (which is usually all the time), the wait can become pretty long! Oh and make sure that most of the party is there or they won't seat you. This can be frustrating but understandable as they are extremely busy at all times. There is a little patio out front which is a great spot to grab a drink while you wait for your table.  \n\nNow the food - my favorite dish is the Short Rib Fried Rice... it's like crack. No matter how much I eat of it, it's NEVER enough. Another great dish (as an appetizer) is the Waterfall Beef. The sauce that comes with this dish is to die for. Another great dish is just their Pad Thai. I have also tried a number of other dishes and I am never disappointed. Another tip - when you order the server will inquire how spicy (1-5) you would like your dish. I did a 3 the first time I was there, and I almost died from the spice (and I love spicy food), so be careful. :)\n\nIf you're downtown - this is a no-brainer, defiantly check this place out. You won't regret it! AND if the wait is too long... order it too go! Usually takes about 15 minutes or so to get everything prepared and it's just as good in your hotel room or at home!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	qqCVbcOU3M124wScAuPy0g	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
_KNnIq4EpcapAbj-fJRPHQ	4	2014-08-17 00:00:00	I crave this place often! Usually get the 3 color curry with brown rice.  Husband loves the jerky with sticky rice.  The dipping sauce for that so tasty.  And the wings also come with a good sauce yet already flavored.\n\nIt's different than the usual Thai paces we go which are Archie's or Pin Kaow which are also good but I think if those as more family style eating and Le Thai more you order your own meal.  Not a huge fan of their noodles mainly their curry and appetizers.  So good!

The sticky rice is great too, we always get a side of it.   The biggest thing we miss is they used to have a great drink called a grape-ade.  So good and so dangerous but they took it off the menu a while ago.   We eat here every trip and they never disappoint.	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	RxIshk9NnAr-urV8Wu4ViQ	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Pretty excited to try it out after hearing endless Zappos employees (including Tony) rave about it, so...\n\nFood: Luckily I had browsed through Yelp and I'm a huge fan of short rib so I ordered the Short Rib Fried Rice.. BEST DECISION EVER. It was amazing, to say the least. Everyone at my table that tried it said the same. The ratio of rice to short rib to vegetable was on point (get extra veggies!) and there was a good amount of heat in the dish. I also tried the Tri-Color Curry and the Pad Thai but I wasn't as impressed, I've had better in CA. The fried rice was a little pricey (~$15) but well worth it for the first time.\n\nService: Waitress was prompt with the water so that helped when the food took a while to come out. Only issue: bill can be split only 4 ways so it was a hassle exchanging cash amongst our party and some of us ended up paying more than we should have. \n\nEnvironment: Too dark! I could barely see what was in my bowl, but the outside patio area would have been awesome during the day. Overall, the bathroom was clean so not too much to gripe about. \n\nDrinks: I was looking forward to trying one of their specialty drinks.. until I saw the prices. Spiked Thai Tea for upwards of $12!? No way, but I guess the 2/5 $ was pretty accurate. \n\nOverall: I would definitely come back... for lunch and with cash. Drink were a bit too pricey for me, but the food was awesome!	2	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	KjLjePO5TKKhmdo4ZwxKHA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
_Z-la6_CKBgPmxPEfxD2Aw	5	2015-12-06 00:00:00	So my Roomate and I have gone several times now to Le Thai. We take everyone when they come to town. It's all the way on Fremont 30 mins from my house so unless I'm gonna be on Fremont I don't go. But we got some waterfall steak thing last time and it was the best!!!!!!!! They usually have a 30 min wait but that's bc it's the best Thai in Vegas. So it's worth the wait and if your down on Fremont it's a great choice \n\n\nGarlic rice beef is the best thing on the menu. I've tried like everything and I can't find a more flavorful dish	1	0	2	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	AQRqMBHwZd_hDBxnTshmKA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA

Well prepared, well seasoned, and alway tasty, you will never be unhappy with an order from Le Thai!	0	0	0	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA	I3XJNDCe50zG7ddKDCDqAA	1252	-ed0Yc9on37RoIoG2ZgxBA
